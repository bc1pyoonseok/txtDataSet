"An old conjecture of Ringel states that every tree with $m$ edges decomposes the complete graph $K_{2m+1}$. The best known lower bound for the order of a complete graph which admits a decomposition by every given tree with $m$ edges is $O(m^3)$. We show that asymptotically almost surely a random tree with $m$ edges and $p=2m+1$ a prime decomposes $K_{2m+1}(r)$ for every $r\ge 2$, the graph obtained from the complete graph $K_{2m+1}$ by replacing each vertex by a coclique of order $r$. Based on this result we show, among other results, that a random tree with $m+1$ edges a.a.s. decomposes the compete graph $K_{6m+5}$ minus one edge. "
"We consider a scenario in which a database stores sensitive data of users and an analyst wants to estimate statistics of the data. The users may suffer a cost when their data are used in which case they should be compensated. The analyst wishes to get an accurate estimate, while the users want to maximize their utility. We want to design a mechanism that can estimate statistics accurately without compromising users' privacy. Since users' costs and sensitive data may be correlated, it is important to protect the privacy of both data and cost. We model this correlation by assuming that a user's unknown sensitive data determines a distribution from a set of publicly known distributions and a user's cost is drawn from that distribution. We propose a stronger model of privacy preserving mechanism where users are compensated whenever they reveal information about their data to the mechanism. In this model, we design a Bayesian incentive compatible and privacy preserving mechanism that guarantees accuracy and protects the privacy of both cost and data. "
"We study the existence of simple closed geodesics on most (in the sense of Baire category) Alexandrov surfaces with curvature bounded below, compact and without boundary. We show that it depends on both the curvature bound and the topology of the surfaces. "
"In this paper we derive an extra class of non-Markovian master equations where the system state is written as a sum of auxiliary matrixes whose evolution involve Lindblad contributions with local coupling between all of them, resembling the structure of a classical rate equation. The system dynamics may develops strong non-local effects such as the dependence of the stationary properties with the system initialization. These equations are derived from alternative microscopic interactions, such as complex environments described in a generalized Born-Markov approximation and tripartite system-environment interactions, where extra unobserved degrees of freedom mediates the entanglement between the system and a Markovian reservoir. Conditions that guarantees the completely positive condition of the solution map are found. Quantum stochastic processes that recover the system dynamics in average are formulated. We exemplify our results by analyzing the dynamical action of non-trivial structured dephasing and depolarizing reservoirs over a single qubit. "
"I review how traditional grand unified theories, which require adjoint (or higher representation) Higgs fields for breaking to the standard model, can be contained within string theory. The status (as of January 1996) of the search for stringy free fermionic three generation SO(10) SUSY--GUT models is discussed. Progress in free fermionic classification of both SO(10)$_2$ charged and uncharged embeddings and in $N=1$ spacetime solutions is presented. Based on talks presented at the Workshop on SUSY Phenomena and SUSY GUTs, Santa Barbara, California, Dec. 7-11, 1995, and at the Orbis Scientiae, Coral Gables, Florida, January 25-28, 1996. Appearing in the Proceedings of Orbis Scientiae, 1996. "
"Consider a monotone Boolean function $f:\{0,1\}^n\to\{0,1\}$ and the canonical monotone coupling $\{\eta_p:p\in[0,1]\}$ of an element in $\{0,1\}^n$ chosen according to product measure with intensity $p\in[0,1]$. The random point $p\in[0,1]$ where $f(\eta_p)$ flips from $0$ to $1$ is often concentrated near a particular point, thus exhibiting a threshold phenomenon. For a sequence of such Boolean functions, we peer closely into this threshold window and consider, for large $n$, the limiting distribution (properly normalized to be nondegenerate) of this random point where the Boolean function switches from being 0 to 1. We determine this distribution for a number of the Boolean functions which are typically studied and pay particular attention to the functions corresponding to iterated majority and percolation crossings. It turns out that these limiting distributions have quite varying behavior. In fact, we show that any nondegenerate probability measure on $\mathbb{R}$ arises in this way for some sequence of Boolean functions. "
"Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) of 31P and 51V nuclei has been measured in a spin-1/2 alternating-chain compound (VO)_2P_2O_7. By analyzing the temperature variation of the 31P NMR spectra, we have found that (VO)_2P_2O_7 has two independent spin components with different spin-gap energies. The spin gaps are determined from the temperature dependence of the shifts at 31P and 51V sites to be 35 K and 68 K, which are in excellent agreement with those observed in the recent inelastic neutron scattering experiments [A.W. Garrett et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 79, 745 (1997)]. This suggests that (VO)_2P_2O_7 is composed of two magnetic subsystems showing distinct magnetic excitations, which are associated with the two crystallographically-inequivalent V chains running along the b axis. The difference of the spin-gap energies between the chains is attributed to the small differences in the V-V distances, which may result in the different exchange alternation in each magnetic chain. The exchange interactions in each alternating chain are estimated and are discussed based on the empirical relation between the exchange interaction and the interatomic distance. "
"We have obtained spectra of 163 quasars at $z_\mathrm{em}>4.4$ with the Gemini Multi Object Spectrometers on the Gemini North and South telescopes, the largest publicly available sample of high-quality, low-resolution spectra at these redshifts. From this homogeneous data set, we generated stacked quasar spectra in three redshift intervals at $z\sim 5$. We have modelled the flux below the rest-frame Lyman limit ($\lambda_\mathrm{r}<912$\AA) to assess the mean free path $\lambda_\mathrm{mfp}^{912}$ of the intergalactic medium to HI-ionizing radiation. At mean redshifts $z_\mathrm{q}=4.56$, 4.86 and 5.16, we measure $\lambda_\mathrm{mfp}^{912}=(22.2\pm 2.3, 15.1\pm 1.8, 10.3\pm 1.6)h_{70}^{-1}$ proper Mpc with uncertainties dominated by sample variance. Combining our results with $\lambda_\mathrm{mfp}^{912}$ measurements from lower redshifts, the data are well modelled by a simple power-law $\lambda_\mathrm{mfp}^{912}=A[(1+z)/5]^\eta$ with $A=(37\pm 2)h_{70}^{-1}$ Mpc and $\eta = -5.4\pm 0.4$ between $z=2.3$ and $z=5.5$. This rapid evolution requires a physical mechanism -- beyond cosmological expansion -- which reduces the cosmic effective Lyman limit opacity. We speculate that the majority of HI Lyman limit opacity manifests in gas outside galactic dark matter haloes, tracing large-scale structures (e.g. filaments) whose average density (and consequently neutral fraction) decreases with cosmic time. Our measurements of the strongly redshift-dependent mean free path shortly after the completion of HI reionization serve as a valuable boundary condition for numerical models thereof. Having measured $\lambda_\mathrm{mfp}^{912}\approx 10$ Mpc at $z=5.2$, we confirm that the intergalactic medium is highly ionized by that epoch and that the redshift evolution of the mean free path does not show a break that would indicate a recent end to HI reionization. "
"Using SU(3) lattice QCD, we perform the first systematic study for the ground-state three-quark (3Q) potential $V_{\rm 3Q}^{\rm g.s.}$ and the 1st excited-state 3Q potential $V_{\rm 3Q}^{\rm e.s.}$, {\it i.e.}, the energies of the ground state and the 1st excited state of the gluon field in the presence of the static three quarks. From the accurate and thorough calculation for more than 300 different patterns of 3Q systems, the static ground-state 3Q potential $V_{\rm 3Q}^{\rm g.s.}$ is found to be well described by the Coulomb plus Y-type linear potential, {\it i.e.}, Y-Ansatz, within 1%-level deviation. As a clear evidence for Y-Ansatz, Y-type flux-tube formation is actually observed on the lattice in maximally-Abelian projected QCD. For more than 100 patterns of 3Q systems, we calculate the 1st excited-state 3Q potential $V_{\rm 3Q}^{\rm e.s.}$ in quenched lattice QCD, and find the gluonic excitation energy $\Delta E_{\rm 3Q} \equiv V_{\rm 3Q}^{\rm e.s.}-V_{\rm 3Q}^{\rm g.s.}$ to be about 1 GeV. This large gluonic-excitation energy is conjectured to ensure the success of the quark model for the low-lying hadrons even without gluonic excitations. "
"The purpose of the study is to further investigate the classical Gibbs analysis of the heterogeneous system ""stressed crystal - melt."" It is demonstrated that each equilibrium configuration is stable with respect to a special class of variations introduced by Gibbs. This basic result is compared with the opposite result on the universal morphological instability of phase interface separating a stressed crystal with its melt. Some plausible manifestations of the instabilities implied by the Gibbs model are qualitatively discussed. "
"Holonomy corrections to scalar perturbations are investigated in the loop quantum cosmology framework. Due to the effective approach, modifications of the algebra of constraints generically lead to anomalies. In order to remove those anomalies, counter-terms are introduced. We find a way to explicitly fulfill the conditions for anomaly freedom and we give explicit expressions for the counter-terms. Surprisingly, the ""new quantization scheme"" naturally arises in this procedure. The gauge invariant variables are found and equations of motion for the anomaly-free scalar perturbations are derived. Finally, some cosmological consequences are discussed qualitatively. "
"We consider the sums $S(k)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^{nk}}{(2n+1)^k}$ and $\zeta(2k)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^{2k}}$ with $k$ being a positive integer. We evaluate these sums with multiple integration, a modern technique. First, we start with three different double integrals that have been previously used in the literature to show $S(2)=\pi^2/8,$ which implies Euler's identity $\zeta(2)=\pi^2/6.$ Then, we generalize each integral in order to find the considered sums. The $k$ dimensional analogue of the first integral is the density function of the quotient of $k$ independent, nonnegative Cauchy random variables. In seeking this function, we encounter a special logarithmic integral that we can directly relate to $S(k).$ The $k$ dimensional analogue of the second integral, upon a change of variables, is the volume of a convex polytope, which can be expressed as a probability involving certain pairwise sums of $k$ independent uniform random variables. We use combinatorial arguments to find the volume, which in turn gives new closed formulas for $S(k)$ and $\zeta(2k).$ The $k$ dimensional analogue of the last integral, upon another change of variables, is an integral of the joint density function of $k$ Cauchy random variables over a hyperbolic polytope. This integral can be expressed as a probability involving certain pairwise products of these random variables, and it is equal to the probability from the second generalization. Thus, we specifically highlight the similarities in the combinatorial arguments between the second and third generalizations. "
"The family of negative torus links $T_{p,q}$ over a fixed number of strands $p$ admits a stable limit in reduced Khovanov homology as $q$ grows to infinity. In this paper, we endow this stable space with a bi-graded commutative algebra structure. We describe these algebras explicitly for $p=2,3,4$. As an application, we compute the homology of two families of links, and produce a lower bound for the width of the homology of any $4$-stranded torus link. "
"The spring-mass system studied in undergraduate physics laboratories may show complex dynamics due to the simultaneous action of gravitational, elastic, and torsional forces, in addition to air friction. In this paper, we describe a laboratory exercise that caters to beginning students while giving those with more background an opportunity to explore more complex aspects of the motion. If students are not given predefined apparatus but are allowed to design the experiment setup, they may also learn something about physics thinking and experimental procedure. Using results thus produced, we describe a variety of spring-mass oscillation patterns, discussing the physics of the significant deviations from simple harmonic motion. The parametric oscillation behavior we have observed is reported and investigated. This study is based on analysis of motion waveforms. "
"Path-integral Monte Carlo calculations were performed to study the adsorption of $^4$He atoms on $\alpha$-graphyne. We find that one $^4$He atom can be embedded onto the in-plane center of each hexagon of the graphyne. In the first $^4$He layer above the $^4$He-embedded graphyne surface, a Mott insulating state was observed at the areal density of 0.0706 \AA$^{-2}$ with three $^4$He atoms occupying each hexagonal cell while the helium atoms form a commensurate triangular solid at a density of 0.0941 \AA$^{-2}$. Here we show that the Ising pseudo-spin symmetry introduced for two degenerate configurations of three $^4$He atoms in a hexagonal cell can be broken by additional $^4$He atoms placed at the hexagon vertices and the Mott-insulator to commensurate-solid transition is a transition from a nonmagnetic spin liquid of frustrated antiferromagnets to a spin-aligned ferromagnet under a particle-induced pseudo-magnetic field. "
"We propose a unification scenario for supersymmetric intersecting brane models. The quarks and leptons are embedded into adjoint representations of SO(32), which are obtained and break by type I string compactified on orbifolds. Its single unified gauge coupling can give rise to different gauge couplings below the unification scale, due to effects of magnetic fluxes. The crucial mechanism is brane recombination preserving supersymmetry. "
"We study two kinds of transformation groups of a compact locally conformally Kahler (l.c.K.) manifold. First we study compact l.c.K. manifolds with parallel Lee form by means of the existence of a holomorphic l.c.K. flow. Next, we introduce the Lee-Cauchy-Riemann (LCR) transformations as a class of diffeomorphisms preserving the specific G-structure of l.c.K. manifolds. We show that compact l.c.K. manifolds admitting a non-compact CC^* flow of LCR transformations are rigid: it is holomorphically conformal to a Hopf manifold with parallel Lee form. "
We consider a multi-string configuration that provides a new way to compute the expectation value of the Polyakov loop in a five-dimensional framework known as AdS/QCD. The obtained results are in reasonably good agreement with those obtained by lattice simulations for pure SU(3) gauge theory and also by the usual single string configuration.
"The angular distribution and differential branching fraction of the decay $B^{+} \rightarrow K^{+}\mu^{+}\mu^{-}$ are studied with a dataset corresponding to $1.0\,\mathrm{fb}^{-1}$ of integrated luminosity, collected by the LHCb experiment. The angular distribution is measured in bins of dimuon invariant mass squared and found to be consistent with Standard Model expectations. Integrating the differential branching fraction over the full dimuon invariant mass range yields a total branching fraction of $\mathcal{B}(B^{+} \rightarrow K^{+}\mu^{+}\mu^{-}) = (4.36 \pm 0.15 \pm 0.18)\times 10^{-7}$. These measurements are the most precise to date of the $B^{+} \rightarrow K^{+}\mu^{+}\mu^{-}$ decay. "
"We extend some results of Marmi--Moussa--Yoccoz on the cohomological equations and local conjugacy classes of interval exchange maps of restricted Roth type. In particular, we answer a question of Krikorian about the codimension of the local conjugacy class of self-similar interval exchange maps associated to the Eierlegende Wollmilchsau and the Ornithorynque. "
"Using operator algebraic methods we show that the moment generating function of charge transport in a system with infinitely many non-interacting Fermions is given by a determinant of a certain operator in the one-particle Hilbert space. The formula is equivalent to a formula of Levitov and Lesovik in the finite dimensional case and may be viewed as its regularized form in general. Our result embodies two tenets often realized in mesoscopic physics, namely, that the transport properties are essentially independent of the length of the leads and of the depth of the Fermi sea. "
"Bayesian experimental design (BED) is a tool for guiding experiments founded on the principle of expected information gain. I.e., which experiment design will inform the most about the model can be predicted before experiments in a laboratory are conducted. BED is also useful when specific physical questions arise from the model which are answered from certain experiments but not from other experiments. BED can take two forms, and these two forms are expressed in three example models in this work. The first example takes the form of a Bayesian linear regression, but also this example is a benchmark for checking numerical and analytical solutions. One of two parameters is an estimator of the synthetic experimental data, and the BED task is choosing among which of the two parameters to inform (limited experimental observability). The second example is a chemical reaction model with a parameter space of informed reaction free energy and temperature. The temperature is an independent experimental design variable explored for information gain. The second and third examples are of the form of adjusting an independent variable in the experimental setup. The third example is a catalytic membrane reactor similar to a plug-flow reactor. For this example, a grid search over the independent variables, temperature and volume, for the greatest information gain is conducted. Also, maximum information gain is conducted is optimized with two algorithms: the differential evolution algorithm and steepest ascent, both of which benefitted in terms of initial guess from the grid search. "
"We present a census of circumstellar disks in the Chamaeleon I star-forming region. Using the Infrared Array Camera and the Multiband Imaging Photometer onboard the Spitzer Space Telescope, we have obtained images of Chamaeleon I at 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, 8.0, and 24 um. To search for new disk-bearing members of the cluster, we have performed spectroscopy on objects that have red colors in these data. Through this work, we have discovered four new members of Chamaeleon I with spectral types of M4, M6, M7.5, and L0. The first three objects are highly embedded (A_J~5) and reside near known protostars, indicating that they may be among the youngest low-mass sources in the cluster (<1 Myr). The L0 source is the coolest known member of Chamaeleon I. Its luminosity implies a mass of 0.004-0.01 M_sun, making it the least massive brown dwarf for which a circumstellar disk has been reliably detected. To characterize the disk population in Chamaeleon I, we have classified the infrared spectral energy distributions of the 203 known members that are encompassed by the Spitzer images. Through these classifications, we find that the disk fraction in Chamaeleon I is roughly constant at ~50% from 0.01 to 0.3 M_sun. These data are similar to the disk fraction of IC 348, which is a denser cluster at the same age as Chamaeleon I. However, the disk fraction at M>1 M_sun is significantly higher in Chamaeleon I than in IC 348 (65% vs. 20%), indicating longer disk lifetimes in Chamaeleon I for this mass range. Thus, low-density star-forming regions like Chamaeleon I may offer more time for planet formation around solar-type stars than denser clusters. "
"Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) plays a key role in biological sequence analyses, especially in phylogenetic tree construction. Extreme increase in next-generation sequencing results in shortage of efficient ultra-large biological sequence alignment approaches for coping with different sequence types. Distributed and parallel computing represents a crucial technique for accelerating ultra-large sequence analyses. Based on HAlign and Spark distributed computing system, we implement a highly cost-efficient and time-efficient HAlign-II tool to address ultra-large multiple biological sequence alignment and phylogenetic tree construction. After comparing with most available state-of-the-art methods, our experimental results indicate the following: 1) HAlign-II can efficiently carry out MSA and construct phylogenetic trees with ultra-large biological sequences; 2) HAlign-II shows extremely high memory efficiency and scales well with increases in computing resource; 3) HAlign-II provides a user-friendly web server based on our distributed computing infrastructure. HAlign-II with open-source codes and datasets was established at http://lab.malab.cn/soft/halign. "
"For classical groups SL(n), SO(n) and Sp(2n), we define uniformly geometric valuations on the corresponding complete flag varieties. The valuation in every type comes from a natural coordinate system on the open Schubert cell and is combinatorially related to the Gelfand-Zetlin pattern in the same type. In types A and C, we identify the corresponding Newton-Okounkov polytopes with the Feigin-Fourier-Littelmann-Vinberg polytopes. In types B and D, we compute low-dimensional examples and formulate open questions. "
"Non-Abelian discrete family symmetries play a pivotal role in the formulation of models with tri-bimaximal lepton mixing. We discuss how to obtain symmetries such as A4, semidirect product of Z7 and Z3, and Delta(27) from an underlying SU(3) gauge symmetry. Higher irreducible representations are required to achieve the spontaneous breaking of the continuous group. We present methods of identifying the required vacuum alignments and discuss in detail the symmetry breaking potentials. "
"Brain metabolism is controlled by complex regulation mechanisms. As part of their nature many complex systems show scaling behavior in their timeseries data. Corresponding scaling exponents can sometimes be used to characterize these systems. Here we present maps of scaling exponents derived from BOLD functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data, and show that they reveal activation patterns in the human brain with very high precision. In contrast to standard model-based analysis we use no prior knowledge on the experimental stimulation paradigm for extracting activation patterns from fMRI timeseries. We demonstrate that mental activity is one-to-one related to large fractal exponents, or equivalently, to temporally highly correlated processes. "
A relation between Schur algebras and Steenrod algebra is shown in [Hai10] where to each strict polynomial functor the author associates an unstable module. We show that the restriction of Hai's functor to the subcategory of strict polynomial functors of a given degree is fully faithfull.
"In this paper we design an iterative domain decomposition method for free boundary problems with nonlinear flux jump condition. Our approach is related to damped Newton's methods. The proposed scheme requires, in each iteration, the approximation of the flux on (both sides of) the free interface. We present a Finite Element implementation of our method. The numerical implementation uses harmonically deformed triangulations to inexpensively generate finite element meshes in subdomains. We apply our method to a simplified model for jet flows in pipes and to a simple magnetohydrodynamics model. Finally, we present numerical examples studying the convergence of our scheme. "
"We study the band dispersion of graphene with randomly distributed structural defects using two complementary methods, exact diagonalization of the tight-binding Hamiltonian and implementing a self-consistent T matrix approximation. We identify three distinct types of impurities resulting in qualitatively different spectra in the vicinity of the Dirac point. First, resonant impurities, such as vacancies or 585 defects, lead to stretching of the spectrum at the Dirac point with a finite density of localized states. This type of spectrum has been observed in epitaxial graphene by photoemission spectroscopy and discussed extensively in the literature. Second, nonresonant (weak) impurities, such as paired vacancies or Stone-Wales defects, do not stretch the spectrum but provide a line broadening that increases with energy. Finally, disorder that breaks sublattice symmetry, such as vacancies placed in only one sublattice, open a gap around the Dirac point and create an impurity band in the middle of this gap. We find good agreement between the results of the two methods and also with the experimentally measured spectra. "
"In order to construct a dielectric analog of spaser, we study theoretically and experimentally several configurations of cluster-based unit cells for an all-dielectric metasurface characterized by resonant conditions of the trapped mode excitation. Excitation of the trapped mode is realized by either specific displacement of particles in the cluster, or perturbation of the equidistantly spaced particles by off-centered round holes or coaxial-sector notches. It turns out that the latter approach is more advantageous for enhancement of electric near-field with homogeneous distribution in-plane of the structure and its strong localization outside the high-refractive-index dielectric particles. This feature opens prospects for realization of highly desirable subwavelength flat lasing structures based on strong near-field interaction with substances exhibiting pronounced nonlinear characteristics and properties of gain media. "
"To characterize the possible magnetic structures created on magnetic multilayers a model has been formulated and studied. The interlayer inhomogeneous structures found indicate either (i) a regular periodic, (ii) a quasiperiodic change in the magnetization or (iii) spatially chaotic glass states. The magnetic structures created depend mainly on the ratio of the magnetic anisotropy constant to the exchange constant. With the increase of this ratio the periodic structures first transform into the quasiperiodic and then into the chaotic glass states. The same tendency arises with the depolarization of the magnetic moments of the first layer deposited on the substrate. "
"We find families of prime knot diagrams with arbitrary extreme coefficients in their Jones polynomials. Some graph theory is presented in connection with this problem, generalizing ideas by Yongju Bae and Morton and giving a positive answer to a question in their paper. "
"Photon-induced near-field electron microscopy (PINEM) is a currently developing spectral approach that characterizes quantum electron-light interactions in electron energy gain/loss spectrum, with symmetrically discretized gains or losses of light quanta ($\hbar \omega$), coupled with a laser induced optical near-field. In this letter, we have demonstrated that Linear Particle Accelerator (LPA) and anomalous PINEM (APINEM) can analytically emerge from PINEM-kind interaction in a strong coupling regime, because of quantum interference of spectral photon sidebands overlap. Furthermore, we also found that the quantum interference in point-particle regime with pre-interaction drift can produce interesting optical spectral focusing and a periodically bunching of energy/momentum distribution that enable us to improve the spectral resolution of electron microscopy, imaging and spectroscopy. These observation of LPA and APINEM in strong laser physics can be of great interests for both theoretical and experimental communities, such as ultrafast electron microscopes, attosecond science and laser-driven accelerators. "
"We study bilayer fermionic cold atom systems with dipolar interactions, as well as a two-component tunable pseudopotential (TCTP) model which keeps only the zeroth and first Haldane pseudopotentials, at total Landau level filling factor 1/2. Our numerical results on the TCTP model indicates that Haldane-Rezayi state describes the critical point between strong and weak d-wave pairing quantum Hall phases. Further increasing the attractive zeroth pseudopotentials, the system transits from the strong-pairing phase to a stripe phase, and then to a cluster phase (or phase separation). The dipolar interaction can be mapped onto the TCTP model in the strong-pairing phase, if high order pseudopotentials are ignored. Our numerical results show that this is indeed the case, so the strong-pairing phase can be realized in the cold atom system. "
"Representational similarity analysis (RSA) has been shown to be an effective framework to characterize brain-activity profiles and deep neural network activations as representational geometry by computing the pairwise distances of the response patterns as a representational dissimilarity matrix (RDM). However, how to properly analyze and visualize the representational geometry as dynamics over the time course from stimulus onset to offset is not well understood. In this work, we formulated the pipeline to understand representational dynamics with RDM movies and Procrustes-aligned Multidimensional Scaling (pMDS), and applied it to neural recording of monkey IT cortex. Our results suggest that the the multidimensional scaling alignment can genuinely capture the dynamics of the category-specific representation spaces with multiple visualization possibilities, and that object categorization may be hierarchical, multi-staged, and oscillatory (or recurrent). "
"The purpose of the present paper is to investigate some structural and qualitative aspects of two different perturbations of the parameters of $g$-fractions. In this context the concept of \emph{gap} $g$-fractions is introduced. While tail sequences of a continued fraction play a significant role in the first perturbation, Schur fractions are used in the second perturbation of the $g$-parameters that are considered. Illustrations are provided using Gaussian hypergeometric functions. Using a particular gap $g$-fraction, some members of the class of Pick functions are also identified. "
"The Oeljeklaus-Toma (OT-) manifolds are complex manifolds constructed by Oeljeklaus and Toma from certain number fields, and generalizing the Inoue surfaces $S_m$. On each OT-manifold we construct a holomorphic line bundle with semipositive curvature form and trivial Chern class. Using this form, we prove that the OT-manifolds admitting a locally conformally Kahler structure have no non-trivial complex subvarieties. The proof is based on the Strong Approximation theorem for number fields, which implies that any leaf of the null-foliation of w is Zariski dense. "
"The radiation pressure exerted by incoherent light on diverse surfaces is examined. The thermodynamic rule, first given by Carnot in 1824, describes the limitation to the amount of free energy that can be obtained from a source of thermal energy, and he gave the compelling reason for this rule, that if more free energy than he had prescribed could ever be extracted, then a heat pump could use that free energy and re-create all the heat energy that had been consumed. A perpetual motion machine could then be constructed. Now, 179 years later, it is proposed to fly a spacecraft that is expected to gain velocity from the radiation pressure the sunlight is expected to exert on solar sails, panels of thin plastic sheets, mirror surfaced on the side facing the sun. However a detailed examination of this proposal shows it to be in direct conflict with Carnot's rule, and no such pressure can be expected. Either Carnot's accepted rule is in error, or the solar sail proposal will not work at all. "
"The coupling of internal electronic excitations to vibrational modes of the external motion of ultracold atoms in an optical lattice is studied here in using a perturbation expansion in small atomic displacements. In the Mott insulator case with one atom per site, the resonance dipole-dipole coupling between neighboring sites can induce emission and absorption of vibrational quanta. Within a cavity in the strong exciton-photon coupling regime such coupling results in polariton-vibration interactions, which create a significant thermalization mechanism for polaritons toward their minimum energy, and leading to motional heating of the lattice atoms. "
"We present images of the recent galaxy merger NGC 3256 obtained with the WFPC2 of the Hubble Space Telescope in B and I filters. We show that there is a large population of more than 1,000 compact, bright blue objects in this galaxy within the 7 kpc x 7 kpc region studied. These objects have sizes, colors and luminosities like those expected for young Galactic globular clusters with ages ranging from a few to several hundred Myr. On this basis, we identify at least some fraction of the compact, bright blue objects in NGC 3256 as young globular clusters. The young cluster system comprises 15-20% of the luminosity of the galaxy in B and half that in I within the region studied, indicating a high efficiency of cluster formation on a galaxy-wide scale. We find that the intrinsic color distribution is broad, and there is no significant trend of color with magnitude. The combination of the broad range of observed colors and the lack of a trend of redder colors at fainter magnitudes can not be fit solely by a broad age distribution and/or differential reddening, although the latter is clearly present. The observations can be accounted for by either the preferential depletion/destruction of lower mass clusters as they age, or a very young age (<= 20 Myr) for the cluster population, comparable to or less than the dynamical time of the region in which the clusters are observed. We also find that the luminosity function of the young cluster system can be roughly fit by a power-law with an exponent of -1.8, with tentative evidence that it flattens at faint magnitudes. The clusters are compact in size, with typical estimated half-light radii of 5-10 parsecs, but there is no obvious cut-off for larger radii, and only a shallow trend of size with luminosity. (slightly abridged). "
"Numerical studies of the May-Leonard model for cyclically competing species exhibit spontaneous spatial structures in the form of spirals. It is desirable to obtain a simple coarse-grained evolution equation describing spatio-temporal pattern formation in such spatially extended stochastic population dynamics models. Extending earlier work on the corresponding deterministic system, we derive the complex Ginzburg-Landau equation as the effective representation of the fully stochastic dynamics of this paradigmatic model for cyclic dominance near its Hopf bifurcation, and for small fluctuations in the three-species coexistence regime. The internal stochastic reaction noise is accounted for through the Doi-Peliti coherent-state path integral formalism, and subsequent mapping to three coupled non-linear Langevin equations. This analysis provides constraints on the model parameters that allow time scale separation and in consequence a further reduction to just two coarse-grained slow degrees of freedom. "
"We study electron-electron contact-interaction searches in the process e^+e^-\to e^+e^- at a future e^+e^- Linear Collider with both beams longitudinally polarized. We evaluate the model-independent constraints on the coupling constants, emphasizing the role of beam polarization, and make a comparison with the case of e^+e^-\to\mu^+\mu^-. "
"One way to model the strange metal phase of certain materials is via a holographic description in terms of probe D-branes in a Lifshitz spacetime, characterised by a dynamical exponent z. The background geometry is dual to a strongly-interacting quantum critical theory while the probe D-branes are dual to a finite density of charge carriers that can exhibit the characteristic properties of strange metals. We compute holographically the low-frequency and low-momentum form of the charge density and current retarded Green's functions in these systems for massless charge carriers. The results reveal a quasi-particle excitation when z<2, which in analogy with Landau Fermi liquids we call zero sound. The real part of the dispersion relation depends on momentum k linearly, while the imaginary part goes as k^2/z. When z is greater than or equal to 2 the zero sound is not a well-defined quasi-particle. We also compute the frequency-dependent conductivity in arbitrary spacetime dimensions. Using that as a measure of the charge current spectral function, we find that the zero sound appears only when the spectral function consists of a single delta function at zero frequency. "
"Soergel bimodule category B is a categorification of the Hecke algebra of a Coxeter system (W,S). We find a presentation of B (as a tensor category) by generators and relations when W is a right-angled Coxeter group. "
"I demonstrate that the chiral properties of Domain Wall Fermions (DWF) in the large to intermediate lattice spacing regime of QCD, 1 to 2 GeV, are significantly improved by adding to the action two standard Wilson fermions with supercritical mass equal to the negative DWF five dimensional mass. Using quenched DWF simulations I show that the eigenvalue spectrum of the transfer matrix Hamiltonian develops a substantial gap and that the residual mass decreases appreciatively. Furthermore, I confirm that topology changing remains active and that the hadron spectrum of the added Wilson fermions is above the lattice cutoff and therefore is irrelevant. I argue that this result should also hold for dynamical DWF and furthermore that it should improve the chiral properties of related fermion methods. "
"Broadband, coherent light carrying optical angular momentum is of potential utility for a variety of classical and quantum communication applications, but at present few such sources exist. We study the generation of supercontinua in a ring array of coupled optical fibres. Short pulses carrying discrete angular momentum undergo soliton fission, spontaneously breaking azimuthal symmetry. This results in a train of pulses with a broadband frequency spectrum as well as a non-trivial angular momentum distribution. These spatio-temporal solitary waves, localised around a single fibre core, emit an unusual form of resonant radiation which can be present even in the absence of intrinsic higher order dispersion, being induced by the lattice dispersion of the ring array. We explore how the coupling properties between fibre cores affect the resulting supercontinuum, in particular how mildly twisting the array can effectively manipulate its angular momentum content and resonant frequencies through the induced Peierls phase. "
"We generalize the concept of the spin-momentum locking to magnonic systems and derive the formula to calculate the spin expectation value for one-magnon states of general two-body spin Hamiltonians. We give no-go conditions for magnon spin to be independent of momentum. As examples of the magnon spin-momentum locking, we analyze a one-dimensional antiferromagnet with the N\'eel order and two-dimensional kagome lattice antiferromagnets with the 120$^\circ$ structure. We find that the magnon spin depends on its momentum even when the Hamiltonian has the $z$-axis spin rotational symmetry, which can be explained in the context of a singular band point or a $U(1)$ symmetry breaking. A spin vortex in momentum space generated in a kagome lattice antiferromagnet has the winding number $Q=-2$, while the typical one observed in topological insulator surface states is characterized by $Q=+1$. A magnonic analogue of the surface states, the Dirac magnon with $Q=+1$, is found in another kagome lattice antiferromagnet. We also derive the sum rule for $Q$ by using the Poincar\'e-Hopf index theorem. "
"The classical paradox of social choice theory asserts that there is no fair way to deterministically select a winner in an election among more than two candidates; the only definite collective preferences are between individual pairs of candidates. Combinatorially, one may summarize this information with a graph-theoretic tournament on N vertices (one per candidate), placing an edge from U to V if U would beat V in an election between only those two candidates (no ties are permitted). One well-studied procedure for selecting a winner is to specify a complete binary tree whose leaves are labeled by the candidates, and evaluate it by running pairwise elections between the pairs of leaves, sending the winners to successive rounds of pairwise elections which ultimately terminate with a single winner. This structure is called a voting tree. Much research has investigated which functions on tournaments are computable in this way. Fischer, Procaccia, and Samorodnitsky quantitatively studied the computability of the Copeland rule, which returns a vertex of maximum out-degree in the given tournament. Perhaps surprisingly, the best previously known voting tree could only guarantee a returned out-degree of at least log_2 N, despite the fact that every tournament has a vertex of degree at least (N-1)/2. In this paper, we present three constructions, the first of which substantially improves this guarantee to \Theta(sqrt{N}). The other two demonstrate the richness of the voting tree universe, with a tree that resists manipulation, and a tree which implements arithmetic modulo three. "
"The literature on the theme of gender differences in research performance indicates a quite evident gap in favor of men over women. Beyond the understanding of the factors that could be at the basis of this phenomenon, it is worthwhile understanding if it would be appropriate to conduct the evaluation per population in a manner distinguished by gender. In fact if there is some factor that structurally determines a penalization of performance by women researchers compared to men then the comparative evaluation of organizations' performance that does not take gender into account will lead to an advantage for those that employ more men, under parity in the capacities of their staffs. In this work we measure the differences of the performance and the rank of research institutions as observed when gender is taken into account compared to when it is ignored. The study population consists of all Italian universities and the performance measured in the hard sciences for the period 2006-2010. "
"The sources of ultrahigh-energy cosmic rays (UHECRs) have been stubbornly elusive. However, the latest report of the Pierre Auger Observatory provides a compelling indication for a possible correlation between the arrival directions of UHECRs and nearby starburst galaxies. We argue that if starbursts are sources of UHECRs, then particle acceleration in the large-scale terminal shock of the superwind that flows from the starburst engine represents the best known concept model in the market. We investigate new constraints on the model and readjust free parameters accordingly. We show that UHECR acceleration above about 10^{11} GeV remains consistent with observation. We also show that the model could accommodate hard source spectra as required by Auger data. We demonstrate how neutrino emission can be used as a discriminator among acceleration models. "
"Ever brighter light sources, fast parallel detectors, and advances in phase retrieval methods, have made ptychography a practical and popular imaging technique. Compared to previous techniques, ptychography provides superior robustness and resolution at the expense of more advanced and time consuming data analysis. By taking advantage of massively parallel architectures, high-throughput processing can expedite this analysis and provide microscopists with immediate feedback. These advances allow real-time imaging at wavelength limited resolution, coupled with a large field of view. Here, we introduce a set of algorithmic and computational methodologies used at the Advanced Light Source, and DOE light sources packaged as a CUDA based software environment named SHARP (http://camera.lbl.gov/sharp), aimed at providing state-of-the-art high-throughput ptychography reconstructions for the coming era of diffraction limited light sources.

"Glycerol and trehalose-glycerol binary solutions are glass-forming liquids with remarkable bioprotectant properties. Incoherent quasielastic neutron scattering (QENS) is used to reveal the different effects of nanoconfinement and addition of trehalose on the molecular dynamics in the normal liquid and supercooled liquid phases, on a nanosecond timescale. Confinement has been realized in straight channels of diameter D=8 nm formed by porous silicon. It leads to a faster and more inhomogeneous relaxation dynamics deep in the liquid phase. This confinement effect remains at lower temperature where it affects the glassy dynamics. The glass transitions of the confined systems are shifted to low temperature with respect to the bulk ones. Adding trehalose tends to slow down the overall glassy dynamics and increases the non-exponential character of the structural relaxation. Unprecedented results are obtained for the binary bioprotectant solution, which exhibits an extremely non-Debye relaxation dynamics as a result of the combination of the effects of confinement and mixing of two constituents. "
"We generalise and offer a different proof of a recent $L^2$ square function estimate on UR sets by Hofmann, Mitrea, Mitrea and Morris. The proof is a short argument using the $\alpha$-numbers of Tolsa. "
"We have realized a dual-species Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) of $^{23}$Na and $^{87}$Rb atoms and observed their immiscibility. Because of the favorable background intra- and inter-species scattering lengths, stable condensates can be obtained via efficient evaporative cooling and sympathetic cooling without the need for fine tuning of the interactions. Our system thus provides a clean platform for studying inter-species interactions driven effects in superfluid mixtures. With a Feshbach resonance, we have successfully created double BECs with largely tunable inter-species interactions and studied the miscible-immiscible phase transition. "
"The standard treatment of gravitational lensing by a point mass lens M is based on a weak-field deflection angle a = 2/x, where x = (r c^2)/(2 G M) with r the distance of closest approach to the mass of a lensed light ray. It was shown that for a point mass lens, the total magnification and image centroid shift of a point source remain unchanged by relativistic corrections of second order in 1/x. This paper considers these issues analytically taking into account the relativistic images, under three standard lensing configuration assumptions, for a Schwarzschild black hole lens with background point and extended sources having arbitrary surface brightness profiles. We apply our results to the Galactic black hole for lensing scenarios where our assumptions hold. We show that a single factor characterizes the full relativistic correction to the weak-field image centroid and magnification. As the lens-source distance increases, the relativistic correction factor strictly decreases. In particular, we find that for point and extended sources about 10 pc behind the black hole (which is a distance significantly outside the tidal disruption radius of a sun-like source), the relativistic correction factor is miniscule, of order 10^{-14}. Therefore, for standard lensing configurations, any detectable relativistic corrections to microlensing by the Galactic black hole will most likely have to come from sources significantly closer to the black hole. "
"The Skorokhod Embedding problem is well understood when the underlying process is a Brownian motion. We examine the problem when the underlying is the simple symmetric random walk and when no external randomisation is allowed. We prove that any measure on Z can be embedded by means of a minimal stopping time. However, in sharp contrast to the Brownian setting, we show that the set of measures which can be embedded in a uniformly integrable way is strictly smaller then the set of centered probability measures: specifically it is a fractal set which we characterise as an iterated function system. Finally, we define the natural extension of several known constructions from the Brownian setting and show that these constructions require us to further restrict the sets of target laws. "
"Noncommutative geometry governs the physics of quantum Hall (QH) effects. We introduce the Weyl ordering of the second quantized density operator to explore the dynamics of electrons in the lowest Landau level. We analyze QH systems made of $N$-component electrons at the integer filling factor $\nu=k\leq N$. The basic algebra is the SU(N)-extended W$_{\infty}$. A specific feature is that noncommutative geometry leads to a spontaneous development of SU(N) quantum coherence by generating the exchange Coulomb interaction. The effective Hamiltonian is the Grassmannian $G_{N,k}$ sigma model, and the dynamical field is the Grassmannian $G_{N,k}$ field, describing $k(N-k)$ complex Goldstone modes and one kind of topological solitons (Grassmannian solitons).

"We present angle resolved photoemission spectra for Cu(100) and Cu(111) singly crystals in normal emission geometry, taken at tightly spaced intervals for photon energies between 8 eV and 150 eV. This systematic collection of spectra gives unprecedented insight into the influence of the final states to the photoemission process as well as the band structure and lifetimes of highly excited electrons in Cu. "
"The first part of this paper consists of lecture notes which summarize the machinery of filtered root invariants. A conceptual notion of ""homotopy Greek letter element"" is also introduced, and evidence is presented that it may be related to the root invariant. In the second part we compute some low dimensional root invariants of v_1-periodic elements at the prime 2. "
We consider a quantum Bose fluid confined in a triple well potential in 1D within the exact N-body Bose-Hubbard model to investigate the phenomena of intrinsic decoherence and loss of purity. Our study is done by following the time evolution of one-body properties in an N-particle closed environment. We do an exhaustive exploration of initial conditions to characterize these phenomena. Here we illustrate our main findings with a set of relevant Fock and SU(3) coherent states. Our study shows that signatures of stationarity and maximal mixing are a direct consequence of the inter-particle interactions in the closed system and become evident as the number of particles is increased. This fact is confirmed by quantifying the deviations from stationarity by means of a matrix norm.
"Self-stabilization ensures that, after any transient fault, the system recovers in a finite time and eventually exhibits. Speculation consists in guaranteeing that the system satisfies its requirements for any execution but exhibits significantly better performances for a subset of executions that are more probable. A speculative protocol is in this sense supposed to be both robust and efficient in practice. We introduce the notion of speculative stabilization which we illustrate through the mutual exclusion problem. We then present a novel speculatively stabilizing mutual exclusion protocol. Our protocol is self-stabilizing for any asynchronous execution. We prove that its stabilization time for synchronous executions is diam(g)/2 steps (where diam(g) denotes the diameter of the system). This complexity result is of independent interest. The celebrated mutual exclusion protocol of Dijkstra stabilizes in n steps (where n is the number of processes) in synchronous executions and the question whether the stabilization time could be strictly smaller than the diameter has been open since then (almost 40 years). We show that this is indeed possible for any underlying topology. We also provide a lower bound proof that shows that our new stabilization time of diam(g)/2 steps is optimal for synchronous executions, even if asynchronous stabilization is not required. "
"Feature extraction from infrared (IR) images remains a challenging task. Learning based methods that can work on raw imagery/patches have therefore assumed significance. We propose a novel multi-task extension of the widely used sparse-representation-classification (SRC) method in both single and multi-view set-ups. That is, the test sample could be a single IR image or images from different views. When expanded in terms of a training dictionary, the coefficient matrix in a multi-view scenario admits a sparse structure that is not easily captured by traditional sparsity-inducing measures such as the $l_0$-row pseudo norm. To that end, we employ collaborative spike and slab priors on the coefficient matrix, which can capture fairly general sparse structures. Our work involves joint parameter and sparse coefficient estimation (JPCEM) which alleviates the need to handpick prior parameters before classification. The experimental merits of JPCEM are substantiated through comparisons with other state-of-art methods on a challenging mid-wave IR image (MWIR) ATR database made available by the US Army Night Vision and Electronic Sensors Directorate.

"We report preliminary measurements of absolute hadronic branching fractions of Ds mesons determined using a double tag technique. These measurements are from 195 pb^{-1} of e+e- collisions recorded at center of mass energies near 4.17 GeV with the CLEO-c detector at CESR. We obtain absolute branching fractions for Ds+ decays to KS0 K+, K- K+ pi+, K- K+ pi+ pi-, pi+ pi+ pi-, pi+ eta, and pi+ etaprime. We discuss the problems inherent in measuring accurately the branching fraction for Ds+ to phi pi+, which is often used as a reference mode for measurement of other Ds+ branching fractions, and provide a measurement of a branching fraction that may be useful for this purpose. "
"We present a catalog of quasars selected from broad-band photometric ugri data of the Kilo-Degree Survey Data Release 3 (KiDS DR3). The QSOs are identified by the random forest (RF) supervised machine learning model, trained on SDSS DR14 spectroscopic data. We first cleaned the input KiDS data from entries with excessively noisy, missing or otherwise problematic measurements. Applying a feature importance analysis, we then tune the algorithm and identify in the KiDS multiband catalog the 17 most useful features for the classification, namely magnitudes, colors, magnitude ratios, and the stellarity index. We used the t-SNE algorithm to map the multi-dimensional photometric data onto 2D planes and compare the coverage of the training and inference sets. We limited the inference set to r<22 to avoid extrapolation beyond the feature space covered by training, as the SDSS spectroscopic sample is considerably shallower than KiDS. This gives 3.4 million objects in the final inference sample, from which the random forest identified 190,000 quasar candidates. Accuracy of 97%, purity of 91%, and completeness of 87%, as derived from a test set extracted from SDSS and not used in the training, are confirmed by comparison with external spectroscopic and photometric QSO catalogs overlapping with the KiDS footprint. The robustness of our results is strengthened by number counts of the quasar candidates in the r band, as well as by their mid-infrared colors available from WISE. An analysis of parallaxes and proper motions of our QSO candidates found also in Gaia DR2 suggests that a probability cut of p(QSO)>0.8 is optimal for purity, whereas p(QSO)>0.7 is preferable for better completeness. Our study presents the first comprehensive quasar selection from deep high-quality KiDS data and will serve as the basis for versatile studies of the QSO population detected by this survey. "
"The Kalb-Ramond (KR) antisymmetric tensor field arises naturally in the gravitational multiplet of string theory. Nevertheless, the respective low-energy field theory action, in which, for reasons of gauge invariance, the only dependence on the KR field is through its field strength, constitutes an interesting model \emph{per se}. In this context, the KR field strength also acts as a totally antisymmetric torsion field, while in four space-time dimensions is \emph{dual} to an (KR) axion-like pseudoscalar field. In this context, we review here first the r\^ole of quantum fluctuations of the KR axion on the generation of Majorana mass for neutrinos, via a mixing with ordinary axions that may exist in the theory as providers of dark matter candidates. Then we proceed to discuss the r\^ole of constant in time (thus Lorentz violating) KR torsion backgrounds, that may exist in the early Universe but are completely negligible today, on inducing Leptogenesis by means of \emph{tree-level} CP violating decays of Right Handed Massive Majorana neutrinos in the presence of such H-torsion backgrounds. Some speculations regarding microscopic D-brane world models, where such scenarios may be realised, are also given. "
In this paper we give a combinatorial parametrization of leading terms of defining relations for level $k$ standard modules for affine Lie algebra of type $C_{n}\sp{(1)}$. Using this parametrization we conjecture colored Rogers-Ramanujan type combinatorial identities for $n\geq 2$ and $k\geq 2$; the identity in the case $n=k=1$ is equivalent to one of Capparelli's identities.
"Noticeable deviations from the prediction of the fiducial LCDM cosmology are found in the angular power spectrum of the CMB. Besides large-angle anomalies, the WMAP 1st year data revealed a dip in the power spectrum at l \sim 200, which seemed to disappear in the 3rd year and subsequent angular power spectra. Using the WMAP 1st, 3rd, and 5th year data as well as the 5 year coadded data, we study the intensity and spatial distribution of this feature in order to unveil its origin and its implications for the cosmological parameters. We show that in all WMAP data releases there is a substantial suppression of the first Doppler peak in a region near the north ecliptic pole. "
"For any atoroidal iwip $\phi \in Out(F_N)$ the mapping torus group $G_\phi=F_N\rtimes_\phi <t>e$ is hyperbolic, and the embedding $\iota: F_N \overset{\lhd}{\longrightarrow} G_\phi$ induces a continuous, $F_N$-equivariant and surjective {\em Cannon-Thurston map} $\hat \iota: \partial F_N \to \partial G_\phi$. We prove that for any $\phi$ as above, the map $\hat \iota$ is finite-to-one and that the preimage of every point of $\partial G_\phi$ has cardinality $\le 2N$. We also prove that every point $S\in \partial G_\phi$ with $\ge 3$ preimages in $\partial F_N$ has the form $(wt^m)^\infty$ where $w\in F_N, m\ne 0$, and that there are at most $4N-5$ distinct $F_N$-orbits of such {\em singular} points in $\partial G_\phi$ (for the translation action of $F_N$ on $\partial G_\phi$). By contrast, we show that for $k=1,2$ there are uncountably many points $S\in \partial G_\phi$ (and thus uncountably many $F_N$-orbits of such $S$) with exactly $k$ preimages in $\partial F_N$. "
"The abundance of open-source code, coupled with the success of recent advances in deep learning for natural language processing, has given rise to a promising new application of machine learning to source code. In this work, we explore the use of a Siamese recurrent neural network model on Python source code to create vectors which capture the semantics of code. We evaluate the quality of embeddings by identifying which problem from a programming competition the code solves. Our model significantly outperforms a bag-of-tokens embedding, providing promising results for improving code embeddings that can be used in future software engineering tasks. "
"A new calculation of R_{dAu} has been performed using the 2003 d+Au data and the higher-statistics 2005 p+p data. These nuclear modification factors are compared to calculations using nuclear-modified PDFs and a J/psi breakup cross section is extracted. These values are then used to project the cold nuclear matter effects in Au+Au collisions. Additionally, a more data-driven projection is performed. "
"For any odd integer N, we explicitly write down the Eisenstein cycles in the first homology group of modular curves of level N as linear combinations of Manin symbols. These cycles are, by definition, those over which every integral of holomorphic differential forms vanish. Our result can be seen as an explicit version of the Manin-Drinfeld Theorem. Our method is to characterize such Eisenstein cycles as eigenvectors for the Hecke operators. We make crucial use of expressions of Hecke actions on modular symbols and on auxiliary level 2 structures. "
"Using methods of condensed matter and statistical physics, we examine the transport of excitons through the Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) complex from a receiving antenna to a reaction center. Writing the equations of motion for the exciton creation/annihilation operators, we are able to describe the exciton dynamics, even in the regime when the reorganization energy is of the order of the intra-system couplings. In particular, we obtain the well-known quantum oscillations of the site populations. We determine the exciton transfer efficiency in the presence of a quenching field and protein environment. While the majority of the protein vibronic modes are treated as a heat bath, we address the situation when specific modes are strongly coupled to excitons and examine the effects of these modes on the quantum oscillations and the energy transfer efficiency. We find that, for the vibronic frequencies below 16 meV, the exciton transfer is drastically suppressed. We attribute this effect to the formation of ""polaronic states"" where the exciton is transferred back and forth between the two pigments with the absorption/emission of the vibronic quanta, instead of proceeding to the reaction center. The same effect suppresses the quantum beating at the vibronic frequency of 25 meV. We also show that the efficiency of the energy transfer can be enhanced when the vibronic mode strongly couples to the third pigment only, instead of coupling to the entire system. "
"The financial crisis has dramatically demonstrated that the traditional approach to apply univariate monetary risk measures to single institutions does not capture sufficiently the perilous systemic risk that is generated by the interconnectedness of the system entities and the corresponding contagion effects. This has brought awareness of the urgent need for novel approaches that capture systemic riskiness. The purpose of this paper is to specify a general methodological framework that is flexible enough to cover a wide range of possibilities to design systemic risk measures via multi-dimensional acceptance sets and aggregation functions, and to study corresponding examples. Existing systemic risk measures can usually be interpreted as the minimal capital needed to secure the system after aggregating individual risks. In contrast, our approach also includes systemic risk measures that can be interpreted as the minimal capital funds that secure the aggregated system by allocating capital to the single institutions before aggregating the individual risks. This allows for a possible ranking of the institutions in terms of systemic riskiness measured by the optimal allocations. Moreover, we also allow for the possibility of allocating the funds according to the future state of the system (random allocation). We provide conditions which ensure monotonicity, convexity, or quasi-convexity properties of our systemic risk measures. "
"In this paper we extend the coupled fixed point theorems for mixed monotone operators $F:X \times X \rightarrow X$ obtained in [T.G. Bhaskar, V. Lakshmikantham, \textit{Fixed point theorems in partially ordered metric spaces and applications}, Nonlinear Anal. TMA \textbf{65} (2006) 1379-1393] by significantly weakening the involved contractive condition. Our technique of proof is essentially different and more natural. An example as well an application to periodic BVP are also given in order to illustrate the effectiveness of our generalizations. "
"Yuan and Shields claim that our data-encryption protocol is entirely equivalent to a classical stream cipher utilizing no quantum phenomena. Their claim is, indeed, false. Yuan and Shields also claim that schemes similar to the one presented in Phys. Rev. Lett. 90, 227901 are not suitable for key generation. This claim is also refuted. In any event, we welcome the opportunity to clarify the situation for a wider audience. "
"It is well known that if a group G factorizes as G = NH where H\leq G and N is normal in G then the group structure of G is determined by the subgroups H and N, the intersection of N with H and how H acts on N with a homomorphism f : H -> Aut(N). Here we generalize the idea by creating extensions using the semi-automorphism group of N. We show that if G=NH is a Moufang loop, N is a normal subloop, and H=<u> is a finite cyclic group of order coprime to three then the binary operation of G depends only on the binary operation of N, the intersection of N with H, and how u permutes the elements of N as a semi-automorphism of N. "
"Mean-field models are a popular tool in a variety of fields. They provide an understanding of the impact of interactions among a large number of particles or people or other ""self-interested agents"", and are an increasingly popular tool in distributed control. This paper considers a particular randomized distributed control architecture introduced in our own recent work. In numerical results it was found that the associated mean-field model had attractive properties for purposes of control. In particular, when viewed as an input-output system, its linearization was found to be minimum phase. In this paper we take a closer look at the control model. The results are summarized as follows: (i) The Markov Decision Process framework of Todorov is extended to continuous time models, in which the ""control cost"" is based on relative entropy. This is the basis of the construction of a family of controlled Markovian generators. (ii) A decentralized control architecture is proposed in which each agent evolves as a controlled Markov process. A central authority broadcasts a common control signal to each agent. The central authority chooses this signal based on an aggregate scalar output of the Markovian agents. (iii) Provided the control-free system is a reversible Markov process, the following identity holds for the linearization, \[ \text{Real} (G(j\omega)) = \text{PSD}_Y(\omega)\ge 0, \quad \omega\in\Re, \] where the right hand side denotes the power spectral density for the output of any one of the individual (control-free) Markov processes.

"This talk is based on my work in collaboration with B. Boisseau, D. Polarski, and A.A. Starobinsky. The most natural and best-motivated alternatives to general relativity are the so-called ""scalar-tensor"" theories, in which the gravitational interaction is mediated not only by a (spin-2) graviton, but also by a (spin-0) scalar field. We study quintessence in this general framework, and show that the microscopic Lagrangian of the theory can be unambiguously reconstructed from two observable cosmological functions of the redshift: the luminosity distance and the linear density perturbation of dustlike matter. We also analyze the constraints imposed on the theory by the knowledge of only the first of these functions, as it will probably be available sooner with a good accuracy. [The main interest of this very short paper is to give the equations in the ""Brans-Dicke"" parametrization.] "
"A predator-prey model of dual populations with stochastic oscillators is presented. A linear cross-coupling between the two populations is introduced following the coupling between the motions of a Wilberforce pendulum in two dimensions: one in the longitudinal and the other in torsional plain. Within each population a Kuramoto type competition between the phases is assumed. Thus, the synchronisation state of the whole system is controlled by these two types of competitions. The results of the numerical simulations show that by adding the linear cross-coupling interactions predator-prey oscillations between the two populations appear which results in self-regulation of the system by a transfer of synchrony between the two populations. The model represents several important features of the dynamical interplay between the drift wave and zonal flow turbulence in magnetically confined plasmas, and a novel interpretation of the coupled dynamics of drift wave-zonal flow turbulence using synchronisation of stochastic oscillator is discussed. "
"We consider a novel paradigm for Bayesian testing of hypotheses and Bayesian model comparison. Our alternative to the traditional construction of posterior probabilities that a given hypothesis is true or that the data originates from a specific model is to consider the models under comparison as components of a mixture model. We therefore replace the original testing problem with an estimation one that focus on the probability weight of a given model within a mixture model. We analyze the sensitivity on the resulting posterior distribution on the weights of various prior modeling on the weights. We stress that a major appeal in using this novel perspective is that generic improper priors are acceptable, while not putting convergence in jeopardy. Among other features, this allows for a resolution of the Lindley-Jeffreys paradox. When using a reference Beta B(a,a) prior on the mixture weights, we note that the sensitivity of the posterior estimations of the weights to the choice of a vanishes with the sample size increasing and avocate the default choice a=0.5, derived from Rousseau and Mengersen (2011). Another feature of this easily implemented alternative to the classical Bayesian solution is that the speeds of convergence of the posterior mean of the weight and of the corresponding posterior probability are quite similar. "
Given a locally convex vector space with a topology induced by Hilbert seminorms and a continuous bilinear form on it we construct a topology on its symmetric algebra such that the usual star product of exponential type becomes continuous. Many properties of the resulting locally convex algebra are explained. We compare this approach to various other discussions of convergent star products in finite and infinite dimensions. We pay special attention to the case of a Hilbert space and to nuclear spaces.
"In this paper, the dynamical heteroclinic orbit and attractor have been employed to make the late-time behaviors of the model insensitive to the initial condition and thus alleviates the fine tuning problem in cosmological dynamical system of barotropic fluid and quintessence with a double exponential potential. The late-time asymptotic behavior of the double exponential model does not always correspond to the single case. The heteroclinic orbits are the non-stationary solutions and in general they will interpolate between the critical points. Although they can not be shown analytically, yet a numerical calculation can reveal most of their properties. Varied heteroclinic orbits and attractors including tracking attractor and de Sitter attractor have been found. "
"In this review, we have studied the quasielastic production cross sections and polarization components of $\Lambda$, $\Sigma^0$ and $\Sigma^-$ hyperons induced by the weak charged currents in the antineutrino reactions on the nucleon and the nuclear targets like $^{12}$C, $^{16}$O, $^{40}$Ar and $^{208}$Pb. It is shown that the energy and the $Q^2$ dependence of the cross sections and the various polarization components can be effectively used to determine the axial vector transition form factors in the strangeness sector and test the validity of various symmetry properties of the weak hadronic currents like G-invariance, T-invariance and SU(3) symmetry. In particular, the energy and the $Q^2$ dependence of the polarization components of the hyperons is found to be sensitive enough to determine the presence of the second class current with or without T-invariance. These hyperons decay dominantly into pions giving an additional contribution to the weak pion production induced by the antineutrinos. This contribution is shown to be quantitatively significant as compared to the pion production by the $\Delta$ excitation in the nuclear targets in the sub-GeV energy region relevant for the $\bar{\nu}_\mu$ cross section measurements in the oscillation experiments. We have also included a few new results, based on our earlier works, which are in the kinematic region of the present and future (anti)neutrino experiments being done with the accelerator (anti)neutrinos at T2K, MicroBooNE, MiniBooNE, NO$\nu$A, MINER$\nu$A and DUNE, as well as for the atmospheric (anti)neutrino experiments in this energy region.

"Ferropericlase, (Mg,Fe)O is one of the most abundant minerals of the Earth's lower mantle. The high-spin (HS) to low-spin (LS) transition in the Fe2+ ions can dramatically alter the physical and chemical properties of (Mg,Fe)O in the deep mantle, thereby changing our understanding of the Earth's deep interior. To establish a fundamental understanding of the ground electronic state of iron, the electronic and magnetic states of Fe2+ in (Mg0.75,Fe0.25)O have been investigated by transmission (TMS) and synchrotron (NFS) M\""ossbauer spectroscopy at high pressures and low temperatures (down to 5 K). The results show that the ground electronic state of Fe2+ at the critical pressure Pc of the spin transition and close to T=0 is determined by a quantum critical point Pq (T = 0, Pc) where the energy difference between the HS and LS states (an energy gap for the spin fluctuation) is zero. The deviation from T=0 leads to the thermal excitation for the HS or LS state, suggesting a strong influence on the magnetic and hence the physical properties of the material. Combining these with theoretical calculations, the results indicate that the existence of the quantum critical point at zero temperature affects not only the low-temperature physical properties, but also the strong temperature/pressure-dependent properties at conditions relevant to the middle layer of the lower mantle.

"We have developed a three-dimensional (3D) spectral hydrodynamic code to study vortex dynamics in rotating, shearing, stratified systems (e.g. the atmosphere of gas giant planets, protoplanetary disks around newly forming protostars). The time-independent background state is stably stratified in the vertical direction and has a unidirectional linear shear flow aligned with one horizontal axis. Superposed on this background state is an unsteady, subsonic flow that is evolved with the Euler equations subject to the anelastic approximation to filter acoustic phenomena. A Fourier-Fourier basis in a set of quasi-Lagrangian coordinates that advect with the background shear is used for spectral expansions in the two horizontal directions. For the vertical direction, two different sets of basis functions have been implemented: (1) Chebyshev polynomials on a truncated, finite domain, and (2) rational Chebyshev functions on an infinite domain. Use of this latter set is equivalent to transforming the infinite domain to a finite one with a cotangent mapping, and using cosine and sine expansions in the mapped coordinate. The nonlinear advection terms are time integrated explicitly, whereas the Coriolis force, buoyancy terms, and pressure/enthalpy gradient are integrated semi-implicitly. We show that internal gravity waves can be damped by adding new terms to the Euler equations. The code exhibits excellent parallel performance with the Message Passing Interface (MPI). As a demonstration of the code, we simulate the merger of two 3D vortices in the midplane of a protoplanetary disk. "
"Let $(R,\m)$ and $(S,\n)$ be commutative Noetherian local rings, and let $\phi:R\to S$ be a flat local homomorphism such that $\m S = \n$ and the induced map on residue fields $R/\m \to S/\n$ is an isomorphism. Given a finitely generated $R$-module $M$, we show that $M$ has an $S$-module structure compatible with the given $R$-module structure if and only if $\Ext^i_R(S,M)=0$ for each $i\ge 1$. We say that an $S$-module $N$ is {\it extended} if there is a finitely generated $R$-module $M$ such that $N\cong S\otimes_RM$. Given a short exact sequence $0 \to N_1\to N \to N_2\to 0$ of finitely generated $S$-modules, with two of the three modules $N_1,N,N_2$ extended, we obtain conditions forcing the third module to be extended. We show that every finitely generated module over the Henselization of $R$ is a direct summand of an extended module, but that the analogous result fails for the $\m$-adic completion. "
"In this paper we evolve magnetized and unmagnetized circumbinary accretion disks around supermassive black hole binaries in the relativistic regime. We use a post-Newtonian expansion to construct an analytical spacetime and determine how the order of the post-Newtonian (PN) expansion affects the dynamics of the gas. We find very small differences in the late-time bulk dynamics of non-magnetized hydrodynamic evolutions between the two spacetimes down to separations of approximately $40GM/c^2$ where $M$ is the total mass of the binary. For smaller separations, the differences due to PN-order become comparable to differences caused by using initial data further from equilibrium. For magnetized gas, MHD stresses, which drives the accretion dynamics, tends to mask all higher order PN effects even at separations of $20GM/c^2$, leading to essentially the same observed electromagnetic luminosity. This implies that our calculations of the EM signal may be robust down to small binary separations. Our investigation is the first to demonstrate how the level of PN accuracy affects a circumbinary disk's evolution and informs us of the range in separation within which to trust the PN approximation for this kind of study. We also address the influence the initial conditions and binary separation have on simulation predictions. "
"Following recent work on the quantum Hall effect on $S^4$, we solve the Landau problem on the complex projective spaces ${\bf C}P^k$ and discuss quantum Hall states for such spaces. Unlike the case of $S^4$, a finite spatial density can be obtained with a finite number of internal states for each particle. We treat the case of ${\bf C}P^2$ in some detail considering both Abelian and nonabelian background fields. The wavefunctions are obtained and incompressibility of the Hall states is shown. The case of ${\bf C}P^3$ is related to the case of $S^4$. "
"We give a multimensional version of the p-adic heat equation, and show that its fundamental solution is the transition density of a Markov process. "
We propose a physical scheme for implementing the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm using atomic ensembles and optical devices. The scheme has inherent fault tolerance to the realistic noise and efficient scaling with the number of ensembles for some entangled states within the reach of current technology. It would be an important step toward more complex quantum computation via atomic ensembles.
"The Raman spectra of two G-bands and a radial breathing mode (RBM) of unfilled and filled single-wall semiconducting and metallic carbon nanotubes have been investigated theoretically, in the presence of electron-phonon and phonon-phonon interactions. Excitation of low frequency optical plasmons in the metallic nanotube is responsible for the peak known as the Breit-Wigner-Fano (BWF) line shape in the G-band Raman spectra. In a filled nanotube there is an additional peak due to excitation of the phonon of the filling atom or molecule. Positions, shapes and relative strengths of these Raman peaks depend on the phonon frequencies of the nanotube and that of the filling atoms, and strengths and forms of the plasmon-phonon and phonon-phonon interactions. For example, filling atoms with phonon frequency close to the RBM frequency of the nanotube may broaden and lower the RBM Raman peak to such an extent that it may become barely visible. Hybridization between the G-bands and the filling atom phonon is also strong when these two frequencies are close to each other and it has important effects on the G-band and the BWF line shapes. When the phonon frequency of the filling atom is far from the RBM and G-band frequencies, it gives rise to a separate peak with modest effects on the RBM and G-band spectra. Raman spectra of semiconducting unfilled and filled nanotubes have similar behavior as those of metallic nanotubes except that normally they have Lorentzian line shapes and do not show a BWF line shape. However, if a semiconducting nanotube is filled with donor atoms, it is predicted that the BWF type line shape may be observed near the RBM, or the G-band or the filling atom Raman peak. "
"Traditional Stueckelberg Mechanism is shown equivalent to set up a gauged U(1) chiral Lagrangian and fix special gauge. With this mechanism, the original electro-weak chiral Lagrangian is inlarged by including an extra U(1) symmetry to represent physics for $Z'$ boson. We build up complete list of electro-weak chiral Lagrangian up to order of $p^4$ including $Z'$ and higgs bosons. The most general mixing among neutral gauge bosons is diagonalized completely and the connections among these operators to triple, quartic couplings involving $Z'$ boson and to that in traditional electro-weak chiral Lagrangian are made. "
"Formal Concept Analysis (FCA) offers several tools for qualitative data analysis. One possibility is to group objects that share common attributes together and get a concept lattice that describes the data. Quite often the size of this concept lattice is very large. Many authors have investigated methods to reduce the size of this lattice. In \cite{KMBV14} the authors consider putting together some attributes to reduce the size of the attribute sets. But this reduction does not always carry over the set of concepts. They have provided some counter examples where the size of the concept lattice increases by one after putting two attributes together. Then they asked the following question: ""How many new concepts can be generated by an $\exists$-generalization on just two attributes?"" The present paper provides a family of contexts for which the size increases on more than one concept after putting solely two attributes together. "
"For mass spectra acquired from cancer patients by MALDI or SELDI techniques, automated discrimination between cancer types or stages has often been implemented by machine learnings. These techniques typically generate ""black-box"" classifiers, which are difficult to interpret biologically. We develop new and efficient signature discovery algorithms leading to interpretable signatures combining the discriminating power of explicitly selected small groups of biomarkers, identified by their m/z ratios. Our approach is based on rigorous stochastic modeling of ""homogeneous"" datasets of mass spectra by a versatile class of parameterized Markov Random Fields. We present detailed algorithms validated by precise theoretical results. We also outline the successful tests of our approach to generate efficient explicit signatures for six benchmark discrimination tasks, based on mass spectra acquired from colorectal cancer patients, as well as from ovarian cancer patients. "
"We investigate the inhomogeneous Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) and homogeneous Sarma superfluid states in alkaline-earth-like $^{173}$Yb atomic gases near an orbital Feshbach resonance at zero temperature with population imbalances in both the open and closed channels (or bands). We find that in homogeneous space by adjusting the open-channel Zeeman energy $h_o$, both the Sarma and Fulde-Ferrell superfluid states are greatly enhanced by the spin-exchange interaction while the closed-channel Zeeman energy $h_c$ remains small. In the presence of an external harmonic trap, the trapped gas features a shell structure of separated phases, where the Sarma phase leaves detectable valley structure in the columnar-integrated momentum distribution, and the Fulde-Ferrell state acquires enhanced spatial anisotropy. As both signatures can be easily detected in time-of-flight images, our findings are helpful to realize and detect the long-sought FFLO and Sarma superfluid states at the same time in experiments. "
"In support of the EPOXI mission, we have compiled the secular light curve (SLC) of comet 103P/Hartley 2, the next target of EPOXI. a) Of the order of 30 photometric parameters are measured, over 20 of them new. The turn on point of activity is -4.2 +/- 0.1 AU from the Sun, which corresponds to -400 +/- 40 d before perihelion. The total active time is TACTIVE= 1484 +/- 43 d. b) 103P is a young dwarf comet, young because it has a photometric age P-AGE(1,1) = 15 +/- 2 cy (comet years), and dwarf because its diameter is DEFFE = 1.14 +/- 0.16 km. c) The nucleus is very active, and the amplitude of the SLC is ASEC= 10.8 +/- 0.1 mag in 1997. This comet is as active as 1P/Halley, but much smaller. d) After remaining active up to aphelion, the comet spills-over its activity into the next orbit. e) Two linear laws change slope at a break point located at RBP = -1.20 +/- 0.1 AU before perihelion, and magnitude mBP = 9.4 +/- 0.1. Sublimation is not controlled by water ice. The controlling substance may be CO or CO2 ice. CO2 has been detected spectroscopically. f) The water budget of this comet is calculated. The comet expends 1.88 10^10 kg of water per apparition. A new water-budget age is defined and it is found that WB-AGE = 19 cy vs WB-AGE = 0.65 cy for 1P/Halley and 28 cy for 9P. g) The values of Af{\rho} are calculated on two dates and we find dust production rates of 106 and 37 kg/s. h) The thickness of the layer lost per apparition is calculated, and we find {\Delta}r = 39 m where r is the radius. Since the radius of this comet is r = 570 m, it is found that at the present rate the comet may disappear in only 17 revolutions (~109 y). i) All comets visited by spacecraft are young objects. 103P follows the same trend. It is expected that the surface morphology that will be found in future EPOXI images should be very similar to that of previous comets. "
"In this paper we propose a new approach to study the properties of the Partial Least Squares (PLS) estimator. This approach relies on the link between PLS and discrete orthogonal polynomials. Indeed many important PLS objects can be expressed in terms of some specific discrete orthogonal polynomials, called the residual polynomials. Based on the explicit analytical expression we have stated for these polynomials in terms of signal and noise, we provide a new framework for the study of PLS. Furthermore, we show that this new approach allows to simplify and retreive independent proofs of many classical results (proved earlier by different authors using various approaches and tools). This general and unifying approach also sheds new light on PLS and helps to gain insight on its properties. "
"Workforce Scheduling and Routing Problems (WSRP) are very common in many practical domains, and usually, have a number of objectives. Illumination algorithms such as Map-Elites (ME) have recently gained traction in application to {\em design} problems, in providing multiple diverse solutions as well as illuminating the solution space in terms of user-defined characteristics, but typically require significant computational effort to produce the solution archive. We investigate whether ME can provide an effective approach to solving WSRP, a {\em repetitive} problem in which solutions have to be produced quickly and often. The goals of the paper are two-fold. The first is to evaluate whether ME can provide solutions of competitive quality to an Evolutionary Algorithm (EA) in terms of a single objective function, and the second to examine its ability to provide a repertoire of solutions that maximise user choice. We find that very small computational budgets favour the EA in terms of quality, but ME outperforms the EA at larger budgets, provides a more diverse array of solutions, and lends insight to the end-user. "
"High-resolution ($\Delta E$=1.3 meV) inelastic X-ray scattering (IXS) in optimally doped untwinned YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ single crystals show that the dispersion of transverse acoustic phonons in the a-direction remains linear with no softening due to bending modes in the long wavelength limit, down to q=0.02. The sound velocity is found to be 2700 +/- 70 m s$^{-1}$, in excellent agreement with ultrasound measurements, and unchanged upon cooling from room temperature to 98 K. These results rule out a strong coupling between bending dynamics of the CuO$_2$ planes and charge carriers in cuprates. "
"Let $W$ be a finitely generated infinite Coxeter group, with $\Phi$ and $\Pi$ being the corresponding root system and set of simple roots respectively. It has been observed by Hohlweg et la that the projections of elements of $\Phi$ onto suitably chosen hyperplanes, called \emph{normalized roots}, are contained in the convex hull of $\Pi$ (which is a compact set), and hence the set of all normalized roots may exhibit interesting asymptotical behaviours. In this paper we investigate the topology of the limit set of the normalized roots and demonstrate a natural system of neighbourhoods around each limit point arising from a non-affine infinite dihedral reflection subgroup of $W$. "
"A quadratic line complex is a three-parameter family of lines in projective space P^3 specified by a single quadratic relation in the Plucker coordinates. Fixing a point p in P^3 and taking all lines of the complex passing through p we obtain a quadratic cone with vertex at p. This family of cones supplies P^3 with a conformal structure. With this conformal structure we associate a three-dimensional second order quasilinear wave equation. We show that any PDE arising in this way is linearly degenerate, furthermore, any linearly degenerate PDE can be obtained by this construction. This provides a classification of linearly degenerate wave equations into eleven types, labelled by Segre symbols of the associated quadratic complexes. We classify Segre types for which the associated conformal structure is conformally flat, as well as Segre types for which the corresponding PDE is integrable. "
"For a prime power $q$ and a positive integer $n$, we say a subspace $U$ of ${\mathbb{F}_q^n}$ is {\em cyclically covering} if the union of the cyclic shifts of $U$ is equal to $\mathbb{F}_q^n$. We investigate the problem of determining the minimum possible dimension of a cyclically covering subspace of $\mathbb{F}_q^n$. (This is a natural generalisation of a problem posed in 1991 by the first author.) We prove several upper and lower bounds, and for each fixed $q$, we answer the question completely for infinitely many values of $n$ (which take the form of certain geometric series). Our results imply lower bounds for a well-known conjecture of Isbell, and a generalisation theoreof, supplementing lower bounds due to Spiga. We also consider the analogous problem for general representations of groups. We use arguments from combinatorics, representation theory and finite field theory. "
"We present VLT/NACO SDI images of the very nearby star SCR 1845-6357 (hereafter SCR 1845). SCR 1845 is a recently discovered (Hambly et al. 2004) M8.5 star just 3.85 pc from the sun (Henry et al. 2006). Using the capabilities of the unique SDI device, we discovered a substellar companion to SCR 1845 at a separation of 4.5 AU (1.170''+-0.003'' on the sky) and fainter by 3.57+-0.057 mag in the 1.575 um SDI filter. This substellar companion has an H magnitude of 13.16+0.31-0.26 (absolute H magnitude of 15.30+0.31-0.26), making it likely the brightest mid-T dwarf known. The unique Simultaneous Differential Imager (SDI) consists of 3 narrowband filters placed around the 1.6 um methane absorption feature characteristic of T-dwarfs (Teff < 1200 K). The flux of the substellar companion drops by a factor of 2.7+-0.1 between the SDI F1(1.575 um) filter and the SDI F3(1.625 um) filter, consistent with strong methane absorption in a substellar companion. We estimate a spectral type of T5.5+-1 for the companion based on the strength of this methane break. The chances that this object is a background T dwarf are vanishing small -- and there is no isolated background T-dwarf in this part of the sky according to 2MASS. Thus, it is a bound companion, hereafter SCR 1845-6357B. For an age range of 100 Myr - 10 Gyr and spectral type range of T4.5-T6.5, we find a mass range of 9 - 65 MJup for SCR 1845B from the Baraffe et al. 2003 COND models. SCR 1845AB is the 24th closest stellar system to the Sun (at 3.85 pc); the only brown dwarf system closer to the Sun is Eps Indi Ba-Bb (at 3.626 pc). In addition, this is the first T-dwarf companion discovered around a low mass star. "
"We describe the technique used to develop on-orbit calibrators for IRAC and validate the method for either K0-M0III or A0-A5V stars. For SIRTF, the approach uses all available optical, NIR, and MIR photometry, and yields absolute spectra from UV to MIR. One set of stars is from Landolt's network of optical standards, the other from Carter-Meadows IR standards. Traceability to the Cohen-Walker- Witteborn framework of absolute photometry and spectra is assured. The method is based on using either ""supertemplates"" to represent the intrinsic shapes of the spectra of K0-M0IIIs from 1150A to 35 um, or Kurucz synthetic spectra for A0-5V stars. Each supertemplate/model is reddened according to a star's extinction and normalized by characterized optical photometry. This paper tests our ability to predict NIR (JHK) magnitudes from supertemplates or models constrained by Hippa- rcos/Tycho or precision ground-based optical data. We offer absolute calibrated spectra of 33 optical standards to demonstrate the viability of this technique for a set of IR calibrators 100-1000 times fainter than we have previously publ- ished. We calculate the absolute uncertainties associated with predicting IRAC mags for the faintest cool giant and hot dwarf in this new set of calibrators. "
"We consider a supersymmetric (SUSY) scenario including right-handed neutrinos, one of whose scalar superpartners is the lightest SUSY particle (LSP). The distinguishing feature in the collider signal of SUSY in such a case is not missing energy but a pair of charged tracks corresponding to the next-to- lightest SUSY particle, when it is, as in the case considered, a stau. Following up on our recent work on neutralino reconstruction in such cases, we explore the possibility of reconstructing charginos, too, through a study of transverse mass distributions in specified final states. The various steps of isolating the transverse momenta of neutrinos relevant for this are outlined, and regions of the parameter space where our procedure works are identified. "
"In this article, we discuss a couple of nonlinear Galerkin method (NLG) in finite element set up for viscoelastic fluid flow, mainly equations of motion arising in the flow of 2D Oldroyd model. We obtain improved error estimate in $L^{\infty}(\bL^2)$ norm, which is optimal in nature, for linear finite element approximation, in view of the error estimate available in literature, in $L^2(\bH^1)$ norm. "
"This study introduces a structured analysis of science parks as arenas designed to stimulate institutional collaboration and the commercialization of academic knowledge and technology, and the promotion of social welfare. A framework for key actors and their potential behaviour in this context is introduced based on the Triple Helix (TH) model and related literature. A link analysis was conducted to build an inter-linking network that may map the infrastructure support network through the online interactions of the organisations involved in York Science Park. A comparison between the framework and the diagram shows that the framework can be used to identify most of the actors and assess their interconnections. The web patterns found correspond to previous evaluations based on traditional indicators and suggest that the network, which is developed to foster and support innovation, arises from the functional cooperation between the University of York and regional authorities, which both serve as the major driving forces in the trilateral linkages and the development of an innovation infrastructure. "
"The Soft Gamma Repeater 1806-20 produced patterns of bursts during its 1983 outburst that indicate multiple independent energy accumulation sites, each driven by a continuous power source, with sudden, incomplete releases of the accumulated energy. The strengths of the power sources and their durations of activity vary over several orders of magnitude. "
"In now classic work, David Kendall (1966) recognized that the Yule process and Poisson process could be related by a (random) time change. Furthermore, he showed that the Yule population size rescaled by its mean has an almost sure exponentially distributed limit as $t\to \infty$. In this note we introduce a class of coupled delayed Yule processes parameterized by $0 < \alpha \le 1$ that includes the Poisson process at $\alpha = {1/2}$. Moreover we extend Kendall's limit theorem to include a larger class of positive martingales derived from functionals that gauge the population genealogy. A somewhat surprising connection with the Holley-Liggett smoothing transformation also emerges in this context. Specifically, the latter is exploited to uniquely characterize the moment generating functions of distributions of the limit martingales, generalizing Kendall's mean one exponential limit. "
"We introduce the notion of sofic measurable equivalence relations. Using them we prove that Connes' Embedding Conjecture as well as the Measurable Determinant Conjecture of L\""uck, Sauer and Wegner hold for treeable equivalence relations. "
"A systematic review identifies and collates various clinical studies and compares data elements and results in order to provide an evidence based answer for a particular clinical question. The process is manual and involves lot of time. A tool to automate this process is lacking. The aim of this work is to develop a framework using natural language processing and machine learning to build information extraction algorithms to identify data elements in a new primary publication, without having to go through the expensive task of manual annotation to build gold standards for each data element type. The system is developed in two stages. Initially, it uses information contained in existing systematic reviews to identify the sentences from the PDF files of the included references that contain specific data elements of interest using a modified Jaccard similarity measure. These sentences have been treated as labeled data.A Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is trained on this labeled data to extract data elements of interests from a new article. We conducted experiments on Cochrane Database systematic reviews related to congestive heart failure using inclusion criteria as an example data element. The empirical results show that the proposed system automatically identifies sentences containing the data element of interest with a high recall (93.75%) and reasonable precision (27.05% - which means the reviewers have to read only 3.7 sentences on average). The empirical results suggest that the tool is retrieving valuable information from the reference articles, even when it is time-consuming to identify them manually. Thus we hope that the tool will be useful for automatic data extraction from biomedical research publications. The future scope of this work is to generalize this information framework for all types of systematic reviews. "
"Both gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) and blazars have relativistic jets pointing at a small angle from our line of sight. Several recent studies suggested that these two kinds of sources may share similar jet physics. In this work, we explore the variability properties for GRBs and blazars as a whole. We find that the correlation between minimum variability timescale (MTS) and Lorentz factor, $\Gamma$, as found only in GRBs by Sonbas et al. can be extended to blazars with a joint correlation of $\rm MTS\propto\Gamma^{-4.7\pm0.3}$. The same applies to the $\rm MTS\propto \it L_{\gamma}^{\rm -1.0\pm0.1}$ correlation as found in GRBs, which can be well extended into blazars as well. These results provide further evidence that the jets in these two kinds of sources are similar despite of the very different mass scale of their central engines. Further investigations of the physical origin of these correlations are needed, which can shed light on the nature of the jet physics. "
"We solve the satisfiability problem for a three-sorted fragment of set theory (denoted $3LQST_0^R$), which admits a restricted form of quantification over individual and set variables and the finite enumeration operator $\{\text{-}, \text{-}, \ldots, \text{-}\}$ over individual variables, by showing that it enjoys a small model property, i.e., any satisfiable formula $\psi$ of $3LQST_0^R$ has a finite model whose size depends solely on the length of $\psi$ itself. Several set-theoretic constructs are expressible by $3LQST_0^R$-formulae, such as some variants of the power set operator and the unordered Cartesian product. In particular, concerning the unordered Cartesian product, we show that when finite enumerations are used to represent the construct, the resulting formula is exponentially shorter than the one that can be constructed without resorting to such terms. "
"As data science continues to grow in popularity, there will be an increasing need to make data science tools more scalable, flexible, and accessible. In particular, automated machine learning (AutoML) systems seek to automate the process of designing and optimizing machine learning pipelines. In this chapter, we present a genetic programming-based AutoML system called TPOT that optimizes a series of feature preprocessors and machine learning models with the goal of maximizing classification accuracy on a supervised classification problem. Further, we analyze a large database of pipelines that were previously used to solve various supervised classification problems and identify 100 short series of machine learning operations that appear the most frequently, which we call the building blocks of machine learning pipelines. We harness these building blocks to initialize TPOT with promising solutions, and find that this sensible initialization method significantly improves TPOT's performance on one benchmark at no cost of significantly degrading performance on the others. Thus, sensible initialization with machine learning pipeline building blocks shows promise for GP-based AutoML systems, and should be further refined in future work. "
"The development of selective high precision chemical functionalization strategies for device fabrication, in conjunction with associated techniques for patterning graphene wafers with atomic accuracy would provide the necessary basis for a post-CMOS manufacturing technology. This requires a thorough understanding of the principles governing the reactivity and patterning of graphene at the sub-nanometer length scale. This article reviews our quest to delineate the principles of graphene chemistry - that is, the chemistry at the Dirac point and beyond, and the effect of covalent chemistry on the electronic structure, electrical transport and magnetic properties of this low-dimensional material in order to enable the scalable production of graphene-based devices for low- and high-end technology applications. "
"Compact binaries in our galaxy are expected to be one of the main sources of gravitational waves for the future eLISA mission. During the mission lifetime, many thousands of galactic binaries should be individually resolved. However, the identification of the sources, and the extraction of the signal parameters in a noisy environment are real challenges for data analysis. So far, stochastic searches have proven to be the most successful for this problem. In this work we present the first application of a swarm-based algorithm combining Particle Swarm Optimization and Differential Evolution. These algorithms have been shown to converge faster to global solutions on complicated likelihood surfaces than other stochastic methods. We first demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm for the case of a single binary in a 1 mHz search bandwidth. This interesting problem gave the algorithm plenty of opportunity to fail, as it can be easier to find a strong noise peak rather than the signal itself. After a successful detection of a fictitious low-frequency source, as well as the verification binary RXJ0806.3+1527, we then applied the algorithm to the detection of multiple binaries, over different search bandwidths, in the cases of low and mild source confusion. In all cases, we show that we can successfully identify the sources, and recover the true parameters within a 99\% credible interval. "
"VLBI observations of supernovae and gamma-ray bursts provide almost the only way of obtaining spatially resolved information about the sources. In particular, a determination of the expansion velocity of the forward shock, as well as the geometry of the fireball and its evolution with time are possible for relatively nearby events, provided they are radio bright. Monitoring the expansion of the shock front can provide information on the density profiles of both the circumstellar material and on the ejecta. VLBI observations can also potentially resolve GRB jets which are not directed along the line of sight, providing crucial confirmation of relativistic expansion in such objects. This review gives an overview of recent results from supernovae, including the Type I b/c SNe 2011dh, 2009bb, and 2007gr, and discusses the prospects for future observations. "
"A double nanohole in a metal film was used to trap nanoparticles (20 nm diameter) and simultaneously record their Raman spectrum using the trapping laser as the excitation source. This allowed for the identification of characteristic Stokes lines for titania and polystyrene nanoparticles, showing the capability for material identification of nanoparticles once trapped. Increased Raman signal is observed for the trapping of multiple nanoparticles. This system combines the benefits of nanoparticle isolation and manipulation with unique identification. "
"This paper proves that in Size Theory the comparison of multidimensional size functions can be reduced to the 1-dimensional case by a suitable change of variables. Indeed, we show that a foliation in half-planes can be given, such that the restriction of a multidimensional size function to each of these half-planes turns out to be a classical size function in two scalar variables. This leads to the definition of a new distance between multidimensional size functions, and to the proof of their stability with respect to that distance. "
"We have reanalyzed the long-term optical light curve (LC) of the symbiotic star Z Andromedae, covering 112--yr of mostly visual observations. Two strictly periodic and one quasi-periodic cycles can be identified in this LC. A P1=7550 d quasi periodicity characterizes the repetition time of the outburst episodes of this symbiotic star. Six such events have been recorded so far. During quiescence states of the system, i.e. in time intervals between outbursts, the LC is clearly modulated by a stable coherent period of P2=759.1 d. This is the well known orbital period of the Z And binary system that have been measured also spectroscopically. A third coherent period of P3=658.4 d is modulating the intense fluctuations in the optical brightness of the system during outbursts. We attribute the trigger of the outbursts phenomenon and the clock that drives it, to a solar type magnetic dynamo cycle that operates in the convection and the outer layers of the giant star of the system. We suggest that the intense surface activity of the giant star during maximum phases of its magnetic cycle is especially enhanced in one or two antipode regions, fixed in the atmosphere of the star and rotating with it. Such spots could be active regions around the North and the South poles of a general magnetic dipole field of the star. The P3 periodicity is half the beat of the binary orbital period of the system and the spin period of the giant. The latter is then either 482 or 1790 d. If only one pole is active on the surface of the giant, P3 is the beat period itself, and the spin period is 352 d. It could also be 5000 d if the giant is rotating in retrograde direction. We briefly compare these findings in the LC of Z And to similar modulations that were identified in the LC of two other prototype symbiotics, BF Cyg and YY Her. "
"Bibliometric-enhanced Information Retrieval (BIR) workshops serve as the annual gathering of IR researchers who address various information-related tasks on scientific corpora and bibliometrics. The workshop features original approaches to search, browse, and discover value-added knowledge from scientific documents and related information networks (e.g., terms, authors, institutions, references). We welcome contributions elaborating on dedicated IR systems, as well as studies revealing original characteristics on how scientific knowledge is created, communicated, and used. In this paper we introduce the BIR workshop series and discuss some selected papers presented at previous BIR workshops. "
"The paper discusses the similarities and the differences in the mathematical theories of the steady Boltzmann and incompressible Navier-Stokes equations posed in a bounded domain. First we discuss two different scaling limits in which solutions of the steady Boltzmann equation have an asymptotic behavior described by the steady Navier-Stokes Fourier system. Whether this system includes the viscous heating term depends on the ratio of the Froude number to the Mach number of the gas flow. While the steady Navier-Stokes equations with smooth divergence-free external force always have at least one smooth solutions, the Boltzmann equation with the same external force set in the torus, or in a bounded domain with specular reflection of gas molecules at the boundary may fail to have any solution, unless the force field is identically zero. Viscous heating seems to be of key importance in this situation. The nonexistence of any steady solution of the Boltzmann equation in this context seems related to the increase of temperature for the evolution problem, a phenomenon that we have established with the help of numerical simulations on the Boltzmann equation and the BGK model.

"In this paper we present a new Bayesian network model for classification that combines the naive-Bayes (NB) classifier and the finite-mixture (FM) classifier. The resulting classifier aims at relaxing the strong assumptions on which the two component models are based, in an attempt to improve on their classification performance, both in terms of accuracy and in terms of calibration of the estimated probabilities. The proposed classifier is obtained by superimposing a finite mixture model on the set of feature variables of a naive Bayes model. We present experimental results that compare the predictive performance on real datasets of the new classifier with the predictive performance of the NB classifier and the FM classifier. "
"It has been recently shown that, under the margin (or low noise) assumption, there exist classifiers attaining fast rates of convergence of the excess Bayes risk, that is, rates faster than $n^{-1/2}$. The work on this subject has suggested the following two conjectures: (i) the best achievable fast rate is of the order $n^{-1}$, and (ii) the plug-in classifiers generally converge more slowly than the classifiers based on empirical risk minimization. We show that both conjectures are not correct. In particular, we construct plug-in classifiers that can achieve not only fast, but also super-fast rates, that is, rates faster than $n^{-1}$. We establish minimax lower bounds showing that the obtained rates cannot be improved. "
"In this paper, we investigate the extent to which knowledge compilation can be used to improve inference from propositional weighted bases. We present a general notion of compilation of a weighted base that is parametrized by any equivalence--preserving compilation function. Both negative and positive results are presented. On the one hand, complexity results are identified, showing that the inference problem from a compiled weighted base is as difficult as in the general case, when the prime implicates, Horn cover or renamable Horn cover classes are targeted. On the other hand, we show that the inference problem becomes tractable whenever DNNF-compilations are used and clausal queries are considered. Moreover, we show that the set of all preferred models of a DNNF-compilation of a weighted base can be computed in time polynomial in the output size. Finally, we sketch how our results can be used in model-based diagnosis in order to compute the most probable diagnoses of a system. "
"We show that a moving vortex lattice, as it comes to a crystal edge, radiates into a free space the harmonics of the washboard frequency, $\omega_0=2\pi v/a$, up to a superconducting gap, $\Delta/\hbar$. Here $v$ is the velocity of the vortex lattice and $a$ is the intervortex spacing. We compute radiation power and show that this effect can be used for generation of terahertz radiation and for characterization of moving vortex lattices. "
"Let $\{(X_i,Y_i)\}$ be a stationary ergodic time series with $(X,Y)$ values in the product space $\R^d\bigotimes \R .$ This study offers what is believed to be the first strongly consistent (with respect to pointwise, least-squares, and uniform distance) algorithm for inferring $m(x)=E[Y_0|X_0=x]$ under the presumption that $m(x)$ is uniformly Lipschitz continuous. Auto-regression, or forecasting, is an important special case, and as such our work extends the literature of nonparametric, nonlinear forecasting by circumventing customary mixing assumptions. The work is motivated by a time series model in stochastic finance and by perspectives of its contribution to the issues of universal time series estimation. "
"We use mid-IR to UV observations to derive a mean attenuation curve out to the rest-frame extreme ultraviolet (EUV) for ""BAL dust"" -- the dust causing the additional extinction of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) with broad absorption lines (BALQSOs). In contrast to the normal, relatively flat, mean AGN attenuation curve, BAL dust is well fit by a steeply rising, SMC-like curve. We confirm the shape of the theoretical Weingartner & Draine SMC curve out to 700 \AA, but the drop in attenuation at still shorter wavelengths is less than predicted. The identical attenuation curve for low-ionization BALQSOs (LoBALs) does not support them being a ""break out"" phase in the life of AGNs. Although attenuation in the optical due to BAL dust is low ($E(B-V) \sim 0.03 - 0.05$), the attenuation rises to one magnitude in the EUV because of the steep extinction curve. Here the dust optical depth is at the optimum value for radiative acceleration of dusty gas. Because the spectral energy distribution of AGNs peaks in the EUV where the optical depth is highest, the force on the dust dominates the acceleration of BAL gas. For LoBALs we get a negative attenuation curve in the optical. This is naturally explained if there is more light scattered into our line of sight in LoBALs compared with non-BALQSOs. We suggest that this and partial covering are causes when attenuation curves appear to be steeper in the UV that an SMC curve. "
"We examine the possibility that the gravitational contribution to the entropy of a system can be identified with some measure of the Weyl curvature. In this paper we consider homothetically self-similar spacetimes. These are believed to play an important role in describing the asymptotic properties of more general models. By exploiting their symmetry properties we are able to impose significant restrictions on measures of the Weyl curvature which could reflect the gravitational entropy of a system. In particular, we are able to show, by way of a more general relation, that the most widely used ""dimensionless"" scalar is \textit{not} a candidate for this measure along homothetic trajectories. "
"In the last years, researchers have realized the difficulties of fitting power-law distributions properly. These difficulties are higher in Zipf's systems, due to the discreteness of the variables and to the existence of two representations for these systems, i.e., two versions about which is the random variable to fit. The discreteness implies that a power law in one of the representations is not a power law in the other, and vice versa. We generate synthetic power laws in both representations and apply a state-of-the-art fitting method (based on maximum-likelihood plus a goodness-of-fit test) for each of the two random variables. It is important to stress that the method does not fit the whole distribution, but the tail, understood as the part of a distribution above a cut-off that separates non-power-law behavior from power-law behavior. We find that, no matter which random variable is power-law distributed, the rank-size representation is not adequate for fitting, whereas the representation in terms of the distribution of sizes leads to the recovery of the simulated exponents, may be with some bias. "
"A potential explanation [U.~D.~Jentschura, Phys.\ Rev.\ A {\bf 88}, 062514 (2013)] of the proton radius puzzle originating from the non-perturbative lepton-pair content of the proton is studied. Well-defined quantities that depend on this lepton-pair content are evaluated. Each is found to be of the order of $10({\alpha\over \pi})^2$, so that we find such a lepton-pair content exists in the proton. However, we argue that this relatively large result and general features of loop diagrams rule out the possibility of lepton-pair content as an explanation of the proton radius puzzle. In addition, the contributions of a class of explanations of the proton radius puzzle (for which the dependence on the $\mu p$ relative distance is as a contact interaction) is determined. "
"We prove a Tits alternative theorem for groups acting on CAT(0) cubical complexes. Namely, suppose that $G$ is a group for which there is a bound on the orders of its finite subgroups. We prove that if $G$ acts properly on a finite-dimensional CAT(0) cubical complex, then either $G$ contains a free subgroup of rank 2 or $G$ is finitely generated and virtually abelian. In particular the above conclusion holds for any group $G$ with a free action on a finite-dimensional CAT(0) cubical complex. "
"The problem of extrapolating the series in powers of small variables to the region of large variables is addressed. Such a problem is typical of quantum theory and statistical physics. A method of extrapolation is developed based on self-similar factor and root approximants, suggested earlier by the authors. It is shown that these approximants and their combinations can effectively extrapolate power series to the region of large variables, even up to infinity. Several examples from quantum and statistical mechanics are analysed, illustrating the approach. "
"In 1993, E. Lesigne proved a polynomial extension of the Wiener-Wintner ergodic theorem and asked two questions: does this result have a uniform counterpart and can an assumption of total ergodicity be replaced by ergodicity? The purpose of this article is to answer these questions, the first one positively and the second one negatively. "
"In this paper, we introduce the concept of monotone Gregus-\'Ciri\'c-contraction mappings in weighted digraphs. Then we establish a fixed point theorem for monotone Gregus-\'Ciri\'c-contraction mappings defined in convex weighted digraphs. "
"One of the major challenges providing large databases like the WFCAM Science Archive (WSA) is to minimize ingest times for pixel/image metadata and catalogue data. In this article we describe how the pipeline processed data are ingested into the database as the first stage in building a release database which will be succeeded by advanced processing (source merging, seaming, detection quality flagging etc.). To accomplish the ingestion procedure as fast as possible we use a mixed Python/C++ environment and run the required tasks in a simple parallel modus operandi where the data are split into daily chunks and then processed on different computers. The created data files can be ingested into the database immediately as they are available. This flexible way of handling the data allows the most usage of the available CPUs as the comparison with sequential processing shows. "
"We review recent progress towards the understanding of higher spin gauge symmetry breaking in AdS space from a holographic vantage point. According to the AdS/CFT correspondence, N=4 SYM theory at vanishing coupling constant should be dual to a theory in AdS which exhibits higher spin gauge symmetry enhancement. When the SYM coupling is non-zero, all but a handful of HS currents are violated by anomalies, and correspondingly local higher spin symmetry in the bulk gets spontaneously broken. In agreement with previous results and holographic expectations, we find that, barring one notable exception (spin 1 eating spin 0), the Goldstone modes responsible for HS symmetry breaking in AdS have non-vanishing mass even in the limit in which the gauge symmetry is restored. We show that spontaneous breaking a' la Stueckelberg implies that the mass of the relevant spin s'=s-1 Goldstone field is exactly the one predicted by the correspondence. "
"We report here on a sequence of 28 observations of the binary pulsar system PSR B1259-63/SS2883 at four radio frequencies made with the Australia Telescope Compact Array around the time of the 2000 periastron passage. Observations made on 2000 Sep 1 show that the pulsar's apparent rotation measure (RM) reached a maximum of $-14800 \pm 1800$ rad m$^{-2}$, some 700 times the value measured away from periastron, and is the largest astrophysical RM measured. This value, combined with the dispersion measure implies a magnetic field in the Be star's wind of 6 mG. We find that the light curve of the unpulsed emission is similar to that obtained during the 1997 periastron but that differences in detail imply that the emission disc of the Be star is thicker and/or of higher density. The behaviour of the light curve at late times is best modelled by the adiabatic expansion of a synchrotron bubble formed in the pulsar/disc interaction. The expansion rate of the bubble $\sim 12$ km s$^{-1}$ is surprisingly low but the derived magnetic field of 1.6 G close to that expected. "
"25%-50% of all white dwarfs (WDs) host observable and dynamically active remnant planetary systems based on the presence of close-in circumstellar dust and gas and photospheric metal pollution. Currently-accepted theoretical explanations for the origin of this matter include asteroids that survive the star's giant branch evolution at au-scale distances and are subsequently perturbed onto WD-grazing orbits following stellar mass loss. In this work we investigate the tidal disruption of these highly-eccentric (e > 0.98) asteroids as they approach and tidally disrupt around the WD. We analytically compute the disruption timescale and compare the result with fully self-consistent numerical simulations of rubble piles by using the N-body code PKDGRAV. We find that this timescale is highly dependent on the orbit's pericentre and largely independent of its semimajor axis. We establish that spherical asteroids readily break up and form highly eccentric collisionless rings, which do not accrete onto the WD without additional forces such as radiation or sublimation. This finding highlights the critical importance of such forces in the physics of WD planetary systems. "
"The study of the phenomenon of quantum weak turbulence is extended by determining the quasiparticle spectrum associated with such a system using a Green's function approach. The quasiparticle spectrum calculated establishes the dissipative regime and the inertial regime, hence a Kolmogorov type of picture. "
"In this paper, we propose a novel deep multi-level attention model to address inverse visual question answering. The proposed model generates regional visual and semantic features at the object level and then enhances them with the answer cue by using attention mechanisms. Two levels of multiple attentions are employed in the model, including the dual attention at the partial question encoding step and the dynamic attention at the next question word generation step. We evaluate the proposed model on the VQA V1 dataset. It demonstrates state-of-the-art performance in terms of multiple commonly used metrics. "
"We obtain a unique, canonical one-to-one correspondence between the space of marked postcritically finite Newton maps of polynomials and the space of postcritically minimal Newton maps of entire maps that take the form $p(z) \text{exp}(q(z))$ for $p(z)$, $q(z)$ polynomials and $\text{exp}(z)$, the complex exponential function. This bijection preserves the dynamics and embedding of Julia sets and is induced by a surgery tool developed by Ha\""issinsky. "
"In a recent publication, we suggested a mechanism for obtaining dynamical CP violation in the early Universe based on the out-of-equilibrium evolution of complex scalar fields. In this paper, we suggest several ways of transferring the CP asymmetry from the scalar sector to the leptonic sector. In particular, we point out how a ``transient MNS(P) matrix'' can generate an asymmetry between fermions and anti-fermions directly. "
"Let $f \in \mathbb{Z}[y]$ be a polynomial such that $f(\mathbb{N}) \subseteq \mathbb{N}$, and let $p_{\mathcal{A}_{f}}(n)$ denote number of partitions of $n$ whose parts lie in the set $\mathcal{A}_f:=\{f(n):n \in \mathbb{N}\}$. Under hypotheses on the roots of $f-f(0)$, we use the Hardy--Littlewood circle method, a polylogarithm identity, and the Matsumoto--Weng zeta function to derive asymptotic formulae for $p_{\mathcal{A}_f}(n)$ as $n$ tends to infinity. This generalises asymptotic formulae for the number of partitions into perfect $d$th powers, established by Vaughan for $d=2$, and Gafni for the case $d \geq 2$, in 2015 and 2016 respectively. "
"We construct a complete equation of state (EOS) covering a wide range of temperature, proton fraction, and baryon density for the use of astrophysical simulations. We employ the relativistic mean-field (RMF) theory to describe nuclear interactions and adopt the Thomas-Fermi approximation to describe the nonuniform nuclear matter. The uniform matter and nonuniform matter are studied consistently using the same RMF theory. "
"The performance of an adaptive optics (AO) system on a 100m diameter ground based telescope working in the visible range of the spectrum is computed using an analytical approach. The target Strehl ratio of 60% is achieved at 0.5um with a limiting magnitude of the AO guide source near R~10, at the cost of an extremely low sky coverage. To alleviate this problem, the concept of tomographic wavefront sensing in a wider field of view using either natural guide stars (NGS) or laser guide stars (LGS) is investigated. These methods use 3 or 4 reference sources and up to 3 deformable mirrors, which increase up to 8-fold the corrected field size (up to 60\arcsec at 0.5 um). Operation with multiple NGS is limited to the infrared (in the J band this approach yields a sky coverage of 50% with a Strehl ratio of 0.2). The option of open-loop wavefront correction in the visible using several bright NGS is discussed. The LGS approach involves the use of a faint (R ~22) NGS for low-order correction, which results in a sky coverage of 40% at the Galactic poles in the visible. "
"We prove a quantitative structure theorem for metrics on $\mathbf{R}^n$ that are conformal to the flat metric, have almost constant positive scalar curvature, and cannot concentrate more than one bubble. As an application of our result, we show a quantitative rate of convergence in relative entropy for a fast diffusion equation in $\mathbf{R}^n$ related to the Yamabe flow. "
We present a brief description of the ``consistent discretization'' approach to classical and quantum general relativity. We exhibit a classical simple example to illustrate the approach and summarize current classical and quantum applications. We also discuss the implications for the construction of a well defined quantum theory and in particular how to construct a quantum continuum limit.
"We present a new, high-speed technique to track the three-dimensional translation and rotation of non-spherical colloidal particles. We capture digital holograms of micrometer-scale silica rods and sub-micrometer-scale Janus particles freely diffusing in water, and then fit numerical scattering models based on the discrete dipole approximation to the measured holograms. This inverse-scattering approach allows us to extract the the position and orientation of the particles as a function of time, along with static parameters including the size, shape, and refractive index. The best-fit sizes and refractive indices of both particles agree well with expected values. The technique is able to track the center of mass of the rod to a precision of 35 nm and its orientation to a precision of 1.5$^\circ$, comparable to or better than the precision of other 3D diffusion measurements on non-spherical particles. Furthermore, the measured translational and rotational diffusion coefficients for the silica rods agree with hydrodynamic predictions for a spherocylinder to within 0.3%. We also show that although the Janus particles have only weak optical asymmetry, the technique can track their 2D translation and azimuthal rotation over a depth of field of several micrometers, yielding independent measurements of the effective hydrodynamic radius that agree to within 0.2%. The internal and external consistency of these measurements validate the technique. Because the discrete dipole approximation can model scattering from arbitrarily shaped particles, our technique could be used in a range of applications, including particle tracking, microrheology, and fundamental studies of colloidal self-assembly or microbial motion. "
"We construct an electromagnetic field whose scalar potential is a pulsed-beam wavelet Psi (an analytic continuation of a classical Huygens wavelet). The vector potential A is determined up to three complex parameters by requiring that (a) it satisfies the Lorenz gauge condition with Psi, (b) its current density is supported on the same disk D as the charge density of Psi, (c) it is axisymmetric, and (d) it has the same retarded time dependence as Psi. By choosing one of the parameters in A appropriately, the electromagnetic field generated by the four-potential (A, Psi) can be made null, meaning that E^2=B^2 and E dot B=0. We call such fields coherent because upon being radiated, they do not loiter around the source, generating electromagnetic inertia (a new concept related to reactive energy) but immediately propagate out at the speed of light. The coherent EM wavelets define a twisting null congruence of light rays in Minkowski space, which we show to be identical to the Kerr congruence associated with the Kerr-Newman metric. The latter represents a black hole due to a time-independent charge-current density on a massive disk D spinning at the angular velocity c/a, where a is the radius of D. By contrast, our coherent wavelets are electromagnetic pulsed beams radiated by pulsed charge-current distributions on D, still spinning at the uniform rate c/a. "
"This note records a curious numerical identity: the number 1318, connected with Vandermonde's cyclotomic quintic, may be decomposed in two distinct ways as a sum of products of pairs of numbers taken from the set \{$6, 16, 26, 41$\}, namely $1318 = 6\cdot41 + 16\cdot26 + 16\cdot41 = 6\cdot16 + 6\cdot26 + 26\cdot41$. Based on the existence of radical solutions of certain families of Abelian and generalized Abelian equations, we conjecture the existence of an infinite number of analogous decompositions, involving arbitrarily large sets of numbers. "
We study pullback from a topological viewpoint with emphasis on pullback of covering maps. We generalize a triad of Quillen on properties of the pullback functor.
The recent theoretical progress in the description of semileptonic decays in the framework of the heavy mass expansion is summarized. Both inclusive and exclusive decays are considered.
"If V and W are varieties of algebras such that any V-algebra A has a reduct U(A) in W, there is a forgetful functor U: V->W that acts by A |-> U(A) on objects, and identically on homomorphisms. This functor U always has a left adjoint F: W->V by general considerations. One calls F(B) the V-algebra freely generated by the W-algebra B. Two problems arise naturally in this broad setting. The description problem is to describe the structure of the V-algebra F(B) as explicitly as possible in terms of the structure of the W-algebra B. The recognition problem is to find conditions on the structure of a given V-algebra A that are necessary and sufficient for the existence of a W-algebra B such that F(B) is isomorphic to A. Building on and extending previous work on MV-algebras freely generated by finite distributive lattices, in this paper we provide solutions to the description and recognition problems in case V is the variety of MV-algebras, W is the variety of Kleene algebras, and B is finitely generated--equivalently, finite. The proofs rely heavily on the Davey-Werner natural duality for Kleene algebras, on the representation of finitely presented MV-algebras by compact rational polyhedra, and on the theory of bases of MV-algebras.

Let C be an arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay curve of arithmetic genus 4. We prove that the family of such curves of degree 8 in $P^4_k$ is irreducible.
"We study the behaviour of Dirac current in expanding spacetime with Schr{\""o}dinger and de Sitter form for the evolution of the scale-factor. The study is made to understand the particle-antiparticle rotation and the evolution of quantum vacuum leading to particle production in such spacetime. "
"Interest in non-standard recombination scenarios has been spurred by recent cosmic microwave background (CMB) results from BOOMERANG and MAXIMA, which show an unexpectedly low second acoustic peak, resulting in a best-fit baryon density that is 50% larger than the prediction of big-bang nucleosynthesis (BBN). This apparent discrepancy can be avoided if the universe has a non-standard ionization history in which the recombination of hydrogen is significantly delayed relative to the standard model. While future CMB observations may eliminate this discrepancy, it is useful to develop a general framework for analyzing non-standard ionization histories. We develop such a framework, examining non-standard models in which the hydrogen binding energy E_b and the overall expression for the time rate of change of the ionized fraction of electrons are multiplied by arbitrary factors. This set of models includes a number of previously-proposed models as special cases. We find a wide range of models with delayed recombination that are able to fit the CMB data with a baryon density in accordance with BBN, but there are even allowed models with earlier recombination than in the standard model. A generic prediction of these models is that the third acoustic CMB peak should be very low relative to what is found in the standard model. This is the case even for the models with earlier recombination than in the standard model, because here the third peak is lowered by an increased diffusion damping at recombination relative to the standard model. Interestingly, the specific height of the third peak depends sensitively on the model parameters, so that future CMB measurements will be able to distinguish between different non-standard recombination scenarios. "
"Recently there has been a lot of interest around the world in the use of nuclear reactors to measure theta 13, the last undetermined angle in the 3-neutrino mixing scenario. In this paper the motivations for theta 13 measurement using short baseline nuclear reactor experiments are discussed. The features of such an experiment are described in the context of Double Chooz, which is a new project planned to start data-taking in 2008, and to reach a sensitivity of sinsq(2 theta 13) < 0.03. "
"In this paper a pipelined architecture of a high speed network security processor (NSP) for SSL,TLS protocol is implemented on a system on chip (SOC) where hardware information of all encryption, hashing and key exchange algorithms are stored in flash memory in terms of bit files, in contrary to related works where all are actually implemented in hardware. The NSP finds applications in e-commerce, virtual private network (VPN) and in other fields that require data confidentiality. The motivation of the present work is to dynamically execute applications with stipulated throughput within budgeted hardware resource and power. A preferential algorithm choosing an appropriate cipher suite is proposed, which is based on Efficient System Index (ESI) budget comprising of power, throughput and resource given by the user. The bit files of the chosen security algorithms are downloaded from the flash memory to the partial region of field programmable gate array (FPGA). The proposed SOC controls data communication between an application running in a system through a PCI and the Ethernet interface of a network. Partial configuration feature is used in ISE14.4 suite with ZYNQ 7z020-clg484 FPGA platform. The performances "
"A fast algorithm for Antoine and Vandergheynst's (1998) directional continuous spherical wavelet transform (CSWT) is presented. Computational requirements are reduced by a factor of O(\sqrt{N}), when N is the number of pixels on the sphere. The spherical Mexican hat wavelet Gaussianity analysis of the WMAP 1-year data performed by Vielva et al. (2003) is reproduced and confirmed using the fast CSWT. The proposed extension to directional analysis is inherently afforded by the fast CSWT algorithm. "
"(Abridged) We report results of three dimensional MHD simulations of global accretion disks threaded with weak vertical magnetic fields. We perform the simulations in the spherical coordinates with different temperature profiles and accordingly different rotation profiles. In the cases with a spatially constant temperature, because the rotation frequency is vertically constant in the equilibrium condition, general properties of the turbulence are quantitatively similar to those obtained in local shearing box simulations. On the other hand, in the cases with a radially variable temperature profile, the vertical differential rotation, which is inevitable in the equilibrium condition, winds up the magnetic field lines, in addition to the usual radial differential rotation. As a result, the coherent wound magnetic fields contribute to the Maxwell stress in the surface regions. We obtain nondimensional density and velocity fluctuations ~0.1-0.2 at the midplane. The azimuthal power spectra of the magnetic fields show shallow slopes, ~m^0- m^{-1}, than those of velocity and density. We observe intermittent and structured disk winds driven by the Poynting flux associated with the MHD turbulence. The Poynting flux originating from magnetic tension is injected from the regions above a scale height towards both the midplane and the surfaces. Related to this, sound waves are directed to the midplane from the surface regions. The mass accretion mainly occurs near the surfaces and the gas near the midplane slowly moves outward, which causes large-scale meridional circulations. The vertical magnetic fields are also dragged inward in the surface regions, while they stochastically move outward and inward around the midplane. We also discuss an observational implication of induced spiral structure in the simulated turbulent disks to protoplanetary disks. "
"We report on experiments that consist in deforming a collection of monodisperse droplets produced by a microfluidic chip through a flow-focusing device. We show that a proper numerical modelling of the flow is necessary to access the stress applied by the latter on the droplet along its trajectory through the chip. This crucial step enables the full integration of the differential equation governing the dynamical deformation, and consequently the robust measurement of the interfacial tension by fitting the experiments with the calculated deformation. Our study thus demonstrates the feasibility of quantitative in-situ rheology in microfluidic flows involving e.g. droplets, capsules or cells. "
"Let $\Gamma$ be a discrete icc subgroup of PSL(2,R) of infinite covolume. and let M denote the quotient of the unit disc by $\Gamma$. We prove that a Toeplitz operator with $\Gamma$-invariant symbol f in C(M) is Brauer Fredholm if its symbol is invertible on the boundary of M and its Brauer index is equal to the winding number of f at the boundary. We construct the associated extension of the algebra of functions continuous on the boundary of M by the Brauer ideal in the C*-algebra generated by such operators. "
"In this paper, we develop a method for obtaining the approximate solution for the evolution of single-step transformations under non-isothermal conditions. We have applied it to many reaction models and obtained very simple analytical expressions for the shape of the corresponding transformation rate peaks. These analytical solutions represent a significant simplification of the system's description allowing easy curve fitting to experiment. A remarkable property is that the evolutions of the transformed fraction obtained at different heating rates are identical when time is scaled by a time constant. The accuracy achieved with our method is checked against several reaction models and different temperature dependencies of the transformation rate constant. It is shown that its accuracy is closely related with that of the Kissinger method. "
"The NA60 experiment has studied J/psi production in p-A collisions at 158 and 400 GeV, at the CERN SPS. Nuclear effects on the J/psi yield have been estimated from the A-dependence of the production cross section ratios sigma_{J/psi}^{A}/sigma_{J/psi}^{Be} (A=Al, Cu, In, W, Pb, U). We observe a significant nuclear suppression of the J/psi yield per nucleon-nucleon collision, with a larger effect at lower incident energy, and we compare this result with previous observations by other fixed-target experiments. An attempt to disentangle the different contributions to the observed suppression has been carried out by studying the dependence of nuclear effects on x_2, the fraction of nucleon momentum carried by the interacting parton in the target nucleus.

"Synthetic lipid membranes can display channel-like ion conduction events even in the absence of proteins. We show here that these events are voltage-gated with a quadratic voltage dependence as expected from electrostatic theory of capacitors. To this end, we recorded channel traces and current histograms in patch-experiments on lipid membranes. We derived a theoretical current-voltage relationship for pores in lipid membranes that describes the experimental data very well when assuming an asymmetric membrane. We determined the equilibrium constant between closed and open state and the open probability as a function of voltage. The voltage-dependence of the lipid pores is found comparable to that of protein channels. Lifetime distributions of open and closed events indicate that the channel open distribution does not follow exponential statistics but rather power law behavior for long open times. "
We consider the SU(2) lattice gauge model and investigate numerically the continuum limit of the simple center vortices which are singular configurations of the gauge fields. We found that the vortices remain alive in the continuum theory. Also we investigate the Creutz ratio and found that for all $\beta$ it vanishes for those field configurations which do not contain the simple center vortices inside the considered Wilson loop. It leads us to the conclusion that these singular field configurations play a real role in the continuum theory.
"Image-to-image (i2i) translation is the dense regression problem of learning how to transform an input image into an output using aligned image pairs. Remarkable progress has been made in i2i translation with the advent of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (DCNNs) and particular using the learning paradigm of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). In the absence of paired images, i2i translation is tackled with one or multiple domain transformations (i.e., CycleGAN, StarGAN etc.). In this paper, we study a new problem, that of image-to-image translation, under a set of continuous parameters that correspond to a model describing a physical process. In particular, we propose the SliderGAN which transforms an input face image into a new one according to the continuous values of a statistical blendshape model of facial motion. We show that it is possible to edit a facial image according to expression and speech blendshapes, using sliders that control the continuous values of the blendshape model. This provides much more flexibility in various tasks, including but not limited to face editing, expression transfer and face neutralisation, comparing to models based on discrete expressions or action units. "
We give a formal account of B\'enabou's theorem for peudoadjunctions in the context of Gray-categories. We prove that to give a pseudoadjunction $F \dashv U: A \to X$ with unit $\eta$ in a Gray-category K is precisely to give an absolute left (Kan) pseudoextension $U$ of $1_X$ along $F$ witnessed by $\eta$.
"We show that Massive Black Holes of AGNs follow the same approximately linear relation with the luminosity of the host spheroid (bulge) found in normal (quiescent) galaxies, with the black hole mass being ~0.002 that of the bulge. We also demonstrate that Narrow line AGNs seem to have a significantly lower Mbh/Lbulge ratio, which implies a new strong correlation between Mbh/Lbulge and the width of the broad emission lines of AGNs. Combining existing data, new observations and extrapolation schemes based on the Faber-Jackson relation, the relation between the BH mass and the stellar velocity dispersion in the host bulge of AGNs is constructed. It too agrees with the relation found in quiescent galaxies. "
"The magnetic fields generated by spins and currents provide a unique window into the physics of correlated-electron materials and devices. Proposed only a decade ago, magnetometry based on the electron spin of nitrogen-vacancy (NV) defects in diamond is emerging as a platform that is excellently suited for probing condensed matter systems: it can be operated from cryogenic temperatures to above room temperature, has a dynamic range spanning from DC to GHz, and allows sensor-sample distances as small as a few nanometres. As such, NV magnetometry provides access to static and dynamic magnetic and electronic phenomena with nanoscale spatial resolution. Pioneering work focused on proof-of-principle demonstrations of its nanoscale imaging resolution and magnetic field sensitivity. Now, experiments are starting to probe the correlated-electron physics of magnets and superconductors and to explore the current distributions in low-dimensional materials. In this Review, we discuss the application of NV magnetometry to the exploration of condensed matter physics, focusing on its use to study static and dynamic magnetic textures, and static and dynamic current distributions.

"Throughout 2017, the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) observed the northern far-ultraviolet aurorae of Saturn at northern solstice, during the Cassini Grand Finale. These conditions provided a complete viewing of the northern auroral region from Earth and a maximal solar illumination, expected to maximize the ionosphere-magnetosphere coupling. In this study, we analyze 24 HST images concurrently with Cassini measurements of Saturn's Kilometric Radiation and solar wind parameters predicted by two MHD models. The aurorae reveal highly variable components, down to timescales of minutes, radiating 7 to 124 +/-11 GW. They include a nightside-shifted main oval, unexpectedly frequent and bright cusp emissions and a dayside low latitude oval. On average, these emissions display a strong Local Time dependence with two maxima at dawn and pre-midnight, the latter being newly observed and attributed to nightside injections possibly associated with solstice conditions. These results provide a reference frame to analyze Cassini in situ measurements, whether simultaneous or not. "
"We present an improved algorithm for the computation of Zariski chambers on algebraic surfaces. The new algorithm significantly outperforms the so far available method and allows therefore to treat surfaces of high Picard number, where huge chamber numbers occur. As an application, we efficiently compute the number of chambers supported by the lines on the Segre-Schur quartic. "
Lyapunov's second theorem is an essential tool for stability analysis of differential equations. The paper provides an analog theorem for incremental stability analysis by lifting the Lyapunov function to the tangent bundle. The Lyapunov function endows the state-space with a Finsler structure. Incremental stability is inferred from infinitesimal contraction of the Finsler metrics through integration along solutions curves.
"This paper presents a heuristic method that uses information in the Japanese text along with knowledge of English countability and number stored in transfer dictionaries to determine the countability and number of English noun phrases. Incorporating this method into the machine translation system ALT-J/E, helped to raise the percentage of noun phrases generated with correct use of articles and number from 65% to 73%. "
"Knowledge Distillation (KD) aims to transfer knowledge in a teacher-student framework, by providing the predictions of the teacher network to the student network in the training stage to help the student network generalize better. It can use either a teacher with high capacity or {an} ensemble of multiple teachers. However, the latter is not convenient when one wants to use feature-map-based distillation methods. For a solution, this paper proposes a versatile and powerful training algorithm named FEature-level Ensemble for knowledge Distillation (FEED), which aims to transfer the ensemble knowledge using multiple teacher networks. We introduce a couple of training algorithms that transfer ensemble knowledge to the student at the feature map level. Among the feature-map-based distillation methods, using several non-linear transformations in parallel for transferring the knowledge of the multiple teacher{s} helps the student find more generalized solutions. We name this method as parallel FEED, andexperimental results on CIFAR-100 and ImageNet show that our method has clear performance enhancements, without introducing any additional parameters or computations at test time. We also show the experimental results of sequentially feeding teacher's information to the student, hence the name sequential FEED, and discuss the lessons obtained. Additionally, the empirical results on measuring the reconstruction errors at the feature map give hints for the enhancements. "
"The enumeration of normal surfaces is a key bottleneck in computational three-dimensional topology. The underlying procedure is the enumeration of admissible vertices of a high-dimensional polytope, where admissibility is a powerful but non-linear and non-convex constraint. The main results of this paper are significant improvements upon the best known asymptotic bounds on the number of admissible vertices, using polytopes in both the standard normal surface coordinate system and the streamlined quadrilateral coordinate system. To achieve these results we examine the layout of admissible points within these polytopes. We show that these points correspond to well-behaved substructures of the face lattice, and we study properties of the corresponding ""admissible faces"". Key lemmata include upper bounds on the number of maximal admissible faces of each dimension, and a bijection between the maximal admissible faces in the two coordinate systems mentioned above. "
"We study a hypercyclicity property of linear dynamical systems: a bounded linear operator T acting on a separable infinite-dimensional Banach space X is said to be hypercyclic if there exists a vector x in X such that {T^{n}x : n>0} is dense in X, and frequently hypercyclic if there exists x in X such that for any non empty open subset U of X, the set {n>0 ; T^n x \in U} has positive lower density. We prove that if T is a bounded operator on X which has ""sufficiently many"" eigenvectors associated to eigenvalues of modulus 1 in the sense that these eigenvectors are perfectly spanning, then T is automatically frequently hypercyclic. "
"We discuss a spacetime having the topology of $S^{3}\times\mathbb{R}$ but with a different smoothness structure. The initial state of the cosmos in our model is identified with a wildly embedded 3-sphere (or a fractal space). In previous work we showed that a wild embedding is obtained by a quantization of a usual (or tame) embedding. Then a wild embedding can be identified with a (geometrical) quantum state. During a decoherence process this wild 3-sphere is changed to a homology 3-sphere. We are able to calculate the decoherence time for this process. After the formation of the homology 3-sphere, we obtain a spacetime with an accelerated expansion enforced by a cosmological constant. The calculation of this cosmological constant gives a qualitative agreement with the current measured value. "
"We discuss existence and classification of totally umbilic surfaces in the model geometries of Thurston and the Berger spheres. We classify such surfaces in $H^2 \times R$, $S^2 \times R$ and the Sol group. We prove nonexistence in the Berger spheres and in the remaining model geometries other than the space forms. "
"Since the discovery of superconductivity at 26 K in oxy-pnictide LaFeAsO1-xFx, enormous interests have been stimulated in the field of condensed matter physics and material sciences. Among the many kind of structures in the iron pnictide superconductors, FeSe with the PbO structure has received special attention since there is not poisonous pnictogen element in chemical composition and its structure is the simplest one. However, the superconducting transition temperature (Tc) in iron chalcogenide compounds is not enhanced as high as other iron pnictide superconductors under ambient pressure until the superconductivity at above 30 K in potassium intercalated iron selenide KxFe2-ySe2 was discovered. The insulating and the superconducting state are both observed in KxFe2-ySe2 with different stoichiometries and some groups have tuned the system from insulating to superconducting state by varying the ratio of starting materials[10, 11]. The recent data from neutron scattering suggest that the superconductivity may be built upon an ordered state of Fe vacancies as well as the antiferromagnetic state with a very strong ordered magnetic moment 3.4 B. Here we show that the superconductivity can actually be tuned on a single sample directly from an insulating state by post-annealing and fast quenching. Upon waiting for some days at room temperatures, the superconductivity will disappear and the resistivity exhibits an insulating behavior again. The spatial distribution of the compositions of the as-grown sample and the post-annealed-quenched one was analyzed by the Energy Dispersive X-ray Spectrum (EDXS) and found to be very close to each other. Therefore it is tempting to conclude that the superconductivity is achieved when the Fe-vacancies are in a random (disordered) state. Once they arrange in an ordered state by relaxation or slow cooling, the system turns out to be an insulator. "
"WZ Sge-type dwarf novae are characterized by long recurrence times of outbursts (~10 yr) and short orbital periods (<~ 85 min). A significant part of WZ Sge stars may remain undiscovered because of low outburst activity. Recently, the observed orbital period distribution of cataclysmic variables (CVs) has changed partly because outbursts of new WZ Sge stars have been discovered routinely. Hence, the estimation of the intrinsic population of WZ Sge stars is important for the study of the population and evolution of CVs. In this paper, we present a Bayesian approach to estimate the intrinsic period distribution of dwarf novae from observed samples. In this Bayesian model, we assumed a simple relationship between the recurrence time and the orbital period which is consistent with observations of WZ Sge stars and other dwarf novae. As a result, the minimum orbital period was estimated to be ~70 min. The population of WZ Sge stars exhibited a spike-like feature at the shortest period regime in the orbital period distribution. These features are consistent with the orbital period distribution previously predicted by population synthesis studies. We propose that WZ Sge stars and CVs with a low mass-transfer rate are excellent candidates for the missing population predicted by the evolution theory of CVs. "
"We consider the scattering matrix approach to quantum electron transport in meso- and nano-conductors. This approach is an alternative to the more conventional kinetic equation and Green's function approaches, and often is more efficient for coherent conductors (especially for proving general relations) and typically more transparent. We provide a description of both time-averaged quantities (for example, current-voltage characteristics) and current fluctuations in time -- noise, as well as full counting statistics of charge transport in a finite time. In addition to normal conductors, we consider contacts with superconductors and Josephson junctions. "
"A method to simulate orthotropic behaviour in thin shell finite elements is proposed. The approach is based on the transformation of shape function derivatives, resulting in a new orthogonal basis aligned to a specified preferred direction for all elements. This transformation is carried out solely in the undeformed state leaving minimal additional impact on the computational effort expended to simulate orthotropic materials compared to isotropic, resulting in a straightforward and highly efficient implementation. This method is implemented for rotation-free triangular shells using the finite element framework built on the Kirchhoff--Love theory employing subdivision surfaces. The accuracy of this approach is demonstrated using the deformation of a pinched hemispherical shell (with a 18{\deg} hole) standard benchmark. To showcase the efficiency of this implementation, the wrinkling of orthotropic sheets under shear displacement is analyzed. It is found that orthotropic subdivision shells are able to capture the wrinkling behavior of sheets accurately for coarse meshes without the use of an additional wrinkling model. "
"We propose a novel algorithm for testing the hypothesis of nonstationarity in complex-valued signals. The implementation uses both the bootstrap and the Fast Fourier Transform such that the algorithm can be efficiently implemented in O(NlogN) time, where N is the length of the observed signal. The test procedure examines the second-order structure and contrasts the observed power variance - i.e. the variability of the instantaneous variance over time - with the expected characteristics of stationary signals generated via the bootstrap method. Our algorithmic procedure is capable of learning different types of nonstationarity, such as jumps or strong sinusoidal components. We illustrate the utility of our test and algorithm through application to turbulent flow data from fluid dynamics. "
"We investigate system-environment correlations based on the exact dynamics of a qubit and its environment in the framework of pure decoherence (phase damping). We focus on the relation of decoherence and the build-up of system-reservoir entanglement for an arbitrary (possibly mixed) initial qubit state. In the commonly employed regime where the qubit dynamics can be described by a Markov master equation of Lindblad type, we find that for almost all qubit initial states inside the Bloch sphere, decoherence is complete while the total state is still separable - no entanglement is involved. In general, both ""separable"" and ""entangling"" decoherence occurs, depending on temperature and initial qubit state. Moreover, we find situations where classical and quantum correlations periodically alternate as a function of time in the regime of low temperatures. "
"The method of solving of nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation is considered. Some examples of its applications are demonstrated. "
"We prove that the obstruction bundle used to define the cup-product in Chen-Ruan cohomology is determined by the so-called `age grading' or `degree-shifting numbers'. Indeed, the obstruction bundle can be directly computed using the age grading. We obtain a Kunneth Theorem for Chen-Ruan cohomology as a direct consequence of an elementary property of the age grading, and explain how several other results - including associativity of the cup-product - can be proved in a similar way. "
"Segmentation of the airway tree from chest computed tomography (CT) images is critical for quantitative assessment of airway diseases including bronchiectasis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). However, obtaining an accurate segmentation of airways from CT scans is difficult due to the high complexity of airway structures. Recently, deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have become the state-of-the-art for many segmentation tasks, and in particular the so-called Unet architecture for biomedical images. However, its application to the segmentation of airways still remains a challenging task. This work presents a simple but robust approach based on a 3D Unet to perform segmentation of airways from chest CTs. The method is trained on a dataset composed of 12 CTs, and tested on another 6 CTs. We evaluate the influence of different loss functions and data augmentation techniques, and reach an average dice coefficient of 0.8 between the ground-truth and our automated segmentations. "
"We propose a new experiment for decay pion spectroscopy of light hypernuclei at electron- and proton-beam facilities, using the recoil distance technique for separation of produced hypernuclei and a magnetic spectrometer for precise measurement of the decay pion momentum. Low-pressure MWPCs are advocated for low-energy recoil detection as they provide position and time information and are highly insensitive to gamma-ray and electron background. The position and timing characteristics of such a recoil detector were studied using ~5 MeV {\alpha}-particles. By using the present proposed approach the rate of the detected hypernuclei can be increased by one-to-two orders of magnitude compared to a recent experiment carried out at the MAMI electron accelerator in Mainz. The possibility of realizing a high luminosity decay pion spectroscopy experiment with proton beams is also discussed. "
"The ecological principle of limiting similarity dictates that species similar in resource requirements will compete, with the superior eventually excluding the inferior competitor from the community. The observation that nonetheless apparently similar species comprise a significant proportion of the diversity in any given community has led to suggestions that competition may not in fact be an important regulator of community structure and assembly. Here we apply a recently introduced metric of species interaction, fractional (relative) abundance, to tree species of the tropical wet forest of Barro Colorado Island, Panam\'a, the particular community that inspired the original model of non-niche or 'neutral' community dynamics9. We show a distribution of fractional abundances between pairs of most closely related congeneric tree species differing from that expected of competitive exclusion, but also inconsistent with expectations of simple similarity, whether such species interchangeability (a fundamental requirement of neutrality) is inferred at the community or the pair level. Similar evidence from a strikingly different dry forest has been linked to the focused, stable competition of a temporal niche dynamic. Taken together with these earlier findings, the results reported here establish a potentially widespread and important role for species interaction in the diversity and maintenance of natural communities that must be considered when inferring process from pattern. "
"A review of the current status of the Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa matrix (CKM) is presented. This paper is an update of the results published in [1]. The experimental constraints imposed by the measurements of \epsilon_K, V_{ub}/V_{cb}, \Delta m_d and from the limit on \Delta m_d are used. Values of the constraints and of the parameters entering into the constraints, which restrict the range of the \bar{\rho} and \bar{\eta} parameters, include recent measurements presented at 1998 Summer Conferences and progress obtained by lattice QCD collaborations. The results are: \bar{\rho}=0.202 ^{+0.053}_{-0.059},\bar{\eta}=0.340 \pm 0.035, from which the angles \alpha, \beta and \gamma of the unitarity triangle are inferred : \sin 2 \alpha = -0.26 ^{+ 0.29}_{-0.28} ,\sin 2 \beta = 0.725 ^{+0.050}_{-0.060} ,\gamma= (59.5^{+8.5}_{-7.5})^{\circ}. Without using the constraint from \epsilon_K, \sin 2 \beta has been obtained: \sin 2 \beta = 0.72 ^{+0.07}_{-0.11}. Several external measurements or theoretical inputs have been removed, in turn, from the constraints and their respective probability density functions have been obtained. Central values and uncertainties on these quantities have been compared with actual measurements or theoretical evaluations. In this way it is possible to quantify the importance of the different measurements and the coherence of the Standard Model scenario for CP violation. An important result is that \Delta m_s is expected to be between [12.0-17.6] ps^{-1} with 68% C.L. and <20 ps^{-1} at 95% C.L. Finally relations between the CKM parameters and the quark masses are examined within a given model. "
"We first propose a generalization of the notion of Mathieu subspaces of associative algebras $\mathcal A$, which was introduced recently in [Z4] and [Z6], to $\mathcal A$-modules $\mathcal M$. The newly introduced notion in a certain sense also generalizes the notion of submodules. Related with this new notion, we also introduce the sets $\sigma(N)$ and $\tau(N)$ of stable elements and quasi-stable elements, respectively, for all $R$-subspaces $N$ of $\mathcal A$-modules $\mathcal M$, where $R$ is the base ring of $\mathcal A$. We then prove some general properties of the sets $\sigma(N)$ and $\tau(N)$. Furthermore, examples from certain modules of the quasi-stable algebras [Z6], matrix algebras over fields and polynomial algebras are also studied. "
"Recent work of Biedermann and R\""ondigs has translated Goodwillie's calculus of functors into the language of model categories. Their work focuses on symmetric multilinear functors and the derivative appears only briefly. In this paper we focus on understanding the derivative as a right Quillen functor to a new model category. This is directly analogous to the behaviour of Weiss's derivative in orthogonal calculus. The immediate advantage of this new category is that we obtain a streamlined and more informative proof that the n-homogeneous functors are classified by spectra with an action of the symmetric group on n objects. In a later paper we will use this new model category to give a formal comparison between the orthogonal calculus and Goodwillie's calculus of functors. "
"The self-assembly of nanocrystals enables new classes of materials whose properties are controlled by the periodicities of the assembly, as well as by the size, shape and composition of the nanocrystals. While self-assembly of spherical nanoparticles has advanced significantly in the last decade, assembly of rod-shaped nanocrystals has seen limited progress due to the requirement of orientational order. Here, the parameters critically relevant to self-assembly are systematically quantified using a combination of diffraction and theoretical modeling; these highlight the importance of kinetics on orientational order. Through drying-mediated self-assembly we achieve unprecedented control over orientational order (up to 96% vertically oriented rods on 1cm2 areas) on a wide range of substrates (ITO, PEDOT:PSS, Si3N4). This opens new avenues for nanocrystal-based devices competitive with thin film devices, as problems of granularity can be tackled through crystallographic orientational control over macroscopic areas. "
"Motivated mainly by the localization over an open bounded set $\Omega$ of $\mathbb R^n$ of solutions of the Schr\""odinger equations, we consider the Schr\""odinger equation over $\Omega$ with a very singular potential $V(x) \ge C d (x, \partial \Omega)^{-r}$ with $r\ge 2$ and a convective flow $\vec U$. We prove the existence and uniqueness of a very weak solution of the equation, when the right hand side datum $f(x)$ is in $L^1 (\Omega, d(\cdot, \partial \Omega))$, even if no boundary condition is a priori prescribed. We prove that, in fact, the solution necessarily satisfies (in a suitable way) the Dirichlet condition $u = 0$ on $\partial \Omega$. These results improve some of the results of the previous paper by the authors in collaboration with Roger Temam. In addition, we prove some new results dealing with the $m$-accretivity in $L^1 (\Omega, d(\cdot, \partial \Omega)^ \alpha)$, where $\alpha \in [0,1]$, of the associated operator, the corresponding parabolic problem and the study of the complex evolution Schr\""odinger equation in $\mathbb R^n$. "
"Strong co-operative interactions occur between four different broken symmetries involving charge-ordering and bond distortions in the quarter-filled correlated zigzag electron ladder. The ground state is singlet, with spin gap several times larger than in the spin-Peierls state of the one-dimensional quarter-filled chain with the same parameters. We propose the quarter-filled zigzag electron ladder model for several different organic charge-transfer solids with coupled pairs of quasi-one-dimensional stacks, the spin-gap transition temperatures in which are unusually high. "
We show that the standard SU(n)-covariant Poisson sphere $S^{2n-1}$ is embedded in the nonstandard $SU(n+1)$-covariant Poisson complex projective spaces $CP^{n}$.
"The origin of the highest energy cosmic rays is still unknown. At present, the major uncertainties are located at energies above $\sim 10^{19.5}$ eV, the expected beginning of the GZK suppression. This is mainly due to the low statistics available, a problem that will be addressed in unprecedented way by the upcoming orbital detectors like JEM-EUSO. The detection of very high energy photons is of great relevance for the understanding of the origin of this extreme energy cosmic rays (EECR), due to the astrophysical information content. However, their discrimination is an experimental challenge for current and future cosmic ray detectors. In this work we study the statistical separation between hadron and photon showers from space observations at energies where both, the Landau-Pomeranchuk-Migdal (LPM) effect and magnetospheric interactions are important for the development of the cascades. We base our analysis on the $X_{max}$ parameter, which is already a well known composition discrimination parameter for ground based fluorescence observatories. Our analysis applies to orbiting detectors in general. Nevertheless, we exemplify the practical utilization of our technique by estimating a general upper limit to the photon fraction in the integral flux, attainable by an ideal orbital detector with characteristics similar to JEM-EUSO. In the process we describe the resultant asymmetry in the photon-hadron discrimination efficiency in galactic coordinates. "
"We are concerned with viscous profiles (travelling waves and steady solutions) for mixed hyperbolic-parabolic systems in one space variable. For a class of systems including the compressible Navier Stokes equation, these profiles satisfy a singular ordinary differential equation in the form \label{e:ab} dU / dt = F(U)/ z (U) . Here U takes values in $R^d$ and $F: R^d \to R^d$ is a regular function. The real valued function $z (U)$ is as well regular, but the equation is singular because $z (U)$ can attain the value 0. We focus on a small enough neighbourhood of a point $\bar U$ satisfying $F(\bar U) = \vec 0$, $z (\bar U) =0$. From the point of view of the applications to the study of hyperbolic-parabolic systems this means restricting to systems with small total variation. We discuss how to extend the notions of center manifold and of uniformly stable manifold. Also, we give conditions ensuring that if $z (U) \neq 0$ at $t=0$ then $z (U) \neq 0$ at every $t$. We provide an example showing that if $z(U)$ becomes zero in finite time then in general the solution $U$ of equation \eqref{e:ab} is not continuously differentiable. "
"Let $\alpha, \beta \geq 0$ and $\alpha + \beta < 1$. In this short note, we show that $\liminf_{n \to \infty} p_n^\beta(p_{n+1}^\alpha - p_n^\alpha) = 0$, where $p_n$ is the $n$th prime. This notes an improvement over results of S\'{a}ndor and gives additional evidence towards a conjecture of Andrica. This follows directly from recent results on prime pairs from Maynard, Tao, Zhang. "
"We study the electronic energy spectra and wave functions on the square Fibonacci tiling, using an off-diagonal tight-binding model, in order to determine the exact nature of the transitions between different spectral behaviors, as well as the scaling of the total bandwidth as it becomes finite. The macroscopic degeneracy of certain energy values in the spectrum is invoked as a possible mechanism for the emergence of extended electronic Bloch wave functions as the dimension changes from one to two. "
"This paper presents a readout system designed for testing the prototype of Small-Strip Thin Gap Chamber (sTGC), which is one of the main detector technologies used for ATLAS New-Small-Wheel Upgrade. This readout system aims at testing one full-size sTGC quadruplet with cosmic muon triggers. "
"The advent of radioactive ion beam facilities and new detector technologies have opened up new possibilities to investigate the radioactive decays of highly unstable nuclei, in particular the proton emission, $\alpha$ decay and heavy cluster decays from neutron-deficient (or proton-rich) nuclei around the proton drip line. It turns out that these decay measurements can serve as a unique probe for studying the structure of the nuclei involved. On the theoretical side, the development in nuclear many-body theories and supercomputing facilities have also made it possible to simulate the nuclear clusterization and decays from a microscopic and consistent perspective. In this article we would like to review the current status of these structure and decay studies in heavy nuclei, regarding both experimental and theoretical opportunities. We then discuss in detail the recent progress in our understanding of the nuclear $\alpha$ formation probabilities in heavy nuclei and their indication on the underlying nuclear structure. "
"The process of diffusive shock acceleration relies on the efficacy with which hydromagnetic waves can scatter charged particles in the precursor of a shock. The growth of self-generated waves is driven by both resonant and non-resonant processes. We perform high-resolution magnetohydrodynamic simulations of the non-resonant cosmic-ray driven instability, in which the unstable waves are excited beyond the linear regime. In a snapshot of the resultant field, particle transport simulations are carried out. The use of a static snapshot of the field is reasonable given that the Larmor period for particles is typically very short relative to the instability growth time. The diffusion rate is found to be close to, or below, the Bohm limit for a range of energies. This provides the first explicit demonstration that self-excited turbulence reduces the diffusion coefficient and has important implications for cosmic ray transport and acceleration in supernova remnants. "
We study a flat 3-brane in presence of a linear $k$ field with nonzero cosmological constant $\Lambda_{4}$. In this model the crossing of the phantom divide (PD) occurs when the $k$-essence energy density becomes negative. We show that in the high energy regime the effective equation of state has a resemblance of a modified Chaplygin gas while in the low energy regime it becomes linear. We find a scale factor that begins from a singularity and evolves to a de Sitter stable stage while other solutions have a super-accelerated regime and end with a big rip. We use the energy conditions to show when the effective equation of state of the brane-universe crosses the PD.
"In this paper a new mathematical model is proposed for task scheduling and resource allocation in Grid systems. In this novel model, load balancing, starvation prevention and failing strategies are stated as the constraints and the solution is restricted with a predefined quality of service for users with different priorities. These strategies are defined by resource providers based on the amount of submitted jobs to Grid. To solve the proposed model, a modern approximate Auction-based algorithm is developed and it is implemented as a prototype of Grid simulator namely Multi-S-Grid. The results are illustrated on 18 different large-scale Grid systems with different random capabilities and different users. The outcomes reveal the reasonable performance of the proposed Auction-based algorithm to solve Grid system optimization models. "
"We have initiated a dedicated search for new CVs, selecting candidates on the base of their spectroscopic properties in the Hamburg Quasar Survey (HQS), which lead up to now to the identification of 50 new CVs and a dozen good candidates. Using the HQS data of the previously known CVs for extensive tests of our selection scheme, we demonstrate that our survey should be very efficient in finding short period systems as long as they have emission lines with equivalent widths >=10 A. So far, orbital periods have been measured for 15 of the new CVs, with the surprising result that only two systems lie at or below the lower boundary of the period gap. This - somewhat preliminary - result is in uncomfortable disagreement with the predictions of the standard scenario of CV evolution. "
We study the space-times admitting a null conformal Killing-Yano tensor whose divergence defines a Killing vector. We analyze the similitudes and differences with the recently studied non null case (Gen. Relativ. Grav. (2015) {\bf 47} 1911). The results by Barnes concerning the Birkhoff theorem for the case of null orbits are analyzed and generalized.
"We study the effect of focusing of the radially and azimuthally polarized vector beams on the spin angular momentum (SAM) density and Poynting vector of scattered waves from a Mie particle. Remarkably, the study reveals that the SAM density of the scattered field is solely transverse in nature for radially and azimuthally polarized incident vector beams; however the Poynting vector shows usual longitudinal character. We also demonstrate that the transverse SAM density can further be tuned with wavelength and focusing of the incident beam by exploiting the interference of different scattering modes. These results may stimulate further experimental technique of detecting the transverse spin and Belinfante's spin-momentum densities. "
"An intrinsic curvature model is investigated using the canonical Monte Carlo simulations on dynamically triangulated spherical surfaces of size upto N=4842 with two fixed-vertices separated by the distance 2L. We found a first-order transition at finite curvature coefficient \alpha, and moreover that the order of the transition remains unchanged even when L is enlarged such that the surfaces become sufficiently oblong. This is in sharp contrast to the known results of the same model on tethered surfaces, where the transition weakens to a second-order one as L is increased. The phase transition of the model in this paper separates the smooth phase from the crumpled phase. The surfaces become string-like between two point-boundaries in the crumpled phase. On the contrary, we can see a spherical lump on the oblong surfaces in the smooth phase. The string tension was calculated and was found to have a jump at the transition point. The value of \sigma is independent of L in the smooth phase, while it increases with increasing L in the crumpled phase. This behavior of \sigma is consistent with the observed scaling relation \sigma \sim (2L/N)^\nu, where \nu\simeq 0 in the smooth phase, and \nu=0.93\pm 0.14 in the crumpled phase. We should note that a possibility of a continuous transition is not completely eliminated. "
"Self-gravitating relativistic disks around black holes can form as transient structures in a number of astrophysical scenarios such as binary neutron star and black hole-neutron star coalescences, as well as the core-collapse of massive stars. We explore the stability of such disks against runaway and non-axisymmetric instabilities using three-dimensional hydrodynamics simulations in full general relativity using the THOR code. We model the disk matter using the ideal fluid approximation with a $\Gamma$-law equation of state with $\Gamma=4/3$. We explore three disk models around non-rotating black holes with disk-to-black hole mass ratios of 0.24, 0.17 and 0.11. Due to metric blending in our initial data, all of our initial models contain an initial axisymmetric perturbation which induces radial disk oscillations. Despite these oscillations, our models do not develop the runaway instability during the first several orbital periods. Instead, all of the models develop unstable non-axisymmetric modes on a dynamical timescale. We observe two distinct types of instabilities: the Papaloizou-Pringle and the so-called intermediate type instabilities. The development of the non-axisymmetric mode with azimuthal number m = 1 is accompanied by an outspiraling motion of the black hole, which significantly amplifies the growth rate of the m = 1 mode in some cases. Overall, our simulations show that the properties of the unstable non-axisymmetric modes in our disk models are qualitatively similar to those in Newtonian theory. "
"We report on long-term monitoring of anomalous X-ray pulsars (AXPs) using the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer. Using phase-coherent timing, we find a wide variety of behaviors among the sources, ranging from high stability (in 1E 2259.1+586 and 4U 0142+61), to instabilities so severe that phase-coherent timing is not possible (in 1E 1048.1-5937). We note a correlation in which timing stability in AXPs decreases with increasing spin-down rate. The timing stability of soft gamma repeaters in quiescence is consistent with this trend, which is similar to one seen in radio pulsars. We consider high signal-to-noise ratio average pulse profiles as a function of energy for each AXP, and find a variety of behaviors. We find no large variability in pulse morphology nor in pulsed flux as a function of time. "
"We prove that under certain mild assumptions, the entropy rate of a hidden Markov chain, observed when passing a finite-state stationary Markov chain through a discrete-time continuous-output channel, is jointly analytic as a function of the input Markov chain parameters and the channel parameters. In particular, as consequences of the main theorems, we obtain analyticity for the entropy rate associated with representative channels: Cauchy and Gaussian. "
"We give a simple way to detect the geometric phase shift and the conditional geometric phase shift with Josephson junction system. Comparing with the previous work(Falcl G, Fazio R, Palma G.M., Siewert J and Verdal V, {\it Nature} {\bf 407}, 355(2000)), our scheme has two advantages. We use the non-adiabatic operation, thus the detection is less affected by the decoherence. Also, we take the time evolution on zero dynamic phase loop, we need not take any extra operation to cancel the dynamic phase. "
"Whether a spin-1/2 Fermi gas will become ferromagnetic as the strength of repulsive interaction increases is a long-standing controversial issue. Recently this problem is studied experimentally by Jo et al, Science, 325, 1521 (2009) in which the authors claim a ferromagnetic transition is observed. This work is to point out the results of this experiment can not distinguish whether the system is in a ferromagnetic state or in a non-magnetic but strongly short-range correlated state. A conclusive experimental demonstration of ferromagnetism relies on the observation of ferromagnetic domains. "
"This article presents a simple characterization for entangled vectors in a finite dimensional Hilbert space $H$. The characterization is in terms of the coefficients of an expansion of the vector relative to an orthonormal basis for $H$. This simple necessary and sufficient condition contains a restriction and we also present a more complicated condition that is completely general. Although these characterizations apply to bipartite systems, we show that generalizations to multipartite systems are also valid. "
"This paper investigates the detailed dynamical properties of a relatively homogeneous sample of disc-dominated S0 galaxies, with a view to understanding their formation, evolution and structure. By using high signal-to-noise ratio long-slit spectra of edge-on systems, we have been able to reconstruct the complete line-of-sight velocity distributions of stars along the galaxies' major axes. From these data, we have derived both model distribution functions (the phase density of their stars) and the approximate form of their gravitational potentials. The derived distribution functions are all consistent with these galaxies being simple disc systems, with no evidence for a complex formation history. Essentially no correlation is found between the characteristic mass scale-lengths and the photometric scale-lengths in these galaxies, suggesting that they are dark-matter dominated even in their inner parts. Similarly, no correlation is found between the mass scale-lengths and asymptotic rotation speed, implying a wide range of dark matter halo properties. By comparing their asymptotic rotation speeds with their absolute magnitudes, we find that these S0 galaxies are systematically offset from the Tully-Fisher relation for later-type galaxies. The offset in luminosity is what one would expect if star formation had been suddenly switched off a few Gyrs ago, consistent with a simple picture in which these S0s were created from ordinary later-type spirals which were stripped of their star-forming ISM when they encountered a dense cluster environment.

"We establish a link between Archimedes' method of integration for calculating areas, volumes and centers of mass of segments of parabolas and quadrics of revolution by factorization via the moments of a balance and an integration technique for a particular integrable system, namely Bianchi's B\""{a}cklund transformation for quadrics. "
"-Recent advances in microelectronics have enabled the realization of Wireless Body Area Networks (WBANs). However , the massive growth in wireless devices and the push for interconnecting these devices to form an Internet of Things (IoT) can be challenging for WBANs; hence robust communication is necessary through careful medium access arbitration. In this paper, we propose a new protocol to enable WBAN operation within an IoT. Basically, we leverage the emerging Bluetooth Low Energy technology (BLE) and promote the integration of a BLE transceiver and a Cognitive Radio module (CR) within the WBAN coordinator. Accordingly, a BLE informs WBANs through announcements about the frequency channels that are being used in their vicinity. To mitigate interference, the superframe's active period is extended to involve not only a Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) frame, but also a Flexible Channel Selection (FCS) and a Flexible Backup TDMA (FBTDMA) frames. The WBAN sensors that experience interference on the default channel within the TDMA frame will eventually switch to another Interference Mitigation Channel (IMC). With the help of CR, an IMC is selected for a WBAN and each interfering sensor will be allocated a time-slot within the (FBTDMA) frame to retransmit using such IMC. "
"We propose some new method of constructing configurations, which consists in consecutive inscribing copies of one underlying configuration. A uniform characterization of the obtained class and the one introduced in our paper untitled ""Multiplied configurations, series induced by correlations"", which makes use of some covering by family of closed substructures, is given. "
"We investigate the condition for capture into first-order mean motion resonances using numerical simulations with a wide range of various parameters. In particular, we focus on deriving the critical migration timescale for capture into the 2:1 resonance; additional numerical experiments for closely spaced resonances (e.g., 3:2) are also performed. We find that the critical migration timescale is determined by the planet-to-stellar mass ratio, and its dependence exhibits power-law behavior with index -4/3. This dependence is also supported by simple analytic arguments. We also find that the critical migration timescale for systems with equal-mass bodies is shorter than that in the restricted problem; for instance, for the 2:1 resonance between two equal-mass bodies, the critical timescale decreases by a factor of 10. In addition, using the obtained formula, the origin of observed systems that include first-order commensurabilities is constrained. Assuming that pairs of planets originally form well separated from each other and then undergo convergent migration and are captured in resonances, it is possible that a number of exoplanets experienced rapid orbital migration. For systems in closely spaced resonances, the differential migration timescale between the resonant pair can be constrained well; it is further suggested that several exoplanets underwent migration that can equal or even exceed the type I migration rate predicted by the linear theory. This implies that some of them may have formed in situ. Future observations and the use of our model will allow us to statistically determine the typical migration speed in a protoplanetary disk. "
In this paper we show that the tree class of a component of the stable Auslander-Reiten quiver of a Frobenius-Lusztig kernel is one of the three infinite Dynkin diagrams. For the special case of the small quantum group we show that the periodic components are homogeneous tubes and that the non-periodic components have shape Z[A_\infty] if the component contains a module for the infinite-dimensional quantum group.
"If the function $f$ is transcendental and meromorphic in the plane, and either $f$ has finitely many poles or its inverse function has a logarithmic singularity over infinity, then the equation $\dot z = f(z)$ has infinitely many trajectories tending to infinity in finite increasing time "
"In the following work we consider the possibility of explaining the observed baryon number asymmetry in the universe from simple baryon number violating modifications, involving massive scalar bosons, to the Standard Model. In these cases baryon number violation is mediated through a combination of Yukawa and scalar self-coupling interactions. Starting with a previously compiled catalogue of baryon-number violating extensions of the Standard Model, we identify the minimal subsets which can induce a $B-L$ asymmetry and thus be immune to sphaleron washout. For each of these models, we identify the region of parameter space that leads to the production of a baryon number asymmetry of the correct order of magnitude. "
"The Next-to-Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (NMSSM) offers a rich framework embedding physics beyond the Standard Model as well as consistent interpretations of the results about the Higgs signal detected at the LHC. We investigate the decays of neutral Higgs states into Standard Model (SM) fermions and gauge bosons. We perform full one-loop calculations of the decay widths and include leading higher-order QCD corrections. We first discuss the technical aspects of our approach, before confronting our predictions to those of existing public tools, performing a numerical analysis and discussing the remaining theoretical uncertainties. In particular, we find that the decay widths of doublet-dominated heavy Higgs bosons into electroweak gauge bosons are dominated by the radiative corrections, so that the tree-level approximations that are often employed in phenomenological analyses fail. Finally, we focus on the phenomenological properties of a mostly singlet-like state with a mass below the one at $125\,$GeV, a scenario that appears commonly within the NMSSM. In fact, the possible existence of a singlet-dominated state in the mass range around or just below $100\,$GeV would have interesting phenomenological implications. Such a scenario could provide an interpretation for both the $2.3\sigma$ local excess observed at LEP in the $e^+e^-\to Z(H\to b\bar{b})$ searches at $\sim 98\,$GeV and for the local excess in the diphoton searches recently reported by CMS in this mass range, while at the same time it would reduce the ""Little Hierarchy"" problem. "
"In this article, we obtain quasiconformal extensions of some classes of conformal maps defined either on the unit disc or on the exterior of it onto the extended complex plane. Some of these extensions have been obtained by constructing suitable Loewner chains and others have been obtained by applying a well-known result. "
"For a big class of commutative rings R every continuous R-automorphism of R[[X_1,...,X_n]] with the identity linear part is in the commutator subgroup of Aut(R[[X_1,...,X_n]]). An explicit bound for the number of the involved commutators and a K-theoretic interpretation of this result are provided. "
"After having reported the detection of X-rays emitted by the peculiar system HD5980, we assess here the origin of this high-energy emission from additional X-ray observations obtained with XMM-Newton. This research provides the first detection of apparently periodic X-ray emission from hot gas produced by the collision of winds in an evolved massive binary outside the Milky Way. It also provides the first X-ray monitoring of a Luminous Blue Variable only years after its eruption and shows that the dominant source of the X-rays is not associated with the ejecta. "
"ProbLog is a state-of-art combination of logic programming and probabilities; in particular ProbLog offers parameter learning through a variant of the EM algorithm. However, the resulting learning algorithm is rather slow, even when the data are complete. In this short paper we offer some insights that lead to orders of magnitude improvements in ProbLog's parameter learning speed with complete data. "
"We present a power spectral analysis of the Crab pulsar's timing noise, mainly using radio measurements from Jodrell Bank taken over the period 1982-1989. The power spectral analysis is complicated by nonuniform data sampling and the presence of a steep red power spectrum that can distort power spectra measurement by causing severe power ``leakage''. We develop a simple windowing method for computing red noise power spectra of uniformly sampled data sets and test it on Monte Carlo generated sample realizations of red power-law noise. We generalize time-domain methods of generating power-law red noise with even integer spectral indices to the case of noninteger spectral indices. The Jodrell Bank pulse phase residuals are dense and smooth enough that an interpolation onto a uniform time series is possible. A windowed power spectrum is computed revealing a periodic or nearly periodic component with a period of about 568 days and a 1/f^3 power-law noise component with a noise strength of 1.24 +/- 0.067 10^{-16} cycles^2/sec^2 over the analysis frequency range 0.003 - 0.1 cycles/day. This result deviates from past analyses which characterized the pulse phase timing residuals as either 1/f^4 power-law noise or a quasiperiodic process. The analysis was checked using the Deeter polynomial method of power spectrum estimation that was developed for the case of nonuniform sampling, but has lower spectral resolution. The timing noise is consistent with a torque noise spectrum rising with analysis frequency as f implying blue torque noise, a result not predicted by current models of pulsar timing noise. If the periodic or nearly periodic component is due to a binary companion, we find a companion mass > 3.2 Earth masses. "
"We introduce geomstats, a python package that performs computations on manifolds such as hyperspheres, hyperbolic spaces, spaces of symmetric positive definite matrices and Lie groups of transformations. We provide efficient and extensively unit-tested implementations of these manifolds, together with useful Riemannian metrics and associated Exponential and Logarithm maps. The corresponding geodesic distances provide a range of intuitive choices of Machine Learning loss functions. We also give the corresponding Riemannian gradients. The operations implemented in geomstats are available with different computing backends such as numpy, tensorflow and keras. We have enabled GPU implementation and integrated geomstats manifold computations into keras deep learning framework. This paper also presents a review of manifolds in machine learning and an overview of the geomstats package with examples demonstrating its use for efficient and user-friendly Riemannian geometry. "
"We analyze the quantum dynamics of radiation propagating in a single mode optical fiber with dispersion, nonlinearity, and Raman coupling to thermal phonons. We start from a fundamental Hamiltonian that includes the principal known nonlinear effects and quantum noise sources, including linear gain and loss. Both Markovian and frequency-dependent, non-Markovian reservoirs are treated. This allows quantum Langevin equations to be calculated, which have a classical form except for additional quantum noise terms. In practical calculations, it is more useful to transform to Wigner or +$P$ quasi-probability operator representations. These result in stochastic equations that can be analyzed using perturbation theory or exact numerical techniques. The results have applications to fiber optics communications, networking, and sensor technology. "
"We construct gauge theory of SU(3)xSU(2)xU(1) by spectral cover from F-theory and ask how the Standard Model is extended under minimal assumptions on Higgs sector. For the requirement on different numbers between Higgs pairs and matter generations (respectively one and three) distinguished by R-parity, we choose a universal G-flux obeying SO(10) but slightly breaking E_6 unification relation. This condition forces distinction between up and down Higgs fields, suppression of proton decay operators up to dimension five, and existence and dynamics of a singlet related to mu-parameter. "
"In the Langevin formalism, the delicate balance maintained between the fluctuations in the system and their corresponding dissipation may be upset by the presence of a secondary, space-dependent stochastic force, particularly in the low friction regime. In prior work, the latter was dissipated self-consistently through an additional uniform (mean-field) friction [Shepherd and Hernandez, J. Chem. Phys., 115, 2430-2438 (2001).] An alternative approach to ensure that equipartition is satisfied relies on the use of a space-dependent friction while ignoring nonlocal correlations. The approach is evaluated with respect to its ability to maintain constant temperature for two simple one-dimensional, stochastic potentials of mean force wherein the friction can be evaluated explicitly when there is no memory in the barriers. The use of a space-dependent friction is capable of providing qualitatively similar results to those obtained previously, but in extreme cases, deviations from equipartition may be observed due to the neglect of the memory effects present in the stochastic potentials. "
"A human brain is capable of continual learning by nature; however the current mainstream deep neural networks suffer from a phenomenon named catastrophic forgetting (i.e., learning a new set of patterns suddenly and completely would result in fully forgetting what has already been learned). In this paper we propose a generic learning model, which regards a learning system as a fiber bundle. By comparing the learning performance of our model with conventional ones whose neural networks are multilayer perceptrons through a variety of machine-learning experiments, we found our proposed model not only enjoys a distinguished capability of continual learning but also bears a high information capacity. In addition, we found in some learning scenarios the learning performance can be further enhanced by making the learning time-aware to mimic the episodic memory in human brain. Last but not least, we found that the properties of forgetting in our model correspond well to those of human memory. This work may shed light on how a human brain learns. "
"We propose a new hypothesis for the origin of non-solar hadronic cosmic rays (CRs) at all energies: Highly relativistic, narrowly collimated jets from the birth or collapse of neutron stars (NSs) in our Galaxy accelerate ambient disk and halo matter to CR energies and disperse it in ``hot spots'' which they form when they stop in the Galactic halo. Such events - ``Galactic Gamma-Ray Bursters'' (GGRBs) - are proposed to cause cosmological gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) in other galaxies when their beamed radiation happens to point in our direction. Our hypothesis naturally explains some observations which are difficult to understand with the currently popular ideas about CR origin - e.g. the small Galacto-centric gradient of the cosmic-ray density and the absence of the Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin cutoff. Our idea stands or falls with the existence of the ``hot spots'' (``GGRB remnants'') in the Galactic halo. We discuss their expected observational signatures and find that they could appear as EGRET unidentified high-latitude sources. "
"While the dynamics of many complex systems is dominated by activated events, there are very few simulation methods that take advantage of this fact. Most of these procedures are restricted to relatively simple systems or, as with the activation-relaxation technique (ART), sample the conformation space efficiently at the cost of a correct thermodynamical description. We present here an extension of ART, the properly-obeying-probability ART (POP-ART), that obeys detailed balance and samples correctly the thermodynamic ensemble. Testing POP-ART on two model systems, a vacancy and an interstitial in crystalline silicon, we show that this method recovers the proper thermodynamical weights associated with the various accessible states and is significantly faster than MD in the diffusion of a vacancy below 700 K. "
"The simplest version of the method of detection of single molecular scattering basing on the polarization measurements of the twilight sky background by all-sky cameras is considered. The method can be used during the transitive twilight (solar zenith angles 94-98 degrees), when effective single scattering takes place in upper stratosphere and lower mesosphere. The application of the method to the multi-year measurements in the vicinity of Moscow and Apatity allows determination of temperature of these atmospheric layers and estimation of contribution and properties of multiple scattering during the transitive twilight period. "
"In this work we study theoretically the coupling of single molecule magnets (SMMs) to a variety of quantum circuits, including microwave resonators with and without constrictions and flux qubits. The main results of this study is that it is possible to achieve strong and ultrastrong coupling regimes between SMM crystals and the superconducting circuit, with strong hints that such a coupling could also be reached for individual molecules close to constrictions. Building on the resulting coupling strengths and the typical coherence times of these molecules (of the order of microseconds), we conclude that SMMs can be used for coherent storage and manipulation of quantum information, either in the context of quantum computing or in quantum simulations. Throughout the work we also discuss in detail the family of molecules that are most suitable for such operations, based not only on the coupling strength, but also on the typical energy gaps and the simplicity with which they can be tuned and oriented. Finally, we also discuss practical advantages of SMMs, such as the possibility to fabricate the SMMs ensembles on the chip through the deposition of small droplets. "
"We calculate the ${\cal O}(\alpha_s)$ radiative corrections to the spin dependent differential decay rates of the process $t\rightarrow b+W^+$. These are needed to study the angular distribution of the energy of hadrons produced in polarized top quark decays at next-to-leading order (NLO). In our previous work, we studied the angular distribution of the scaled-energy of bottom-flavored hadrons (B) from polarized top quark decays, using a specific helicity coordinate system where the top quark spin was measured relative to the bottom momentum (system~1). Here, we study the angular distribution of the energy spectrum of B-hadron in a different helicity system, where the top spin is specified relative to the W-momentum (system~2). These energy distributions are governed by the polarized and unpolarized rate functions which are related to the density matrix elements of the decay $t\rightarrow W^++b$. Through this paper, we present our predictions of the B-hadron spectrum in the polarized and unpolarized top decay and shall compare the polarized results in two different helicity systems. These predictions can be used to determine the polarization states of top quarks and also provide direct access to the B-hadron fragmentation functions (FFs) and allow us to deepen our knowledge of the hadroniazation process. "
"We study in detail Hodge-Helmholtz decompositions in non-smooth exterior domains filled with inhomogeneous and anisotropic media. We show decompositions of alternating differential forms belonging to weighted Sobolev spaces into irrotational and solenoidal forms. These decompositions are essential tools, for example, in electro-magnetic theory for exterior domains. In the appendix we translate our results to the classical framework of vector analysis. "
"Measurements of the energy spectrum and of the vortex-density fluctuation spectrum in superfluid turbulence seem to contradict each other. Using a numerical model, we show that at each instance of time the total vortex line density can be decomposed into two parts: one formed by metastable bundles of coherent vortices, and one in which the vortices are randomly oriented. We show that the former is responsible for the observed Kolmogorov energy spectrum, and the latter for the spectrum of the vortex line density fluctuations. "
"It was pointed out in Crisan, Ghazali [2] that the error estimate for the cubature on Wiener space algorithm developed in Lyons, Victoir [11] requires an additional assumption on the drift. In this note we demonstrate that it is straightforward to adopt the analysis of Kusuoka [7] to obtain a general estimate without an additional assumptions on the drift. In the process we slightly sharpen the bounds derived in [7]. "
"The high-temperature phase of Yang-Mills theory in Landau gauge is studied using Dyson-Schwinger equations. The propagators of the gluon and the Faddeev-Popov ghosts are obtained at finite and infinite temperature, partially analytically. The results are in good agreement with lattice results. It is found that the infrared properties are only quantitatively affected by temperature. The confinement of at least soft gluons transverse to the heat bath is established, in accordance with the Kugo-Ojima and Gribov-Zwanziger confinement scenarios. This is confirmed by investigating the corresponding Schwinger functions. The hard modes are nearly inert even at temperatures of the order of the phase transition temperature. In addition, the thermodynamic potential is analyzed and solutions for 3d-Yang-Mills theory are obtained. It is conjectured that Yang-Mills theory likely undergoes a first order phase transition, which changes a strongly interacting system into another. The phases differ mainly by the properties of the chromoelectric sector. "
"In a first historical part I shall give a detailed description of how Pauli discovered --before the advent of the new quantum mechanics -- his exclusion principle. The second part is devoted to the insight and results that have been obtained in more recent times in our understanding of the stability of matter in bulk, both for ordinary matter (like stones) and self-gravitating bodies. "
"We study a one-dimensional lattice random walk with an absorbing boundary at the origin and a movable partial reflector. On encountering the reflector, at site x, the walker is reflected (with probability r) to x-1 and the reflector is simultaneously pushed to x+1. Iteration of the transition matrix, and asymptotic analysis of the probability generating function show that the critical exponent delta governing the survival probability varies continuously between 1/2 and 1 as r varies between 0 and 1. Our study suggests a mechanism for nonuniversal kinetic critical behavior, observed in models with an infinite number of absorbing configurations. "
"It is well known that the category of covering projections (that is, locally constant objects) of a locally connected topos is equivalent to the classifying topos of a strict progroupoid (or, equivalently, a localic prodiscrete groupoid), the \emph{fundamental progroupoid}, and that this progroupoid represents first degree cohomology. In this paper we generalize these results to an arbitrary topos. The fundamental progroupoid is now a localic progroupoid, and can not be replaced by a localic groupoid. The classifying topos in not any more a Galois topos. Not all locally constant objects can be considered as covering projections. The key contribution of this paper is a novel definition of covering projection for a general topos, which coincides with the usual definition when the topos is locally connected. The results in this paper were presented in a talk at the Category Theory Conference, Vancouver July 2004. "
"There is no proof yet of convergence of Genetic Algorithms. We do not supply it too. Instead, we present some thoughts and arguments to convince the Reader, that Genetic Algorithms are essentially bound for success. For this purpose, we consider only the crossover operators, single- or multiple-point, together with selection procedure. We also give a proof that the soft selection is superior to other selection schemes. "
"The family of generalized Pseudo-Spectral Time Domain (including the Pseudo-Spectral Analytical Time Domain) Particle-in-Cell algorithms offers substantial versatility for simulating particle beams and plasmas, and well written codes using these algorithms run reasonably fast. When simulating relativistic beams and streaming plasmas in multiple dimensions, they are, however, subject to the numerical Cherenkov instability. Previous studies have shown that instability growth rates can be reduced substantially by modifying slightly the transverse fields as seen by the streaming particles . Here, we offer an approach which completely eliminates the fundamental mode of the numerical Cherenkov instability while minimizing the transverse field corrections. The procedure, numerically computed residual growth rates (from weaker, higher order instability aliases), and comparisons with WARP simulations are presented. In some instances, there are no numerical instabilities whatsoever, at least in the linear regime. "
"We consider QCD at very low temperatures and non-zero quark chemical potential from lattice Monte Carlo simulations of the two-color theory in a very small spatial volume (the attoscale). In this regime the quark number rises in discrete levels in qualitative agreement with what is found analytically at one loop on S3xS1 with radius R_S3 << 1/{\Lambda}_QCD. The detailed level degeneracy, however, cannot be accounted for using weak coupling arguments. At each rise in the quark number there is a corresponding spike in the Polyakov line, also in agreement with the perturbative results. In addition the quark number susceptibility shows a similar behaviour to the Polyakov line and appears to be a good indicator of a confinement-deconfinement type of transition. "
"Let $X$ be a set of $K$-rational points in $P^1 \times P^1$ over a field $K$ of characteristic zero, let $Y$ be a fat point scheme supported at $ X$, and let $R_Y$ be the bihomogeneus coordinate ring of $Y$. In this paper we investigate the module of Kaehler differentials $\Omega^1_{R_Y/K}$. We describe this bigraded $R_Y$-module explicitly via a homogeneous short exact sequence and compute its Hilbert function in a number of special cases, in particular when the support $X$ is a complete intersection or an almost complete intersection in $P^1 \times P^1$. Moreover, we introduce a Kaehler different for $Y$ and use it to characterize reduced fat point schemes in $P^1 \times P^1$ having the Cayley-Bacharach property. "
"We consider noise-assisted spike propagation in myelinated axons within a multi-compartment stochastic Hodgkin-Huxley model. The noise originates from a finite number of ion channels in each node of Ranvier. For the subthreshold internodal electric coupling, we show that (i) intrinsic noise removes the sharply defined threshold for spike propagation from node to node, and (ii) there exists an optimum number of ion channels which allows for the most efficient signal propagation and it corresponds to the actual physiological values. "
"In this paper, I construct a new test of conditional moment inequalities, which is based on studentized kernel estimates of moment functions with many different values of the bandwidth parameter. The test automatically adapts to the unknown smoothness of moment functions and has uniformly correct asymptotic size. The test has high power in a large class of models with conditional moment inequalities. Some existing tests have nontrivial power against n^{-1/2}-local alternatives in a certain class of these models whereas my method only allows for nontrivial testing against (n/\log n)^{-1/2}-local alternatives in this class. There exist, however, other classes of models with conditional moment inequalities where the mentioned tests have much lower power in comparison with the test developed in this paper. "
"The article presents the results of experiments in computation of statistical values related to Young diagrams, including the estimates on maximum and average (by Plancherel distribution) dimension of irreducible representation of symmetric group $S_n$. The computed limit shapes of two-dimensional and three-dimensional diagrams distributed by Richardson statistics are presented as well. "
"We answer a question of Alon, Mossel, and Pemantle about the corruption detection model on graphs in the noisy setting. "
"Magnetic and dielectric properties of the hexagonal triangular lattice antiferromagnet 2H-AgFeO2 have been studied by neutron diffraction, magnetic susceptibility, specific heat, pyroelectric current, and dielectric constant measurements. The ferroelectric polarization, P ~ 5 {\mu}C/m2, has been found to appear below 11 K due to a polar nature of the magnetic ground state of the system. In the temperature range of 11 K < T < 18 K, an incommensurate spin density wave (ICM1) with the nonpolar magnetic point group mmm1' and the k1 = (0,q1_b,0; q1_b = 0.390-0.405)propagation vector takes place. Below 14 K, a proper screw ordering (ICM2) and k2 = (0,q2_b,0; q2_b = 0.385-0.396) appears as a minor phase which coexists with ICM1 and the ground state down to the lowestmeasured temperature 5.5 K. No ferroelectric polarization associated with the ICM2 phase was observed in agreement with its nonpolar point group 2221'. Finally, a spiral order with cycloid and proper screw components (ICM3), and k3 = (q3_a,q3_b,0; q3_a = 0.0467, q3_b = 0.349) emerges below 11 K as the ground state of the system. Based on the deduced magnetic point group 21', we conclude that the ferroelectric polarization in ICM3 is parallel to the c axis and is caused by the inverse Dzyloshinskii-Moriya effect with p1 ~ rij x (Si x Sj ). Unlike the rhombohedral 3R-AgFeO2 polytype, the additional contribution to the macroscopic polarization p2 ~ Si x Sj is not allowed in the present case due to the symmetry constraints imposed by the hexagonal lattice of 2H-AgFeO2.

"Accretion onto magnetized neutron stars is expected to be centrifugally inhibited at low accretion rates. Several sources, however, are known to pulsate in quiescence at luminosities below the theoretical limit predicted for the onset of the centrifugal barrier. The source 1A 0535+262 is one of them. Here we present the results of an analysis of a ~50 ks long XMM-Newton observation of 1A 0535+262 in quiescence. At the time of the observation, the neutron star was close to apastron, and the source had remained quiet for two orbital cycles. In spite of this, we detected a pulsed X-ray flux of ~3e-11 erg/cm2/s . Several observed properties, including the power spectrum, remained similar to those observed in the outbursts. Particularly, we have found that the frequency of the break detected in the quiescent noise power spectrum follows the same correlation with flux observed when the source is in outburst. This correlation has been associated with the truncation of the accretion disk at the magnetosphere boundary. We argue that our result, along with other arguments previously reported in the literature, suggests that the accretion in quiescence also proceeds from an accretion disk around the neutron star. The proposed scenario consistently explains the energy of the cyclotron line observed in 1A 0535+262, and the timing properties of the source including the spin frequency evolution within and between the outbursts, and the frequency of the break in power spectrum.

"Magic numbers predicted by a 3-dimensional q-deformed harmonic oscillator with Uq(3)>SOq(3) symmetry are compared to experimental data for atomic clusters of alkali metals (Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs), noble metals (Cu, Ag, Au), divalent metals (Zn, Cd), and trivalent metals (Al, In), as well as to theoretical predictions of jellium models, Woods-Saxon and wine bottle potentials, and to the classification scheme using the 3n+l pseudo quantum number. In alkali metal clusters and noble metal clusters the 3-dimensional q-deformed harmonic oscillator correctly predicts all experimentally observed magic numbers up to 1500 (which is the expected limit of validity for theories based on the filling of electronic shells), while in addition it gives satisfactory results for the magic numbers of clusters of divalent metals and trivalent metals, thus indicating that Uq(3), which is a nonlinear extension of the U(3) symmetry of the spherical (3-dimensional isotropic) harmonic oscillator, is a good candidate for being the symmetry of systems of several metal clusters. The Taylor expansions of angular momentum dependent potentials approximately producing the same spectrum as the 3-dimensional q-deformed harmonic oscillator are found to be similar to the Taylor expansions of the symmetrized Woods-Saxon and wine-bottle symmetrized Woods-Saxon potentials, which are known to provide successful fits of the Ekardt potentials. "
"We investigate the decays of $\bar{B}^0_s$, $\bar{B}^0$ and $B^-$ into $\eta_c$ plus a scalar meson in a theoretical framework by taking into account the dominant process for the weak decay of $\bar{B}$ meson into $\eta_c$ and a $q\bar{q}$ pair. After hadronization of this $q\bar{q}$ component into pairs of pseudoscalar mesons we obtain certain weights for the pseudoscalar meson-pseudoscalar meson components. The calculation is based on the postulation that the scalar mesons $f_0(500)$, $f_0(980)$ and $a_0(980)$ are dynamically generated states from the pseudoscalar meson-pseudoscalar meson interactions in $S$-wave. Up to a global normalization factor, the $\pi \pi$, $K \bar{K}$ and $\pi \eta$ invariant mass distributions for the decays of $\bar B^0_s \to \eta_c \pi^+ \pi^-$, $\bar{B}^0_s \to \eta_c K^+ K^-$, $\bar B^0 \to \eta_c \pi^+ \pi^-$, $\bar{B}^0 \to \eta_c K^+ K^-$, $\bar{B}^0 \to \eta_c \pi^0 \eta$, $B^- \to \eta_c K^0 K^-$ and $B^- \to \eta_c \pi^- \eta$ are predicted. Comparison is made with the limited experimental information available and other theoretical calcualtions. Further comparison of these results with coming LHCb measurements will be very valuable to make progress in our understanding of the nature of the low lying scalar mesons, $f_0(500), f_0(980)$ and $a_0(980)$.

We calculate the masses of the $1^{-+}$ four quark states which decay dominantly into $\rho\pi$ and $\eta\pi$ respectively by QCD sum rules approach. We include the zero mode contribution and find it plays an important role in the sum rules. We predict that the masses of the states $\eta\pi$ and $\rho\pi$ both are 1.4-1.5 GeV. This is close to the experimental candidates $\pi_1(1370)$ and $\pi_1(1440)$.
"Cell movement and intercellular signaling occur simultaneously during the development of tissues, but little is known about how movement affects signaling. Previous theoretical studies have shown that faster moving cells favor synchronization across a population of locally coupled genetic oscillators. An important assumption in these studies is that cells can immediately interact with their new neighbors after arriving at a new location. However, intercellular interactions in cellular systems may need some time to become fully established. How movement affects synchronization in this situation has not been examined. Here we develop a coupled phase oscillator model in which we consider cell movement and the gradual recovery of intercellular coupling experienced by a cell after movement, characterized by a moving rate and a coupling recovery rate respectively. We find (1) an optimal moving rate for synchronization, and (2) a critical moving rate above which achieving synchronization is not possible. These results indicate that the extent to which movement enhances synchrony is limited by a gradual recovery of coupling. These findings suggest that the ratio of time scales of movement and signaling recovery is critical for information transfer between moving cells. "
"In this note I describe the structure of the biset functor $B^\times$ sending a $p$-group $P$ to the group of units of its Burnside ring $B(P)$. In particular, I show that $B^\times$ is a rational biset functor. It follows that if $P$ is a $p$-group, the structure of $B^\times(P)$ can be read from a genetic basis of $P$: the group $B^\times(P)$ is an elementary abelian 2-group of rank equal to the number isomorphism classes of rational irreducible representations of $P$ whose type is trivial, cyclic of order 2, or dihedral.

"We present a comprehensive computational study of some 900 possible ""lambda-lac"" mutants of the lysogeny maintenance switch in phage lambda, of which up to date 19 have been studied experimentally (Atsumi & Little, PNAS 103: 4558-4563, (2006)). We clarify that these mutants realise regulatory schemes quite different from wild-type lambda, and can therefore be expected to behave differently, within the conventional mechanistic setting in which this problem has often been framed. We verify that indeed, within this framework, across this wide selection of mutants the lambda-lac mutants for the most part either have no stable lytic states, or should only be inducible with difficulty. In particular, the computational results contradicts the experimental finding that four lambda-lac mutants both show stable lysogeny and are inducible. This work hence suggests either that the four out of 900 mutants are special, or that lambda lysogeny and inducibility are holistic effects involving other molecular players or other mechanisms, or both. The approach illustrates the power and versatility of computational systems biology to systematically and quickly test a wide variety of examples and alternative hypotheses for future closer experimental studies.

"Context. Scattering and absorption processes in stellar atmosphere affect the center-to-limb variations of the intensity (CLVI) and the linear polarization (CLVP) of stellar radiation. Aims. There are several theoretical and observational studies of CLVI using different stellar models, however, most studies of CLVP have concentrated on the solar atmosphere and have not considered the CLVP in cooler non-gray stellar atmospheres at all. In this paper, we present a theoretical study of the CLV of the intensity and the linear polarization in continuum spectra of different spectral type stars. Methods. We solve the radiative transfer equations for polarized light iteratively assuming no magnetic field and considering a plane-parallel model atmospheres and various opacities. Results. We calculate the CLVI and the CLVP for Phoenix stellar model atmospheres for the range of effective temperatures (4500K - 6900K), gravities (log g = 3.0 - 5.0), and wavelengths (4000 - 7000 {\AA}), which are tabulated and available at the Strasbourg astronomical Data Center (CDS). In addition, we present several tests of our code and compare our results with measurements and calculations of CLVI and the CLVP for the Sun. The resulting CLVI are fitted with polynomials and their coefficients are presented in this paper. Conclusions. For the stellar model atmospheres with lower gravity and effective temperature the CLVP is larger. "
"Resonance spectral lines such as H I Ly {\alpha}, Mg II h&k, and Ca II H&K that form in the solar chromosphere are influenced by the effects of 3D radiative transfer as well as partial redistribution (PRD). So far no one has modeled these lines including both effects simultaneously owing to the high computing demands of existing algorithms. Such modeling is however indispensable for accurate diagnostics of the chromosphere. We present a computationally tractable method to treat PRD scattering in 3D model atmospheres using a 3D non-LTE radiative transfer code. To make the method memory-friendly, we use the hybrid approximation of Leenaarts et al. (2012) for the redistribution integral. To make it fast, we use linear interpolation on equidistant frequency grids. We verify our algorithm against computations with the RH code and analyze it for stability, convergence, and usefulness of acceleration using model atoms of Mg II with the h&k lines and H I with the Ly {\alpha} line treated in PRD. A typical 3D PRD solution can be obtained in a model atmosphere with $252 \times 252 \times 496$ coordinate points in 50 000--200 000 CPU hours, which is a factor ten slower than computations assuming complete redistribution. We illustrate the importance of the joint action of PRD and 3D effects for the Mg II h&k lines for disk-center intensities as well as the center-to-limb variation. The proposed method allows simulating PRD lines in time series of radiation-MHD models in order to interpret observations of chromospheric lines at high spatial resolution. "
"The variation ranges of the axial B_{k0} crystal-field parameters, for k=2,4,6, of tetragonal including cubic crystal-field Hamiltonians H_{CF} for all possible orientations of the relevant reference frame are studied. The distinguished z-axis directions fixed by the maximal absolute values of B_{k0} are analyzed. The diagrams for any tetragonal H_{CF} parametrization depicting the maximal values of |B_{k0}|/M_{k}, where M_{k} is the 2^{k}-pole modulus, as a function of the x=B_{k4}/B_{k0} or B_{64}/B_{60} ratios, together with the distinguished directions are presented. The max|B_{k0}|/M_{k} magnitudes and the relevant distinguished directions are the discriminants of all the equivalent parametrizations. They vary within the intervals (0.7395,1], (0.6074,1] for tetragonal k=4 and tetragonal k=6 H_{CF} components, respectively. Such specified directions determine the mutual spatial orientation of the component 2^{k}-poles of the H_{CF}, and due to their rigid coupling in the H_{CF}, they also refer to the global H_{CF} parametrization. This approach demonstrates the difference in fitting capability between the real and complex isomodular H_{CF} parametrizations. "
"The existence of antimatter domains in baryon asymmetrical Universe can appear as the cosmological consequence of particle theory in inflationary models with non-homogeneous baryosynthesis. Such a domain can survive in the early Universe and form globular cluster of antimatter stars in our Galaxy. The model of antimatter pollution of Galaxy and annihilation with matter gas is developed. The proton-antiproton annihilation gamma flux is shown to reproduce the observed galactic gamma background measured by EGRET. From comparison with observational data the estimation on the maximally allowed amount of antimatter stars, possibly present in our Galaxy, is found. "
"It is generally accepted today that our solar system has undergone a phase during which the orbits of the giant planets became very unstable. In recent years, many studies have identified traces of this event and have provided reasonable justification for this occurrence. The magnitude (in terms of orbital variation) and the timing of the instability though (early or late with respect to the dispersal of the gas disk) still remains an open debate. The terrestrial planets seem to set a strict constraint: either the giant planet instability happened early, while the terrestrial planets were still forming, or the orbits of Jupiter and Saturn had to separate from each other impulsively, with a large enough `jump' in semimajor axis (Brasser et al. 2009; Kaib and Chambers 2016) for the terrestrial planets to remain stable. Because a large orbital jump is a low probability event, the early instability hypothesis seems to be favored. However, the asteroid belt would also evolve in a different way, assuming different instability amplitudes. These two constraints need to match each other in order to favor one scenario over the other. Considering an initially dynamically cold disk of asteroids, Morbidelli et al. (2010) concluded that a comparably large jump is needed to reconstruct the current asteroid belt. Here we confirm the same conclusion, but considering an asteroid population already strongly excited in eccentricity, such as that produced in the Grand Tack scenario (Walsh et al. 2011). Because the asteroids existed since the time of removal of the gas disk, unlike the terrestrial planets, this constraint on the width of the giant planet jump is valid regardless of whether the instability happened early or late. Hence, at this stage, assuming an early instability does not appear to provide any advantage in terms of the probabilistic reconstruction of the solar system structure. "
"The evolution of stars born with a convective core is highly dependent on the efficiency and extent of near core mixing processes, which effectively increases both the core mass and main-sequence lifetime. We investigate to what extent gravity-mode period spacings in slowly pulsating B-type stars observed by the Kepler mission can be used to constrain both the shape and extent of convective core overshoot and additional mixing in the radiative envelope. We compute grids of 1D stellar structure and evolution models for two different shapes of convective core overshooting and three shapes of radiative envelope mixing. The models in these grids are compared to a set of benchmark models to evaluate their capability of mimicking the dipole prograde g-modes of the benchmark models. Through our model comparisons we find that at a central hydrogen content of Xc = 0.5, dipole prograde g-modes in the period range 0.8-3 d are capable of differentiating between step and exponential diffusive overshooting. This ability disappears towards the terminal age main-sequence at Xc = 0.1. Furthermore, the g-modes behave the same for the three different shapes of radiative envelope mixing considered. However, a constant envelope mixing requires a diffusion coefficient near the convective core five times higher than chemical mixing from internal gravity waves to obtain a surface nitrogen excess of about 0.5 dex within the main-sequence lifetime. Within estimated frequency errors of the Kepler mission, the ability of g-modes to distinguish between step and exponential diffusive overshooting depends on the evolutionary stage. Combining information from the average period spacing and observed surface abundances, notably nitrogen, could potentially be used to constrain the shape of mixing in the radiative envelope of massive stars.

"We present observations made with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA), the Jansky Very Large Array (JVLA) and the Giant Metre-Wave Telescope of the radio source within the galaxy WISE~J071634.59-190039.2, claimed to be host of FRB~150418 by Keane et al. (2016). We have established a common flux density scale between the ATCA and JVLA observations, the main result of which is to increase the flux densities obtained by Keane et al. At a frequency of 5.5 GHz, the source has a mean flux density of 140uJy and is variable on short timescales with a modulation index of 0.36. Statistical analysis of the flux densities shows that the variations seen are consistent with refractive interstellar scintillation of the weak active galactic nucleus at the centre of the galaxy. It may therefore be the case that the FRB and the galaxy are not associated. However, taking into account the rarity of highly variable sources in the radio sky, and our lack of knowledge of the progenitors of FRBs as a class, the association between WISE~J071634.59-190039.2 and FRB~150418 remains a possibility. "
"We study the hadronization time of heavy quark in nuclear matter by using the coalescence model and the spatial diffusion constant of heavy quark from lattice Quantum Chromodynamic calculations, assuming that the main interaction of heavy quark at the critical temperature is hadronization. It is found that the hadronization time of heavy quark is about 3 fm/c for $2\pi T_c D_s=6$, if a heavy quark is combined with the nearest light antiquark in coordinate space without any correlation between momentum of heavy quark and that of light antiquark which form a heavy meson. However, the hadronization time reduces to 0.6-1.2 fm/c for charm and 0.4-0.9 fm/c for bottom, depending on heavy meson radius, in the presence of momentum correlation. Considering the interspace between quarks and antiquarks at the critical temperature, it seems that the hadronization of heavy quark does not happen instantaneously but gradually for a considerable time, if started from the thermal distribution of quarks and antiquarks. "
It is shown that the theory of aplanatic two-mirror telescopes developed by Karl Schwarzschild in 1905 leads to the unified description both the prefocal and the postfocal systems. The class of surfaces in the ZEMAX optical program has been properly extended to ascertain the image quality in exact Schwarzschild aplanats. A comparison of Schwarzschild aplanats with approximate Ritchey-Chretien and Gregory-Maksutov aplanatic telescopes reveals a noticeable advantage of the former at fast focal ratio of the system.
"We establish well-posedness results for multidimensional non degenerate $\alpha$-stable driven SDEs with time inhomogeneous singular drifts in $\mathbb{L}^r-{\mathbb B}_{p,q}^{-1+\gamma}$ with $\gamma<1$ and $\alpha$ in $(1,2]$, where $\mathbb{L}^r$ and ${\mathbb B}_{p,q}^{-1+\gamma} $ stand for Lebesgue and Besov spaces respectively. Precisely, we first prove the well-posedness of the corresponding martingale problem and then give a precise meaning to the dynamics of the SDE. Our results rely on the smoothing properties of the underlying PDE, which is investigated by combining a perturbative approach with duality results between Besov spaces. "
"Non-linear sigma models that arise from the supersymmetric approach to disordered electron systems contain a non-compact bosonic sector. We study the model with target space H^2, the two-hyperboloid with isometry group SU(1,1), and prove that in three dimensions moments of the fields are finite in the thermodynamic limit. Thus the non-compact symmetry SU(1,1) is spontaneously broken. The bound on moments is compatible with the presence of extended states. "

"A search for direct production of C-even resonances a2(1320) and f2(1270) in e+e- annihilation was performed with SND detector at VEPP-2M e+e- collider. The upper limits of electronic widths of these mesons were obtained at 90% confidence level: Gamma(a2(1320) \to e+e-) < 0.56 eV, Gamma(f2(1270) \to e+e-) < 0.11 eV. "
"In the framework of the kt-factorization approach, we study the production of prompt photons associated with heavy (charm and beauty) quarks in hadron-hadron collisions at high energies. Our consideration is based on the amplitude for the production of a single photon associated with a quark pair in the fusion of two off-shell gluons. The total and differential cross sections are presented and the conservative error analysis is performed. Two sets of unintegrated gluon distributions in the proton have been used in numerical calculation: the one obtained from Ciafaloni-Catani-Fiorani-Marchesini evolution equation and the other from Kimber-Martin-Ryskin prescription. The theoretical results are compared with recent experimental data taken by the CDF collaboration at the Fermilab Tevatron. Our analysis extends to specific angular correlations between the produced prompt photons and muons originating from semileptonic decays of the final charmed or beauty quarks. We point out the importance of such observables, which can serve as a crucial test for the unintegrated gluon densities in a proton. Finally, we extrapolate the theoretical predictions to the CERN LHC energies. This paper is dedicated to the memory of P.F. Ermolov, who died on May 14, 2008. "
"We present a scenario for the formation and evolution of disk galaxies within the framework of an inflationary CDM universe, and we compare the results with observations ranking from the present-day up to z~1. Galactic disks are built-up inside-out by gas infall with accretion rates driven by the cosmological mass aggregation history (MAH). We generate the MAHs for a Gaussian density fluctuation field, and we calculate the gravitational collapse and virialization of the dark halos. Assuming detailed angular momentum conservation, disks in centrifugal equilibrium are built-up within them. The disk galactic evolution is followed through a physically self-consistent approach. The main disk galaxy properties and their correlations are determined by the mass, the MAH, and the spin parameter. The models give exponential disk surface brightness (SB) profiles with realistic parameters (including LSB galaxies), nearly flat rotation curves, and negative gradients in the B-V radial profile. The main trends across the Hubble sequence are reproduced. A maximum in the star formation rate for most of the models is attained at z~ 1.5-2.5 (this rate is approximately 2.5-4.0 times larger than the present one). The scale radii and the bulge-to-total ratios decrease with z, while the central SB increase. The B-band TF relation remains almost the same at different redshifts. Our scenario reveals that the cosmological initial conditions are able to determine the main properties of disk galaxies and predict evolutionary features for the present-day dominant galaxy population that are in agreement with very recent deep field observational studies.

"Given two genomes with duplicate genes, \textsc{Zero Exemplar Distance} is the problem of deciding whether the two genomes can be reduced to the same genome without duplicate genes by deleting all but one copy of each gene in each genome. Blin, Fertin, Sikora, and Vialette recently proved that \textsc{Zero Exemplar Distance} for monochromosomal genomes is NP-hard even if each gene appears at most two times in each genome, thereby settling an important open question on genome rearrangement in the exemplar model. In this paper, we give a very simple alternative proof of this result. We also study the problem \textsc{Zero Exemplar Distance} for multichromosomal genomes without gene order, and prove the analogous result that it is also NP-hard even if each gene appears at most two times in each genome. For the positive direction, we show that both variants of \textsc{Zero Exemplar Distance} admit polynomial-time algorithms if each gene appears exactly once in one genome and at least once in the other genome. In addition, we present a polynomial-time algorithm for the related problem \textsc{Exemplar Longest Common Subsequence} in the special case that each mandatory symbol appears exactly once in one input sequence and at least once in the other input sequence. This answers an open question of Bonizzoni et al. We also show that \textsc{Zero Exemplar Distance} for multichromosomal genomes without gene order is fixed-parameter tractable if the parameter is the maximum number of chromosomes in each genome. "
"We have computed the 15 microns integrated galaxy light produced by ISOCAM galaxies above a sensitivity limit of 50 microJy. It sets a lower limit to the 15 microns extragalactic background light of (2.4+/-0.5) nW/m^2/Hz. The redshift distribution of the ISOCAM galaxies is inferred from the spectroscopically complete sample of galaxies in the Hubble Deep Field North (HDFN). We demonstrate that mid (MIR) and far (FIR) infrared luminosities correlate for local star forming galaxies and that this correlation is consistent with the radio-FIR one up to z ~ 1. From these correlations, about 75 % of the ISOCAM galaxies are found to belong to the class of luminous infrared galaxies (L[IR] >= 10^11 Lsol), with star formation rates of the order of ~ 100 Msol/yr. The cross-correlation with the deepest X-ray surveys from the Chandra and XMM-Newton observatories in the HDFN and Lockman Hole respectively, indicates that at most 20 % of the 15 microns integrated galaxy light is due to active galactic nuclei (AGNs) unless a large population of AGNs was missed by Chandra and XMM-Newton. The contribution of ISOCAM galaxies to the peak of the cosmic infrared background (CIRB) at 140 microns was computed from the MIR-FIR correlations for star forming galaxies and from the spectral energy distribution of the Seyfert 2, NGC 1068, for AGNs. We find that the galaxies unveiled by ISOCAM surveys are responsible for the bulk of the CIRB, i.e (16+/-5) nW/m^2/Hz as compared to the (25+/-7) nW/m^2/Hz measured with the COBE satellite, with less than 10 % due to AGNs. Since the CIRB contains most of the light radiated over the history of star formation in the universe, this means that a large fraction of present-day stars must have formed during a dusty starburst event similar to those revealed by ISOCAM.

"We investigate the dynamics of a coupled waveguide system with competing linear and nonlinear loss-gain profiles which can facilitate power saturation. We show the usefulness of the model in achieving unidirectional beam propagation. In this regard, the considered type of coupled waveguide system has two drawbacks, (i) difficulty in achieving perfect isolation of light in a waveguide and (ii) existence of blow-up type behavior for certain input power situations. We here show a nonlinear $\cal{PT}$ symmetric coupling that helps to overcome these two drawbacks. Such a nonlinear coupling has close connection with the phenomenon of stimulated Raman scattering. In particular, we have elucidated the role of this nonlinear coupling using an integrable $\cal{PT}$ symmetric situation. In particular, using the integrals of motion, we have reduced this coupled waveguide problem to the problem of dynamics of a particle in a potential. With the latter picture, we have clearly illustrated the role of the considered nonlinear coupling. The above $\cal{PT}$ symmetric case corresponds to a limiting form of a general equation describing the phenomenon of stimulated Raman scattering. We also point out the ability to transport light unidirectionally even in this general case. "
"Since the discovery of low-ionization nuclear emission-line regions in many galaxies (LINERs), it has been recognized that they constitute a class of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) which are thought to be powered by gas accretion onto a central, supermassive black hole. LINERs are observed in approximately one third of galaxies in the local universe and it has been often thought that they harbor an AGN-like central engine with moderate activity. However, some LINERs show no direct evidence for AGNs such as broad emission lines, radio jets, hard X-ray emission, spectral energy distributions which are inconsistent with starlight, and so on. For such LINERs (a subset of type 2 LINERs), we present new poststarburst models which explain some of their most important optical narrow emission-line ratios. In these models, the ionization sources are planetary nebula nuclei (PNNs) with temperature of ~ 10^5 K which appear in the late-phase evolution of intermediate-mass stars with mass between ~ 3 M_solar and ~ 6 M_solar. Such PNNs left in a typical starburst nucleus can produce an Halpha luminosity of L(Halpha) ~ 10^38 ergs s^-1 for typical poststarburst LINERs and ~ 10^39 ergs s^-1 only in exceptionally bright cases. The PNN phase lasts until the death of the lowest-mass stars formed in the starburst, which is ~ 5 x 10^8 yr for an assumed lower limit of the initial mass function of 3 M_solar. This long duration appears consistent with the observed higher frequency of occurrence of LINERs if every galaxy could experience the starburst activity several times in its life. We therefore propose that some LINERs which show no direct evidence for AGNs may be poststarburst nuclei powered by a cluster of PNNs. "
"Far ultraviolet (FUV) observations are excellent probes of the inner accretion disk, disk outflows, and the mass-accumulating white dwarf in cataclysmic variables. Here we study the contrasting behavior of two canonical dwarf novae in outburst by presenting FUSE FUV (904 -- 1187 A) spectroscopy of U Gem and SS Cyg. We observed each system four times during a single outburst. The outburst peak and early decline spectra of SS Cyg are well fit by models of a steady-state accretion disk and a biconical wind. A broad, blueshifted OVI wind-formed absorption line is the only strong spectral feature. In late outburst decline, OVI and CIII lines are seen as broad emission features and the continuum has flattened. In U Gem, the continua of the optical outburst plateau spectra are plausibly fit by accretion disk model spectra. The spectra also show numerous narrow, low-velocity absorption lines that do not originate in the inner accretion disk. We discuss the line spectra in the context of partial absorption of the FUV continuum by low-velocity, vertically-extended material located at large disk radii. The late outburst decline spectrum of U Gem is dominated by the white dwarf. WD model fits confirm the sub-solar C and super-solar N abundances found in earlier studies. "

"We study experimentally the impulse response of a cylinder wake below the critical Reynolds number of the B\'enard-von K\'arm\'an instability. In this subcritical regime, a localized inhomogeneous region of convective instability exists which causes initial perturbations to be transiently amplified. The aim of this work is to quantify the evolution resulting from this convective instability using two-dimensional particle image velocimetry in a hydrodynamic tunnel experiment. The velocity fields allow us to describe the evolution of wave packets in terms of two control parameters: the Reynolds number and the magnitude of the imposed perturbation. The temporal evolution of energy exhibits a transient algebraic growth at short times followed by an exponential decay. "
"The gravitational instability of Yang-Mills cosmologies is numerically studied with the hamiltonian formulation of the spherically symmetric Einstein-Yang-Mills equations with SU(2) gauge group. On the short term, the expansion dilutes the energy densities of the Yang-Mills fluctuations due to their conformal invariance. In this early regime, the gauge potentials appear oscillating quietly in an interaction potential quite similar to the one of the homogeneous case. However, on the long term, the expansion finally becomes significantly inhomogeneous and no more mimics a conformal transformation of the metric. Thereafter, the Yang-Mills fluctuations enter a complex non-linear regime, accompanied by diffusion, while their associated energy contrasts grow. "
"In three-dimensional topological insulators (3D TI) nanowires, transport occurs via gapless surface states where the spin is fixed perpendicular to the momentum[1-6]. Carriers encircling the surface thus acquire a \pi Berry phase, which is predicted to open up a gap in the lowest-energy 1D surface subband. Inserting a magnetic flux ({\Phi}) of h/2e through the nanowire should cancel the Berry phase and restore the gapless 1D mode[7-8]. However, this signature has been missing in transport experiments reported to date[9-11]. Here, we report measurements of mechanically-exfoliated 3D TI nanowires which exhibit Aharonov-Bohm oscillations consistent with topological surface transport. The use of low-doped, quasi-ballistic devices allows us to observe a minimum conductance at {\Phi} = 0 and a maximum conductance reaching e^2/h at {\Phi} = h/2e near the lowest subband (i.e. the Dirac point), as well as the carrier density dependence of the transport. "
"We explore the landscape of technical naturalness for nonrelativistic systems, finding surprises which challenge and enrich our relativistic intuition already in the simplest case of a single scalar field. While the immediate applications are expected in condensed matter and perhaps in cosmology, the study is motivated by the leading puzzles of fundamental physics involving gravity: The cosmological constant problem and the Higgs mass hierarchy problem.

"Existing models for extractive summarization are usually trained from scratch with a cross-entropy loss, which does not explicitly capture the global context at the document level. In this paper, we aim to improve this task by introducing three auxiliary pre-training tasks that learn to capture the document-level context in a self-supervised fashion. Experiments on the widely-used CNN/DM dataset validate the effectiveness of the proposed auxiliary tasks. Furthermore, we show that after pre-training, a clean model with simple building blocks is able to outperform previous state-of-the-art that are carefully designed. "
"We show that for any fixed $\eps>0$, there are numbers $\delta>0$ and $p_0\ge 2$ with the following property: for every prime $p\ge p_0$ and every integer $N$ such that $p^{1/(4\sqrt{e})+\eps}\le N\le p$, the sequence $1,2,...,N$ contains at least $\delta N$ quadratic non-residues modulo $p$. We use this result to obtain strong upper bounds on the sizes of the least quadratic non-residues in Beatty and Piatetski--Shapiro sequences. "
"We present analytical estimates and numerical calculations showing that the energy level density in open-shell atoms increases exponentially with increase of excitation energy.

The result is used to estimate the effect of electrons on the nuclear transition which is considered for the use in a nuclear clock. "

"Although squaring integers is deterministic, squares modulo a prime, $p$, appear to be random. First, because they are all generated by the multiplicative linear congruential equation, $x_{i+1} = g^2 x_i \mod p$, where $x_0 = 1$ and $g$ is any primitive root of $p$, a pseudorandom number heuristic suggests that they are, in fact, unpredictable. Moreover, one type of cryptography makes use of discrete algorithms, which depends on the difficulty of solving $a = g^n$ for $n$ given $a$ and $g$. This suggests that the squares, which are exactly the even powers of $g$, are hard to identify. On the other hand, the Legendre symbol, $(a/p)$, which equals $1$ if a is a square modulo $p$ and $-1$ otherwise, has proven patterns. For example, $(ab/p) = (a/p)(b/p)$ holds true, and this shows that squares modulo $p$ have some structure. This paper considers the randomness of the following sequence: $(1/p), (2/p), ..., ((p-1)/p)$. Because it consists of binary data, the runs test is applied, which suggests that the number of runs is exactly (p-1)/2. This turns out to be a theorem proved by Aladov in 1896 that is not widely known. Consequently, this is an example of a number theory fact that is revealed naturally in a statistical setting, but one that has rarely been noted by mathematicians. "
"In this short article we introduce the mathematical framework of the principle of the fermionic projector and set up a variational principle in discrete space-time. The underlying physical principles are discussed. We outline the connection to the continuum theory and state recent results.

We study the finite temperature phase transition of four and two flavor staggered fermions with hypercubic smeared link actions. These preliminary studies suggest that the improved flavor symmetry of the fermionic action can have a significant effect on the finite temperature phase diagram.
"ABC-stacked trilayer graphene (TLG) are predicted to exhibit novel many-body phenomena due to the existence of almost dispersionless flat-band structures near the charge neutrality point (CNP). Here, using high magnetic field scanning tunneling microscopy, we present Landau Level (LL) spectroscopy measurements of high-quality ABC-stacked TLG. We observe an approximately linear magnetic-field-scaling of the valley splitting and orbital splitting in the ABC-stacked TLG. Our experiment indicates that the valley splitting decreases dramatically with increasing the LL index. When the lowest LL is partially filled, we find an obvious enhancement of the orbital splitting, attributing to strong many-body effects. Moreover, we observe linear energy scaling of the inverse lifetime of quasiparticles, providing an additional evidence for the strong electron-electron interactions in the ABC-stacked TLG. These results imply that interesting broken-symmetry states and novel electron correlation effects could emerge in the ABC-stacked TLG in the presence of high magnetic fields. "
"We have developed a variational perturbation theory based on the Liouville-Neumann equation, which enables one to systematically compute the perturbative correction terms to the variationally determined wave functions of the time-dependent systems. We then apply the method to the time-independent anharmonic oscillator, and show that the results agree with those of other variational perturbation theories. We also show that the system has an interesting algebraic structure at the first order correction level. "
"The oracle identification problem (OIP) was introduced by Ambainis et al. \cite{AIKMRY04}. It is given as a set $S$ of $M$ oracles and a blackbox oracle $f$. Our task is to figure out which oracle in $S$ is equal to the blackbox $f$ by making queries to $f$. OIP includes several problems such as the Grover Search as special cases. In this paper, we improve the algorithms in \cite{AIKMRY04} by providing a mostly optimal upper bound of query complexity for this problem: ($i$) For any oracle set $S$ such that $|S| \le 2^{N^d}$ ($d < 1$), we design an algorithm whose query complexity is $O(\sqrt{N\log{M}/\log{N}})$, matching the lower bound proved in \cite{AIKMRY04}. ($ii$) Our algorithm also works for the range between $2^{N^d}$ and $2^{N/\log{N}}$ (where the bound becomes O(N)), but the gap between the upper and lower bounds worsens gradually. ($iii$) Our algorithm is robust, namely, it exhibits the same performance (up to a constant factor) against the noisy oracles as also shown in the literatures \cite{AC02,BNRW03,HMW03} for special cases of OIP.

"Recent results in study of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model as the effective low energy theory give important hints for experimental search for supersymmetry. Also, in the bottom-up approach to explore weak scale - GUT scale connection, they constrain strongly physics at the GUT scale. Several theoretical ideas about the GUT physics are in stunning agreement with the low energy data. "
"We consider the orthogonal polynomials, $\{P_n(z)\}_{n=0,1,\cdots}$, with respect to the measure $$|z-a|^{2c} e^{-N|z|^2}dA(z)$$ supported over the whole complex plane, where $a>0$, $N>0$ and $c>-1$. We look at the scaling limit where $n$ and $N$ tend to infinity while keeping their ratio, $n/N$, fixed. The support of the limiting zero distribution is given in terms of certain ""limiting potential-theoretic skeleton"" of the unit disk. We show that, as we vary $c$, both the skeleton and the asymptotic distribution of the zeros behave discontinuously at $c=0$. The smooth interpolation of the discontinuity is obtained by the further scaling of $c=e^{-\eta N}$ in terms of the parameter $\eta\in[0,\infty).$ "
"The phenomenon of Coulombic friction enters the stochastic description of dry friction between two solids and the statistic characterization of vibrating granular media. Here we analyze the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation including both velocity and spatial components, exhibiting a formal connection to a quantum mechanical harmonic oscillator in the presence of a delta potential. Numerical solutions for the resulting spatial displacement statistics show a crossover from exponential to Gaussian displacement statistics. We identify a transient intermediate regime that exhibits multiscaling properties arising from the contribution of Coulombic friction. The possible role of these effects during observations in diffusion experiments is shortly discussed. "
"The waves of fermions display nonlocality in low energy limit of quantum fields. In this \QTR{it}{ab initio} paper we propose a complex-geometry model that reveals the affection of nonlocality on the interaction between material particles of spin-1/2. To make nonlocal properties appropriately involved in a quantum theory, the special unitary group SU(n) and spinor representation $D^{(1/2,1/2)}$ of Lorentz group are generalized by making complex spaces--which are spanned by wave functions of quantum particles--curved. The curved spaces are described by the geometry used in General Relativity by replacing the real space with complex space and additionally imposing the analytic condition on the space. The field equations for fermions and for bosons are respectively associated with geodesic motion equations and with local curvature of the considered space. The equation for fermions can restore all the terms of quadratic form of Dirac equation. According to the field equation it is found that, for the U(1) field [generalized Quantum Electrodynamics (QED)], when the electromagnetic fields $\vec E$ and $\vec B$ satisfy $\vec E^2-\vec B^2\neq 0$, the bosons will gain masses. In this model, a physical region is empirically defined, which can be characterized by a determinant occurring in boson field equation. Applying the field equation to U(3) field [generalized Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD)], the quark-confining property can be understood by carrying out the boundary of physical region. "
"For some theories where the degrees of freedom are tensors of rank $3$ or higher, there exist solvable large $N$ limits dominated by the melonic diagrams. Simple examples are provided by models containing one rank-$3$ tensor in the tri-fundamental representation of the $O(N)^3$ symmetry group. When the quartic interaction is assumed to have a special tetrahedral index structure, the coupling constant $g$ must be scaled as $N^{-3/2}$ in the melonic large $N$ limit. In this paper we consider the combinatorics of a large $N$ theory of one fully symmetric and traceless rank-$3$ tensor with the tetrahedral quartic interaction; this model has a single $O(N)$ symmetry group. We explicitly calculate all the vacuum diagrams up to order $g^8$, as well as some diagrams of higher order, and find that in the large $N$ limit where $g^2 N^3$ is held fixed only the melonic diagrams survive. While some non-melonic diagrams are enhanced in the $O(N)$ symmetric theory compared to the $O(N)^3$ one, we have not found any diagrams where this enhancement is strong enough to make them comparable with the melonic ones. Motivated by these results, we conjecture that the model of a real rank-$3$ symmetric traceless tensor possesses a smooth large $N$ limit where $g^2 N^3$ is held fixed and all the contributing diagrams are melonic. A feature of the symmetric traceless tensor models is that some vacuum diagrams containing odd numbers of vertices are suppressed only by $N^{-1/2}$ relative to the melonic graphs. "
"In this paper, we will propose that magnetic-resonance nanostructures in a metal surface could be used to realize extraordinary optical transmission (EOT). Toward this goal, we designed and fabricated a one dimensional diatomic chain of slit-hole resonator (SHR). Due to the strong exchange current interaction, a type of magnetic plasmon (MP) propagation mode with a broad frequency bandwidth was established in this system. Apparent EOT peaks induced by the MP mode were observed in our measured spectra at infrared frequencies. The strongest EOT peak was obtained at 1.07 eV with an incident angle of 20 degree. The measured dependence of EOT peaks on the incident angle coincided with the theoretical results quite well. This proposed MP propagation mode in SHR structure has good potential applications in multifrequency nonlinear optical processes. "
"We report measurement of the semi-inclusive distribution of charged-particle jets recoiling from a high transverse momentum ($p_{\rm T}$) hadron trigger, for p-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}} = 5.02$ TeV, in p-Pb events classified by event activity. This observable has been measured in pp and Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC, providing a new probe to measure quenching. Jets are reconstructed from charged particle tracks using anti-$k_{\rm t}$ with $R = 0.4$ and low IR cutoff of jet constituents ($p_{\rm T,track} > 0.15$ GeV/$c$). The complex uncorrelated jet background is corrected by a data-driven approach. Recoil jet distributions are reported for $15 < p_{\rm T,jet}^{\rm ch} < 50$ GeV/$c$. Events are classified by signal in the ALICE V0A detector, which measures forward multiplicity, and ZNA, which measures the number of neutrons at zero degrees. This self-normalized observable does not require scaling of reference distributions by $T_{\rm pA}$ , thereby avoiding the need for geometric modeling. We compare the trigger-normalized recoil jet yield for p-Pb collisions with different event activity to measure the effects of jet quenching in small systems at the LHC. "
"For a connected graph, the distance spectral radius is the largest eigenvalue of its distance matrix. In this paper, of all trees with both given order and fixed diameter, the trees with the minimal distance spectral radius are completely characterized. "
"We develop a stochastic approach to time-dependent DFT with optimally-tuned range-separated hybrids containing non-local exchange, for calculating optical spectra. The attractive electron-hole interaction, which leads to the formation of excitons, is included through a time-dependent linear-response technique with a non-local exchange interaction which is computed very efficiently through a stochastic scheme. The method is inexpensive and scales quadratically with the number of electrons, at almost the same (low) cost of time dependent Kohn-Sham (TDKS) with local functionals. Our results are in excellent agreement with experimental data and the efficiency of the approach is demonstrated on large finite phosphorene sheets containing up to 1958 valence electrons. "
"The cosmological Slavnov-Taylor (ST) identity of the Einstein-Hilbert action coupled to a single inflaton field is obtained from the Becchi-Rouet-Stora-Tyutin (BRST) symmetry associated with diffeomorphism invariance in the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner (ADM) formalism. The consistency conditions between the correlators of the scalar and tensor modes in the squeezed limit are then derived from the ST identity, together with the softly broken conformal symmetry. Maldacena's original relations connecting the 2- and 3-point correlators at horizon crossing are recovered, as well as the next-to-leading corrections, controlled by the special conformal transformations. "
"Consider the unnormalized Ricci flow $(g_{ij})_t = -2R_{ij}$ for $t\in [0,T)$, where $T < \infty$. Richard Hamilton showed that if the curvature operator is uniformly bounded under the flow for all times $t\in [0,T)$ then the solution can be extended beyond $T$. We prove that if the Ricci curvature is uniformly bounded under the flow for all times $t\in [0,T)$, then the curvature tensor has to be uniformly bounded as well. "
"For lensing galaxies we introduce a formal velocity dispersion sigma_lens, based on enclosed mass and the virial theorem. This is calculated from an ensemble of pixelated lens models, and found to be fairly model independent. A sample of 18 well-known early-type lensing galaxies and two clusters is found to be consistent with the equality of sigma_lens and the kinematic velocity dispersion sigma_obs. Both the early-type lensing galaxies and the clusters can thus be determined as being virialized. In a second step we calculate the I-band luminosity and the total mass content for the sample of lensing galaxies, which enables us to analyze the mass-to-light relation L ~ M^a. We determine a = 0.70 +/- 0.08, excluding constant M/L and consistent with previous studies of the Fundamental Plane. Additionally we verify that this relation does not extrapolate to clusters, which have a much higher M/L. The sample used for this analysis comprises 9 lensing galaxies from the Sloan Lens ACS Survey (SLACS) and another 9 from the CfA-Arizona Space Telescope LEns Survey (CASTLES) as well as the lensing clusters ACO 1689 and ACO 2667. "
"Classical scale invariance (CSI) may be one of the solutions for the hierarchy problem. Realistic models for electroweak symmetry breaking based on CSI require extended scalar sectors without mass terms, and the electroweak symmetry is broken dynamically at the quantum level by the Coleman-Weinberg mechanism. We discuss discriminative features of these models. First, using the experimental value of the mass of the discovered Higgs boson $h(125)$, we obtain an upper bound on the mass of the lightest additional scalar boson (~543 GeV), which does not depend on its isospin and hypercharge. Second, a discriminative prediction on the Higgs-photon-photon coupling is given as a function of the number of charged scalar bosons, by which we can narrow down possible models using current and future data for the di-photon decay of $h(125)$. Finally, for the triple Higgs boson coupling a large deviation (~ +70 %) from the SM prediction is universally predicted, which is independent of masses, quantum numbers and even the number of additional scalars. These models based on CSI can be well tested at LHC Run II and at future lepton colliders. "
"A basic result is that the sample variance for i.i.d. observations is an unbiased estimator of the variance of the underlying distribution (see for instance Casella and Berger (2002)). But what happens if the observations are neither independent nor identically distributed. What can we say? Can we in particular compute explicitly the first two moments of the sample mean and hence generalize formulae provided in Tukey (1957a), Tukey (1957b) for the first two moments of the sample variance? We also know that the sample mean and variance are independent if they are computed on an i.i.d. normal distribution. This is one of the underlying assumption to derive the Student distribution Student alias W. S. Gosset (1908). But does this result hold for any other underlying distribution? Can we still have independent sample mean and variance if the distribution is not normal? This paper precisely answers these questions and extends previous work of Cho, Cho, and Eltinge (2004). We are able to derive a general formula for the first two moments and variance of the sample variance under no specific assumption. We also provide a faster proof of a seminal result of Lukacs (1942) by using the log characteristic function of the unbiased sample variance estimator. "
"5G systems aim to achieve extremely high data rates, low end-to-end latency and ultra-low power consumption. Recently, there has been considerable interest in the design of 5G physical layer waveforms. One important candidate is Generalised Frequency Division Multiplexing (GFDM). In order to evaluate its performance and features, system-level studies should be undertaken in a range of scenarios. These studies, however, require highly complex computations if they are performed using bit-level simulators. In this paper, the Mutual Information (MI) based link quality model (PHY abstraction), which has been regularly used to implement system-level studies for Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM), is applied to GFDM. The performance of the GFDM waveform using this model and the bit-level simulation performance is measured using different channel types. Moreover, a system-level study for a GFDM based LTE-A system in a realistic scenario, using both a bit-level simulator and this abstraction model, has been studied and compared. The results reveal the accuracy of this model using realistic channel data. Based on these results, the PHY abstraction technique can be applied to evaluate the performance of GFDM based systems in an effective manner with low complexity. The maximum difference in the Packet Error Rate (PER) and throughput results in the abstraction case compared to bit-level simulation does not exceed 4% whilst offering a simulation time saving reduction of around 62,000 times. "
In this paper we point out that Starobinky inflation could be induced by quantum effects due to a large non-minimal coupling of the Higgs boson to the Ricci scalar. The Higgs Starobinsky mechanism provides a solution to issues attached to large Higgs field values in the early universe which in a metastable universe would not be a viable option. We verify explicitly that these large quantum corrections do not destabilize Starobinsky's potential.
"The excessive compensation packages of CEOs of U.S. corporations in recent years have brought to the foreground the issue of fairness in economics. The conventional wisdom is that the free market for labor, which determines the pay packages, cares only about efficiency and not fairness. We present an alternative theory that shows that an ideal free market environment also promotes fairness, as an emergent property resulting from the self-organizing market dynamics. Even though an individual employee may care only about his or her salary and no one else's, the collective actions of all the employees, combined with the profit maximizing actions of all the companies, in a free market environment under budgetary constraints, lead towards a more fair allocation of wages, guided by Adam Smith's invisible hand of self-organization. By exploring deep connections with statistical thermodynamics, we show that entropy is the appropriate measure of fairness in a free market environment which is maximized at equilibrium to yield the lognormal distribution of salaries as the fairest inequality of pay in an organization under ideal conditions. "
"We study the multifield inflationary models where the cosmological perturbation is sourced by light scalar fields other than the inflaton. We exploit the operator product expansion and partly the symmetries present during the de Sitter epoch to characterize the non-Gaussian four-point correlator in the squeezed limit. We point out that the contribution to it from the intrinsic non-Gaussianity of the light fields at horizon crossing can be larger than the usually studied contribution arising on superhorizon scales and it comes with a different shape. Our findings indicate that particular attention needs to be taken when studying the effects of the primordial NG on real observables, such as the clustering of dark matter halos. "
"We use simulated merger trees of galaxy-cluster halos to study the effect of the halo concentration distribution on strong lensing and X-ray emission. Its log-normal shape typically found in simulations favors outliers with high concentration. Since, at fixed mass, more concentrated halos tend to be more efficient lenses, the scatter in the concentration increases the strong-lensing optical depth by $\lesssim50%$. Within cluster samples, mass and concentration have counteracting effects on strong lensing and X-ray emission because the concentration decreases for increasing mass. Selecting clusters by concentration thus has no effect on the lensing cross section. The most efficiently lensing and hottest clusters are typically the \textit{least} concentrated in samples with a broad mass range. Among cluster samples with a narrow mass range, however, the most strongly lensing and X-ray brightest clusters are typically 10% to 25% more concentrated. "
"Strong interaction between two single photons is a long standing and important goal in quantum photonics. This would enable a new regime of nonlinear optics and unlock several applications in quantum information science, including photonic quantum gates and deterministic Bell-state measurements. In the context of quantum networks, it would be important to achieve interactions between single photons from independent photon pairs storable in quantum memories. So far, most experiments showing nonlinearities at the single-photon level have used weak classical input light. Here, we demonstrate the storage and retrieval of a paired single photon emitted by an ensemble quantum memory in a strongly nonlinear medium based on highly excited Rydberg atoms. We show that nonclassical correlations between the two photons persist after retrieval from the Rydberg ensemble. Our result is an important step towards deterministic photon-photon interactions, and may enable deterministic Bell-state measurements with multimode quantum memories. "
We show that the anomalous diffusion equations with a fractional derivative in the Caputo or Riesz sense are strictly related to the special convolution properties of the L\'evy stable distributions which stem from the evolution properties of stretched or compressed exponential function. The formal solutions of these fractional differential equations are found by using the evolution operator method where the evolution operator is presented as integral transforms whose kernel is the Green function. Exact and explicit examples of the solutions are reported and studied for various fractional order of derivatives and different initial conditions.
"We develop the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) formalism for the superconductivity of carbon nanotubes. It is found that the superconducting transition temperature Tc of single-wall carbon nanotubes decreases exponentially with the increase of the tube diameter because the density of states near the Fermi energy is inversely proportional to the tube diameter. For the multi-wall carbon nanotubes, the Cooper paring hopping between layers enhances the superconducting correlation and increases the superconducting transition temperature, which is consistent with the experimental observation.

"Using the Cantero-Grunbaum-Moral-Velazquez (CGMV) method, we obtain the spectral measure for the quantum walk. "
"[Taken from the ""README"" in the book] My goal with this book is to provide some kind of bridge for mathematics between the high-school-level and college-level for physics students. From my perspective, our job as physicists is to observe and understand the universe around us. Unfortunately our universe happens to be pretty complicated, at least from a mathematical point-of-view. However, a lot of the underlying physics | the underlying set of rules surrounding how things move and behave | is usually not too complicated. Sure, when we couple things together, everything turns disgusting, and we need to turn to really powerful computers or simulators to get a lot accomplished. But the basic rules are not that bad. My hope is to provide enough of a conceptual framework for you to learn to $read$ math as I saw a lot of other physicists do when I started my undergraduate career. I plan to cover some of the topics that tend to trip up a lot of physics students, although I could not cover these exhaustively. When I found that I should have covered more, but could not due to finite time constraints, I left a reference to other work that I think you may find helpful. However, unlike a lot of works, my focus is to help modify your thinking of how math is used, rather than just pummel you with algorithms for you to memorize without giving you the proper context for such algorithms. Whenever you find my explanations long-winded, feel free to proceed through faster. If you get stuck, you are always free to go back and see what I might have referenced before. "
"The generalized labeled multi-Bernoulli (GLMB) is a family of tractable models that alleviates the limitations of the Poisson family in dynamic Bayesian inference of point processes. In this paper, we derive closed form expressions for the void probability functional and the Cauchy-Schwarz divergence for GLMBs. The proposed analytic void probability functional is a necessary and sufficient statistic that uniquely characterizes a GLMB, while the proposed analytic Cauchy-Schwarz divergence provides a tractable measure of similarity between GLMBs. We demonstrate the use of both results on a partially observed Markov decision process for GLMBs, with Cauchy-Schwarz divergence based reward, and void probability constraint. "
"Hybrid systems of excitons strongly coupled to localized surface plasmons supported by metallic nanoparticles define a new approach to control light-matter interactions. Here, we report exciton-plasmon coupling in two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors, such as MoS2 and WS2, hybridized with silver nanoparticles. Prominent photoluminescence enhancement in monolayer MoS2 was observed with localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) tuned to the exciton resonance. By tuning the excitation energy, the contributions from near field enhancement and radiative emission rate enhancement via Purcell effect were resolved. Strong coherent dipole-dipole coupling between excitons and LSPR in resonant condition manifests as an electromagnetically induced transparency window in the extinction spectra of the localized surface plasmon. In this strong coupling regime a new quasi-particle, known as a plexciton, is expected to exhibit distinct properties, which exist in neither of the original particles. Our results demonstrate that 2D semiconductors hybridized with plasmonic structures not only hold great promise in the applications of energy-harvesting and light-emitting devices, but also provide an attractive platform for fundamental investigations of exciton-plasmon interactions in the strong coupling regime. "
"Systematic investigations of the structural and magnetic properties of single crystal (Ga,Mn)N films grown by metal organic vapor phase epitaxy are presented. High resolution transmission electron microscopy, synchrotron x-ray diffraction, and extended x-ray absorption fine structure studies do not reveal any crystallographic phase separation and indicate that Mn occupies Ga-substitutional sites in the Mn concentration range up to 1%. The magnetic properties as a function of temperature, magnetic field and its orientation with respect to the c-axis of the wurtzite structure can be quantitatively described by the paramagnetic theory of an ensemble of non-interacting Mn$^{3+}$ ions in the relevant crystal field, a conclusion consistent with the x-ray absorption near edge structure analysis. A negligible contribution of Mn in the 2+ charge state points to a low concentration of residual donors in the studied films. Studies on modulation doped p-type (Ga,Mn)N/(Ga,Al)N:Mg heterostructures do not reproduce the high temperature robust ferromagnetism reported recently for this system. "
"Semi-supervised learning is an important and active topic of research in pattern recognition. For classification using linear discriminant analysis specifically, several semi-supervised variants have been proposed. Using any one of these methods is not guaranteed to outperform the supervised classifier which does not take the additional unlabeled data into account. In this work we compare traditional Expectation Maximization type approaches for semi-supervised linear discriminant analysis with approaches based on intrinsic constraints and propose a new principled approach for semi-supervised linear discriminant analysis, using so-called implicit constraints. We explore the relationships between these methods and consider the question if and in what sense we can expect improvement in performance over the supervised procedure. The constraint based approaches are more robust to misspecification of the model, and may outperform alternatives that make more assumptions on the data, in terms of the log-likelihood of unseen objects. "
"The densest binary sphere packings in the alpha-x plane of small to large sphere radius ratio alpha and small sphere relative concentration x have historically been very difficult to determine. Previous research had led to the prediction that these packings were composed of a few known ""alloy"" phases including, for example, the AlB2 (hexagonal omega), HgBr2, and AuTe2 structures, and to XYn structures composed of close-packed large spheres with small spheres (in a number ratio of n to 1) in the interstices, e.g., the NaCl packing for n = 1. However, utilizing an implementation of the Torquato-Jiao sphere-packing algorithm [S. Torquato and Y. Jiao, Phys. Rev. E 82, 061302 (2010)], we have discovered that many more structures appear in the densest packings. For example, while all previously known densest structures were composed of spheres in small to large number ratios of one to one, two to one, and very recently three to one, we have identified densest structures with number ratios of seven to three and five to two. In a recent work [A. B. Hopkins, Y. Jiao, F. H. Stillinger, and S. Torquato, Phys. Rev. Lett. 107, 125501 (2011)], we summarized these findings. In this work, we present the structures of the densest-known packings and provide details about their characteristics. Our findings demonstrate that a broad array of different densest mechanically stable structures consisting of only two types of components can form without any consideration of attractive or anisotropic interactions. In addition, the novel structures that we have identified may correspond to currently unidentified stable phases of certain binary atomic and molecular systems, particularly at high temperatures and pressures.

"Cavitation is a limiting phenomenon in many domains of fluid mechanics. Instabilities of a partial cavity developed on an hydrofoil, a converging-diverging step or in an inter-blade channel in turbomachinery, have already been investigated and described in many previous works. The aim of this study is to evaluate a passive control method of the sheet cavity. According to operating conditions, cavitation can be described by two different regimes: an unstable regime with a cloud cavitation shedding and a stable regime with only a pulsating sheet cavity. Avoiding cloud cavitation can limit structure damages since a pulsating sheet cavity is less agressive. The surface condition of a converging-diverging step, like a Venturi-type obstacle, is here studied as a solution for a passive control of the cavitation. This study discusses the effect of an organized roughness, in the shape of longitudinal grooves, on the developed sheet cavity. Analyzes conducted with Laser Doppler Velocimetry, visualisations and pressure measurements show that the grooves geometry, and especially the groove depth, acts on the sheet cavity dynamics. Results show that modifying the surface condition, by varying the grooves geometry, can reduce cavity sheet length and even suppress the cloud cavitation shedding. "
"We establish a Pontryagin maximum principle for discrete time optimal control problems under the following three types of constraints: a) constraints on the states pointwise in time, b) constraints on the control actions pointwise in time, and c) constraints on the frequency spectrum of the optimal control trajectories. While the first two types of constraints are already included in the existing versions of the Pontryagin maximum principle, it turns out that the third type of constraints cannot be recast in any of the standard forms of the existing results for the original control system. We provide two different proofs of our Pontryagin maximum principle in this article, and include several special cases fine-tuned to control-affine nonlinear and linear system models. In particular, for minimization of quadratic cost functions and linear time invariant control systems, we provide tight conditions under which the optimal controls under frequency constraints are either normal or abnormal.

"Using strong-disorder renormalization group, numerical exact diagonalization, and quantum Monte Carlo methods, we revisit the random antiferromagnetic XXZ spin-1/2 chain focusing on the long-length and ground-state behavior of the average time-independent spin-spin correlation function C(l)=\upsilon l^{-\eta}. In addition to the well-known universal (disorder-independent) power-law exponent \eta=2, we find interesting universal features displayed by the prefactor \upsilon=\upsilon_o/3, if l is odd, and \upsilon=\upsilon_e/3, otherwise. Although \upsilon_o and \upsilon_e are nonuniversal (disorder dependent) and distinct in magnitude, the combination \upsilon_o + \upsilon_e = -1/4 is universal if C is computed along the symmetric (longitudinal) axis. The origin of the nonuniversalities of the prefactors is discussed in the renormalization-group framework where a solvable toy model is considered. Moreover, we relate the average correlation function with the average entanglement entropy, whose amplitude has been recently shown to be universal. The nonuniversalities of the prefactors are shown to contribute only to surface terms of the entropy. Finally, we discuss the experimental relevance of our results by computing the structure factor whose scaling properties, interestingly, depend on the correlation prefactors. "
"TMAC is a toolbox written in C++11 that implements algorithms based on a set of modern methods for large-scale optimization. It covers a variety of optimization problems, which can be both smooth and nonsmooth, convex and nonconvex, as well as constrained and unconstrained. The algorithms implemented in TMAC, such as the coordinate up- date method and operator splitting method, are scalable as they decompose a problem into simple subproblems. These algorithms can run in a multi-threaded fashion, either synchronously or asynchronously, to take advantages of all the cores available. TMAC architecture mimics how a scientist writes down an optimization algorithm. Therefore, it is easy for one to obtain a new algorithm by making simple modifications such as adding a new operator and adding a new splitting, while maintaining the multicore parallelism and other features. The package is available at https://github.com/uclaopt/TMAC. "
"If a homogeneous plane light-like shell collides head-on with a homogeneous plane electromagnetic shock wave having a step-function profile then no backscattered gravitational waves are produced. We demonstrate, by explicit calculation, that if the matter is accompanied by a homogeneous plane electromagnetic shock wave with a step-function profile then backscattered gravitational waves appear after the collision. "
"We perform a multi-parameter global analysis of all data available till date from the ATLAS, CMS and Tevatron experiments, on the signals of a Higgs boson, to investigate how much scope exists for departure from the standard model prediction. We adopt a very general and model-independent scenario, where separate deviations from standard model values are possible for couplings of the observed scalar with up-and down-type fermions, W-and Z-boson pairs, as well as gluon and photon pair effective interactions. An arbitrary phase in the coupling with the top-pair, and the provision for an invisible decay width for the scalar are also introduced. After performing a global fit with seven parameters, we find that their values at 95% confidence level can be considerably different from standard model expectations. Moreover, rather striking implications of the phase in top-quark coupling are noticed. We also note that the invisible branching ratio can be sizeable, especially when the couplings of the Higgs to W-and Z-pairs are allowed to be different. "
"Lord Kelvin with his discovery of the anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR) phenomenon in Ni and Fe was 70 years ahead of the formulation of relativistic quantum mechanics the effect stems from, and almost one and a half century ahead of spintronics whose first commercial applications relied on the AMR. Despite the long history and importance in magnetic sensing and memory technologies, the microscopic understanding of the AMR has struggled to go far beyond the basic notion of a relativistic magnetotransport phenomenon arising from combined effects on diffusing carriers of spin-orbit coupling and broken symmetry of a metallic ferromagnet. Our work demonstrates that even this seemingly generic notion of the AMR phenomenon needs revisiting as we observe the ohmic AMR effect in a nano-scale film of an antiferromagnetic (AFM) semiconductor Sr2IrO4 (SIO). Our work opens the recently proposed path for integrating semiconducting and spintronic technologies in AFMs. SIO is a particularly favorable material for exploring this path since its semiconducting nature is entangled with the AFM order and strong spin-orbit coupling. For the observation of the low-field Ohmic AMR in SIO we prepared an epitaxial heterostructure comprising a nano-scale SIO film on top of an epilayer of a FM metal La2/3Sr1/3MnO3 (LSMO). This allows the magnetic field control of the orientation of AFM spins in SIO via the exchange spring effect at the FM-AFM interface. "
"Machine Translation is the translation of one natural language into another using automated and computerized means. For a multilingual country like India, with the huge amount of information exchanged between various regions and in different languages in digitized format, it has become necessary to find an automated process from one language to another. In this paper, we take a look at the various Machine Translation System in India which is specifically built for the purpose of translation between the Indian languages. We discuss the various approaches taken for building the machine translation system and then discuss some of the Machine Translation Systems in India along with their features. "
We investigate the possible total radiated energy produced by a binary black hole system containing non-vanishing total angular momentum. For the scenearios considered we find that the total radiated energy does not exceed 1%. Additionally we explore the gravitational radiation field and the variation of angular momentum in the process.
"The ALMA SPECtroscopic Survey in the {\it Hubble} Ultra Deep Field is an ALMA large program that obtained a frequency scan in the 3\,mm band to detect emission lines from the molecular gas in distant galaxies. We here present our search strategy for emission lines and continuum sources in the HUDF. We compare several line search algorithms used in the literature, and critically account for the line-widths of the emission line candidates when assessing significance. We identify sixteen emission lines at high fidelity in our search. Comparing these sources to multi-wavelength data we find that all sources have optical/infrared counterparts. Our search also recovers candidates that have lower significance that can be used statistically to derive, e.g. the CO luminosity function. We apply the same detection algorithm to obtain a sample of six 3 mm continuum sources. All of these are also detected in the 1.2 mm continuum with optical/near-infrared counterparts. We use the continuum sources to compute 3 mm number counts in the sub-mJy regime, and find them to be higher by an order of magnitude than expected for synchrotron-dominated sources. However, the number counts are consistent with those derived at shorter wavelengths (0.85--1.3\,mm) once extrapolating to 3\,mm with a dust emissivity index of $\beta=1.5$, dust temperature of 35\,K and an average redshift of $z=2.5$. These results represent the best constraints to date on the faint end of the 3 mm number counts. "
"Our purpose in this paper is to apply some maximum principles in order to study the rigidity of complete spacelike hypersurfaces immersed in a spatially weighted generalized Robertson-Walker (GRW) spacetime, which is supposed to obey the so called strong null convergence condition. Under natural constraints on the weight function and on the f-mean curvature, we establish sufficient conditions to guarantee that such a hypersurface must be a slice of the ambient space. In this setting, we also obtain new Calabi-Bernstein type results concerning entire graphs in a spatially weighted GRW spacetime. "
"We model the evolution of the mean galaxy occupation of dark-matter halos over the range $0.1<z<1.3$, using the data from the VIMOS-VLT Deep Survey (VVDS). The galaxy projected correlation function $w_p(r_p)$ was computed for a set of luminosity-limited subsamples and fits to its shape were obtained using two variants of Halo Occupation Distribution models. These provide us with a set of best-fitting parameters, from which we obtain the average mass of a halo and average number of galaxies per halo. We find that after accounting for the evolution in luminosity and assuming that we are largely following the same population, the underlying dark matter halo shows a growth in mass with decreasing redshift as expected in a hierarchical structure formation scenario. Using two different HOD models, we see that the halo mass grows by 90% over the redshift interval z=[0.5,1.0]. This is the first time the evolution in halo mass at high redshifts has been obtained from a single data survey and it follows the simple form seen in N-body simulations with $M(z) = M_0 e^{-\beta z}$, and $\beta = 1.3 \pm 0.30$. This provides evidence for a rapid accretion phase of massive halos having a present-day mass $M_0 \sim 10^{13.5} h^{-1} M_\odot$, with a $m > 0.1 M_0$ merger event occuring between redshifts of 0.5 and 1.0. Futhermore, we find that more luminous galaxies are found to occupy more massive halos irrespectively of the redshift. Finally, the average number of galaxies per halo shows little increase from redshift z$\sim$ 1.0 to z$\sim$ 0.5, with a sharp increase by a factor $\sim$3 from z$\sim$ 0.5 to z$\sim$ 0.1, likely due to the dynamical friction of subhalos within their host halos. "
"We report on precise measurements of absolute nonlinear ionization probabilities obtained by exposing optically trapped ultracold rubidium atoms to the field of an ultrashort laser pulse in the intensity range of $1 \times 10^{11}$ to $4 \times 10^{13}$ W/cm$^2$. The experimental data are in perfect agreement with ab-initio theory, based on solving the time-dependent Schr\""odinger equation without any free parameters. Ultracold targets allow to retrieve absolute probabilities since ionized atoms become apparent as a local vacancy imprinted into the target density, which is recorded simultaneously. We study the strong-field response of $^{87}$Rb atoms at two different wavelengths representing non-resonant and resonant processes in the demanding regime where the Keldysh parameter is close to unity. "
"We present a unified analysis of the decays of bottomonia Upsilon(mS) -> Upsilon(nS) pi pi (m>n, m=2,3,4,5, n=1,2,3), charmonia J/psi -> phi (pi pi, K antiK), psi(2S) -> J/psi pi pi and the isoscalar S-wave processes pi pi -> pi pi, K antiK, eta eta. In this analysis we extend our recent study of low-lying (m=2,3) radial excitations of bottomonia to modes involving higher (m=4,5) excited states. Similarly as for the data on lower radial excitations, we confirm that the data for higher radially excited states from the BaBar and Belle collaborations can be described under conditions that the final bottomonium is a spectator and the multichannel pi pi scattering is considered in a model-independent approach based on analyticity, unitarity and the uniformization procedure. Indeed we show that the dipion mass distributions in the two-pion transitions of both charmonia and bottomonia states are explained by a unified mechanism based on the contribution of the pi pi and K antiK coupled channels including their interference (final-state interactions). Therefore, our main result is that the lower and higher radially excited states of charmonia and bottomonia have no specific features in mutual comparison and can be understood in a unified picture, e.g. proposed by our approach.

"The capacity region of multi-pair bidirectional relay networks, in which a relay node facilitates the communication between multiple pairs of users, is studied. This problem is first examined in the context of the linear shift deterministic channel model. The capacity region of this network when the relay is operating at either full-duplex mode or half-duplex mode for arbitrary number of pairs is characterized. It is shown that the cut-set upper-bound is tight and the capacity region is achieved by a so called divide-and-conquer relaying strategy. The insights gained from the deterministic network are then used for the Gaussian bidirectional relay network. The strategy in the deterministic channel translates to a specific superposition of lattice codes and random Gaussian codes at the source nodes and successive interference cancelation at the receiving nodes for the Gaussian network. The achievable rate of this scheme with two pairs is analyzed and it is shown that for all channel gains it achieves to within 3 bits/sec/Hz per user of the cut-set upper-bound. Hence, the capacity region of the two-pair bidirectional Gaussian relay network to within 3 bits/sec/Hz per user is characterized. "
"One growing use of computer-based communication media is for gathering people to initiate or sustain social events. Although the use of computer-mediated communication and social network sites such as Facebook for event promotion is becoming popular, online participation in an event does not always translate to offline attendance. In this paper, we report on an interview study of 31 participants that examines how people handle online event invitations and what influences their online and offline participation. The results show that people's event participation is shaped by their social perceptions of the event's nature (e.g., public or private), their relationships to others (e.g., the strength of their connections to other invitees), and the medium used to communicate event information (e.g., targeted invitation via email or spam communication via Facebook event page). By exploring how people decide whether to participate online or offline, the results illuminate the sophisticated nature of the mechanisms that affect participation and have design implications that can bridge virtual and real attendance.

"We present a dispersion relation in the pion-mass squared, which static quantities (nucleon mass, magnetic moment, etc.) obey under the assumption of analyticity in the entire complex $m_\pi^2$ plane modulo a cut at negative $m_\pi^2$ associated with pion production. The relation is verified here in a number of examples of nucleon and $\Delta$-isobar properties computed in chiral perturbation theory up to order $p^3$. We outline a method to obtain relations for other mass-dependencies, and illustrate it on a two-loop example. "
"Rapid miniaturization and cost reduction of computing, along with the availability of wearable and implantable physiological sensors have led to the growth of human Body Area Network (BAN) formed by a network of such sensors and computing devices. One promising application of such a network is wearable health monitoring where the collected data from the sensors would be transmitted and analyzed to assess the health of a person. Typically, the devices in a BAN are connected through wireless (WBAN), which suffers from energy inefficiency due to the high-energy consumption of wireless transmission. Human Body Communication (HBC) uses the relatively low loss human body as the communication medium to connect these devices, promising order(s) of magnitude better energy-efficiency and built-in security compared to WBAN. In this paper, we demonstrate a health monitoring device and system built using Commercial-Off-The- Shelf (COTS) sensors and components, that can collect data from physiological sensors and transmit it through a) intra-body HBC to another device (hub) worn on the body or b) upload health data through HBC-based human-machine interaction to an HBC capable machine. The system design constraints and signal transfer characteristics for the implemented HBC-based wearable health monitoring system are measured and analyzed, showing reliable connectivity with >8x power savings compared to Bluetooth lowenergy (BTLE).

"In this work, we demonstrate reconfigurable frequency manipulation of quantum states of light in the telecom C-band. Triggered single photons are encoded in a superposition state of three channels using sidebands up to 53 GHz created by an off-the-shelf phase modulator. The single photons are emitted by an InAs/GaAs quantum dot grown by metal-organic vapor-phase epitaxy within the transparency window of the backbone fiber optical network. A cross-correlation measurement of the sidebands demonstrates the preservation of the single photon nature; an important prerequisite for future quantum technology applications using the existing telecommunication fiber network. "
"We present a combination of local density approximation (LDA) with the dynamical cluster approximation (LDA+DCA) in the framework of the full-potential linear augmented plane-wave method, and compare our LDA+DCA results for SrVO$_3$ to LDA with the dynamical mean field theory (LDA+DMFT) calculations as well as experimental observations on SrVO$_3$. We find a qualitative agreement of the momentum resolved spectral function with angle-resolved photoemission spectra (ARPES) and former LDA+DMFT results. As a correction to LDA+DMFT, we observe more pronounced coherent peaks below the Fermi level, as indicated by ARPES experiments. In addition, we resolve the spectral functions in the ${\bf K}_{0}=(0,0,0)$ and ${\bf K}_{1}=(\pi,\pi,\pi)$ sectors of DCA, where band insulating and metallic phases coexist. Our approach can be applied to correlated compounds where not only local quantum fluctuations but also spatial fluctuations are important. "
"In laser-driven wakefield, ionization induced injection is an efficient way to inject electrons in the plasma wave. A detailed study on the beam dynamics under the influence of beam loading effects, which can be controlled by the concentration of nitrogen impurity introduced in the hydrogen gas was conducted. For a specific value of this percentage, the final energy of the high-energy electron bunch becomes nearly independent of the trapped positions, thus leading to a small energy dispersion. We also show that the final beam emittance is mainly determined by the injection process. "
"The dynamical structure factor (S(Q,E)) of vitreous silica has been measured by Inelastic X-ray Scattering varying the exchanged wavevector (Q) at fixed exchanged energy (E) - an experimental procedure that, contrary to the usual one at constant Q, provides spectra with much better identified inelastic features. This allows the first direct evidence of Brillouin peaks in the S(Q,E) of SiO_2 at energies above the Boson Peak (BP) energy, a finding that excludes the possibility that the BP marks the transition from propagating to localised dynamics in glasses. "
"We study invariant Einstein metrics on the Stiefel manifold $V_k\mathbb{R}^n\cong \mathrm{SO}(n)/\mathrm{SO}(n-k)$ of all orthonormal $k$-frames in $\mathbb{R}^n$. The isotropy representation of this homogeneous space contains equivalent summands, so a complete description of $G$-invariant metrics is not easy. In this paper we view the manifold $V_{2p}\mathbb{R}^n$ as total space over a classical generalized flag manifolds with two isotropy summands and prove for $2\le p\le \frac25 n-1$ it admits at least four invariant Einstein metrics determined by $\mathrm{Ad}(\mathrm{U}(p) \times \mathrm{SO}(n-2p))$-invariant scalar products. Two of the metrics are Jensen's metrics and the other two are new Einstein metrics. "
This version is similar to math.CO/0210113. We've changed Conjectures 1.1 and 1.2 so that they cover arbitrary graphs(digraphs). Let G be an arbitrary graph(digraph). Then - in polynomial time - either an algorithm obtains a hamilton circuit(cycle)or else the algorithm points to at least one vertex that cannot belong to any hamilton circuit(cycle) of G. We give criteria for determining which vertices should be examined.
"There have been significant innovations in media technologies in the recent years. While these developments have improved experiences for individual users, design of multi-user interfaces still remains a challenge. A relatively unexplored area in this context, is enabling multiple users to enjoy shared viewing (e.g. deciding on movies to watch together). In particular, the challenge is to design an intelligent system which would enable viewers to explore together shows or movies they like, seamlessly. This is a complex design problem, as it requires the system to (i) assess affinities of individual users (movies or genres), (ii) combine individual preferences taking into account user-user interactions, and (iii) be non-intrusive simultaneously. The proposed system VoCoG, is an end-to-end intelligent system for collaborative viewing. VoCoG incorporates an online recommendation algorithm, efficient methods for analyzing natural conversation and a graph-based method to fuse preferences of multiple users. It takes user conversation as input, making it non-intrusive. A usability survey of the system indicates that the system provides a good experience to the users as well as relevant recommendations. Further analysis of the usage data reveals insights about the nature of conversation during the interaction sessions, final consensus among the users as well as ratings of varied user groups. "
"In many extentions of standard model, dimension-5 scalar di-photon ($g_{\gamma\gamma\phi}\phi$ $F^{\mu\nu}F_{\mu\nu}$ ) or pseudoscalar di-photon ($g_{\gamma\gamma a}a\tilde{F}^{\mu\nu} F_{\mu\nu} $, ) interaction materializes due to scale symmetry breaking or $U_A(1)$ symmetry breaking. In a magnetized vacuum (i.e., in an external background field $\bar{F}_{\mu\nu} $) the transverse degrees of freedom of the photons-- for such systems-- can be described in terms of the form factors constructed out of the background field strength tensor ($\bar{F}_{\mu\nu} $) and the same for dynamical photon ($f^{\mu\nu}$); they happen to be $\bar{F}_{\mu\nu}f^{\mu\nu}$ and ${\tilde{\bar{F}}_{\mu\nu}f^{\mu\nu}}$. These form factors transform differently under CP transformation. While $\bar{F}_{\mu\nu}f^{\mu\nu}$ (describing polarization orthogonal to B ($|\gamma_{||} >$)) is CP even, the other one, ${\tilde{\bar{F}}_{\mu\nu}f^{\mu\nu}}$( describing polarization along B ($|\gamma_\bot >$), is CP odd. In the interaction Lagrangian, if the scalar is interchanged with the pseudoscalar, the role of the two form factors just gets interchanged. Thus for nearly degenerate strengths of the coupling constants ( $g_{\gamma\gamma\phi}$ and $g_{\gamma\gamma _a}$ ) and masses ($m_\phi$ and $m_a$ ) of the respective candidates, proper identification of one from the other may become very difficult in laboratory or astrophysics based experiments. The basic motivation of this investigation is to reduce this uncertainty through incorporation of parity violating ({\it originating through magnetized medium effects }) part of the photon self-energy in the effective Lagrangian. This step, in turn affects the (Pseudo) Scalar Photon mixing dynamics drastically and brings out a significant change in the spectrum of the electromagnetic beam undergoing such interaction. "
"In this article, we illustrate the flexibility of the algebraic integration formalism introduced by M. Gubinelli (2004), by establishing an existence and uniqueness result for delay equations driven by rough paths. We then apply our results to the case where the driving path is a fractional Brownian motion with Hurst parameter H>1/3. "
"We show that the noncommutativity of space-time destroys the renormalizability of the 1/N expansion of the O(N) Gross-Neveu model. A similar statement holds for the noncommutative nonlinear sigma model. However, we show that, up to the subleading order in 1/N expansion, the noncommutative supersymmetric O(N) nonlinear sigma model becomes renormalizable in D=3. We also show that dynamical mass generation is restored and there is no catastrophic UV/IR mixing. Unlike the commutative case, we find that the Lagrange multiplier fields, which enforce the supersymmetric constraints, are also renormalized. For D=2 the divergence of the four point function of the basic scalar field, which in D=3 is absent, cannot be eliminated by means of a counterterm having the structure of a Moyal product. "
"Inspired by the recent observation of the $\Xi_{cc}^{++}$ by LHCb collaboration, we explore the ""decay constants"" of doubly heavy baryons in the framework of QCD sum rules. With the $\Xi_{cc}, \Xi_{bc}, \Xi_{bb}$, and $\Omega_{cc}, \Omega_{bc}, \Omega_{bb}$ baryons interpolated by three-quark operators, we calculate the correlation functions using the operator product expansion and include the contribution from operators up to dimension six. On the hadron side, we consider both contributions from the lowest-lying states with $J^P=1/2^+$ and from negative parity baryons with $J^P=1/2^-$. We find that the results are stable and the contaminations from negative parity baryons are not severe. These results are ingredients for the QCD study of weak decays and other properties of doubly-heavy baryons. "
We investigate the electrical conductivity(EC) of dense quark matter in the vicinity of the phase transition line. We show that: (i) At high density the Drude EC does not depend on the magnetic field up to $eB \sim 10^{19} \ G$. (ii) In the precritical region the fluctuation EC (paraconductivity) dominates over the Drude one.
"We consider the information-theoretic optimality of treating inter-cell interference as noise in downlink cellular networks modeled as Gaussian interfering broadcast channels. Establishing a new uplink-downlink duality, we cast the problem in Gaussian interfering broadcast channels to that in Gaussian interfering multiple access channels, and characterize an achievable GDoF region under power control and treating inter-cell interference as (Gaussian) noise. We then identify conditions under which this achievable GDoF region is optimal. "
"In recent years, several Scientometrics and Bibliometrics indicators were proposed to evaluate the scientific impact of individuals, institutions, colleges, universities and research teams. The h-index gives a major breakthrough in the research community to evaluate the scientific impact of an individual. It got a lot of attention due to its simplicity and several other indicators were proposed to extend the properties of h-index as well as to overcome shortcomings of h-index. In this literature review, we have discussed the advantages and limitations of almost all Scientometrics as well as Bibliometrics indicators which have been categorized into seven categories :(i) Complement of h-index, (ii) Based on total number of authors, (iii) Based on publication age, (iv) Combination of two indices, (v) Based on excess citation count, (vi) Based on total publication count, (vii) Based on other variants. The main objective of this article is to study all those indicators which have been proposed to evaluate the scientific impact of an individual researcher or a group of researchers. "
"Mechanical metamaterials are artificial composites with tunable advanced mechanical properties. Particularly interesting types of mechanical metamaterials are flexible metamaterials, which harness internal rotations and instabilities to exhibit programmable deformations. However, to date such materials have mostly been considered using nearly purely elastic constituents such as neo-Hookean rubbers. Here we explore experimentally the mechanical snap-through response of metamaterials that are made of constituents that exhibit large viscoelastic relaxation effects, encountered in the vast majority of rubbers, in particular in 3D printed rubbers. We show that they exhibit a very strong sensitivity to the loading rate. In particular, the mechanical instability is strongly affected beyond a certain loading rate. We rationalize our findings with a compliant mechanism model augmented with viscoelastic interactions, which captures qualitatively well the reported behavior, suggesting that the sensitivity to loading rate stems from the nonlinear and inhomogeneous deformation rate, provoked by internal rotations. Our findings bring a novel understanding of metamaterials in the dynamical regime and opens up avenues for the use of metamaterials for dynamical shape-changing as well as vibration and impact damping applications. "
"We compute critical exponents of O(N) models in fractal dimensions between two and four, and for continuos values of the number of field components N, in this way completing the RG classification of universality classes for these models. In d=2 the N-dependence of the correlation length critical exponent gives us the last piece of information needed to establish a RG derivation of the Mermin-Wagner theorem. We also report critical exponents for multi-critical universality classes in the cases N>1 and N=0. Finally, in the large-N limit our critical exponents correctly approach those of the spherical model, allowing us to set N~100 as threshold for the quantitative validity of leading order large-N estimates. "
"We analyze one-particle inclusive DIS in the case when a spin-1 hadron (such as a vector meson) is observed in the final state. We consider only leading order contributions in 1/Q, but we include transverse momentum of partons. Several new fragmentation functions appear in cross sections. One of them can be measured in connection with the transverse-spin disbtribution function h_1. "
"We use cosmological N-body/gasdynamical simulations that include star formation and feedback to examine the proposal that scaling laws between the total luminosity, rotation speed, and angular momentum of disk galaxies reflect analogous correlations between the structural parameters of their surrounding dark matter halos. The numerical experiments follow the formation of galaxy-sized halos in two Cold Dark Matter dominated universes: the standard Omega=1 CDM scenario and the currently popular LCDM model. We find that the slope and scatter of the I-band Tully-Fisher relation are well reproduced in the simulations, although not, as proposed in recent work, as a result of the cosmological equivalence between halo mass and circular velocity: large systematic variations in the fraction of baryons that collapse to form galaxies and in the ratio between halo and disk circular velocities are observed in our numerical experiments. The Tully-Fisher slope and scatter are recovered in this model as a direct result of the dynamical response of the halo to the assembly of the luminous component of the galaxy. We conclude that models that neglect the self-gravity of the disk and its influence on the detailed structure of the halo cannot be used to derive meaningful estimates of the scatter or slope of the Tully-Fisher relation. Our models fail, however, to match the zero-point of the Tully-Fisher relation, as well as that of the relation linking disk rotation speed and angular momentum. These failures can be traced, respectively, to the excessive central concentration of dark halos formed in the Cold Dark Matter cosmogonies we explore and to the formation of galaxy disks as the final outcome of a sequence of merger events.

The influence of a superconducting fault current limiter (FCL) on the transient stability of the synchronic operation of electric machines is analyzed for different locations of the inductive FCL in a network and for different parameters of the device. It is shown that the stability can be improved or degraded depending on the FCL impedance under a fault and the time of the recovery of the initial state of the limiter after a fault. Improving the transient stability with the inductive superconducting FCL is demonstrated in the experiments on the electrodynamic model of a power system. The expansion of the obtained results for other FCL designs is discussed.
"Neuromorphic hardware platforms implement biological neurons and synapses to execute spiking neural networks (SNNs) in an energy-efficient manner. We present SpiNeMap, a design methodology to map SNNs to crossbar-based neuromorphic hardware, minimizing spike latency and energy consumption. SpiNeMap operates in two steps: SpiNeCluster and SpiNePlacer. SpiNeCluster is a heuristic-based clustering technique to partition SNNs into clusters of synapses, where intracluster local synapses are mapped within crossbars of the hardware and inter-cluster global synapses are mapped to the shared interconnect. SpiNeCluster minimizes the number of spikes on global synapses, which reduces spike congestion on the shared interconnect, improving application performance. SpiNePlacer then finds the best placement of local and global synapses on the hardware using a meta-heuristic-based approach to minimize energy consumption and spike latency. We evaluate SpiNeMap using synthetic and realistic SNNs on the DynapSE neuromorphic hardware. We show that SpiNeMap reduces average energy consumption by 45% and average spike latency by 21%, compared to state-of-the-art techniques. "
"Extra neutral gauge bosons suggested by models beyond the standard model can indirectly show up in $e^{+} e^{-}$ collisions through off-resonance deviations of various physical observables from the corresponding standard model values. We considered leptonic observables and studied the dependence of the deviations on the polarizations of the positron and electron beams. We showed that, for a given model, the magnitude of the deviation of a given observable can attain its maximum value if the polarizations of the positron and electron beams are properly chosen. We determined, for a given model, a single set of beam polarization so that if this set is employed in measuring all considered observables, it produces the highest extra gauge boson discovery limits.

"Recently, the higher-order Carlitz's q-Bernoulli polynomials are represented as q-Volkenborn integral on Zp by Kim. A question was asked in [13] as to finding the extended formulaeof symmetries for Bernoulli polynomials which are related to Carlitz q-Bernoulli polynomials. In this paper, we give some new identities of symmetry for the higher-order Carlitz q-Bernoulli polynomials whch are derived from multivariate q-Volkenborn integrals on Zp. We note that they are a partial answer to that question. . "

"We obtain a compactness result for various classes of Riemannian metrics in dimension four; in particular our method applies to anti-self-dual metrics, Kahler metrics with constant scalar curvature, and metrics with harmonic curvature. With certain geometric assumptions, the moduli space can be compactified by adding metrics with orbifold singularities. Similar results were obtained previously for Einstein metrics, but our analysis differs substantially from the Einstein case in that we do not assume any pointwise Ricci curvature bound. "
"Functional time series whose sample elements are recorded sequentially over time are frequently encountered with increasing technology. Recent studies have shown that analyzing and forecasting of functional time series can be performed easily using functional principal component analysis and existing univariate/multivariate time series models. However, the forecasting performance of such functional time series models may be affected by the presence of outlying observations which are very common in many scientific fields. Outliers may distort the functional time series model structure, and thus, the underlying model may produce high forecast errors. We introduce a robust forecasting technique based on weighted likelihood methodology to obtain point and interval forecasts in functional time series in the presence of outliers. The finite sample performance of the proposed method is illustrated by Monte Carlo simulations and four real-data examples. Numerical results reveal that the proposed method exhibits superior performance compared with the existing method(s). "
"We have implemented an experimental set-up in order to demonstrate the feasibility of time-coding protocols for quantum key distribution. Alice produces coherent 20 ns faint pulses of light at 853 nm. They are sent to Bob with delay 0 ns (encoding bit 0) or 10 ns (encoding bit 1). Bob directs at random the received pulses to two different arms. In the first one, a 300 ps resolution Si photon-counter allows Bob to precisely measure the detection times of each photon in order to establish the key. Comparing them with the emission times of the pulses sent by Alice allows to evaluate the quantum bit error rate (QBER). The minimum obtained QBER is 1.62 %. The possible loss of coherence in the set-up can be exploited by Eve to eavesdrop the line. Therefore, the second arm of Bob set-up is a Mach-Zender interferometer with a 10 ns propagation delay between the two path. Contrast measurement of the output beams allows to measure the autocorrelation function of the received pulses that characterizes their average coherence. In the case of an ideal set-up, the value expected with the pulses sent by Alice is 0.576. The experimental value of the pulses autocorrelation function is found to be 0.541. Knowing the resulting loss of coherence and the measured QBER, one can evaluate the mutual information between Alice and Eve and the mutual information between Alice and Bob, in the case of intercept-resend attacks and in the case of attacks with intrication. With our values, Bob has an advantage on Eve of 0.43 bit per pulse. The maximum possible QBER corresponding to equal informations for Bob and Eve is 5.8 %. With the usual attenuation of fibres at 850 nm, it shows that secure key distribution is possible up to a distance of 2.75 km, which is sufficient for local links. "
"We show that the $\sigma/f_0(500)$ state with finite-temperature $T$ corrections to its spectral properties included, plays an essential role for the description of the scalar susceptibility $\chi_S$, signaling chiral symmetry restoration. First, we use the $O(4)$ Linear Sigma Model as a testbed to derive the connection between $\chi_S$ and the $\sigma$ propagator and to check the validity and reliability of the approach where $\chi_S$ is saturated by the $\sigma/f_0(500)$ inverse self-energy, which we calculate at finite $T$ to one loop. A more accurate phenomenological description is achieved by considering the saturation approach as given by the thermal $f_0(500)$ state generated in Unitarized Chiral Perturbation Theory. Such approach allows to describe fairly well recent lattice data within the uncertainty range given by the UChPT parameters. Finally, we compare the UChPT saturated description with one based on the Hadron Resonance Gas, for which the hadron mass dependences are extracted from recent theoretical analysis. Several fits to lattice data are performed, which confirm the validity of the thermal $f_0(500)$ saturated approach and hence the importance of that thermal state for chiral symmetry restoration. "
"Many biological and chemical systems exhibit collective behavior in response to the change in their population density. These elements or cells communicate with each other via dynamical agents or signaling molecules. In this work, we explore the dynamics of nonlinear oscillators, specifically Stuart-Landau oscillators and Rayleigh oscillators, interacting globally through dynamical agents in the surrounding environment modeled as a quorum sensing interaction. The system exhibits the typical continuous second-order transition from oscillatory state to death state, when the oscillation amplitude is small. However, interestingly, when the amplitude of oscillations is large we find that the system shows an abrupt transition from oscillatory to death state, a transition termed ""explosive death"". So the quorum-sensing form of interaction can induce the usual second-order transition, as well as sudden first-order transitions. Further in case of the explosive death transitions, the oscillatory state and the death state coexist over a range of coupling strengths near the transition point. This emergent regime of hysteresis widens with increasing strength of the mean-field feedback, and is relevant to hysteresis that is widely observed in biological, chemical and physical processes. "
"We present an experimental demonstration as well as a theoretical model of an integrated circuit designed for the manipulation of a microwave field down to the single-photon level. The device is made of a superconducting resonator coupled to a transmission line via a second frequency-tunable resonator. The tunable resonator can be used as a tunable coupler between the fixed resonator and the transmission line. Moreover, the manipulation of the microwave field between the two resonators is possible. In particular, we demonstrate the swapping of the field from one resonator to the other by pulsing the frequency detuning between the two resonators. The behavior of the system, which determines how the device can be operated, is analyzed as a function of one key parameter of the system, the damping ratio of the coupled resonators. We show a good agreement between experiments and simulations, realized by solving a set of coupled differential equations. "
"The increase in data collection has made data annotation an interesting and valuable task in the contemporary world. This paper presents a new methodology for quickly annotating data using click-supervision and hierarchical object detection. The proposed work is semi-automatic in nature where the task of annotations is split between the human and a neural network. We show that our improved method of annotation reduces the time, cost and mental stress on a human annotator. The research also highlights how our method performs better than the current approach in different circumstances such as variation in number of objects, object size and different datasets. Our approach also proposes a new method of using object detectors making it suitable for data annotation task. The experiment conducted on PASCAL VOC dataset revealed that annotation created from our approach achieves a mAP of 0.995 and a recall of 0.903. The Our Approach has shown an overall improvement by 8.5%, 18.6% in mean average precision and recall score for KITTI and 69.6%, 36% for CITYSCAPES dataset. The proposed framework is 3-4 times faster as compared to the standard annotation method. "
"We give a simple and direct treatment of the strong convergence of quantum random walks to quantum stochastic operator cocycles, via the semigroup decomposition of such cocycles. Our approach also delivers convergence of the pointwise product of quantum random walks to the quantum stochastic Trotter product of the respective limit cocycles, thereby revealing the algebraic structure of the limiting procedure. The repeated quantum interactions model is shown to fit nicely into the convergence scheme described. "
"Multivariate spatial field data are increasingly common and whose modeling typically relies on building cross-covariance functions to describe cross-process relationships. An alternative viewpoint is to model the matrix of spectral measures. We develop the notions of coherence, phase and gain for multidimensional stationary processes. Coherence, as a function of frequency, can be seen to be a measure of linear relationship between two spatial processes at that frequency band. We use the coherence function to illustrate fundamental limitations on a number of previously proposed constructions for multivariate processes, suggesting these options are not viable for real data. We also give natural interpretations to cross-covariance parameters of the Matern class, where the smoothness indexes dependence at low frequencies while the range parameter can imply dependence at low or high frequencies. Estimation follows from smoothed multivariate periodogram matrices. We illustrate the estimation and interpretation of these functions on two datasets, forecast and reanalysis sea level pressure and geopotential heights over the equatorial region. Examining these functions lends insight that would otherwise be difficult to detect and model using standard cross-covariance formulations. "
"We study a theoretical model of closed quasi-hermitian chain of spins which exhibits quantum analogues of chimera states, i.e. long life classical states for which a part of an oscillator chain presents an ordered dynamics whereas another part presents a disordered chaotic dynamics. For the quantum analogue, the chimera behavior deals with the entanglement between the spins of the chain. We discuss the entanglement properties, quantum chaos, quantum disorder and semi-classical similarity of our quantum chimera system. The quantum chimera concept is novel and induces new perspectives concerning the entanglement of multipartite systems. "
"Discrete derived categories were studied initially by Vossieck \cite{Vossieck} and later by Bobi\'nski, Gei\ss, Skowro\'nski \cite{BGS}. In this article, we define the CW complex of silting pairs for a triangulated category and show that it is contractible in the case of discrete derived categories. We provide an explicit embedding from the silting CW complex into the stability manifold. By work of Qiu and Woolf, there is a deformation retract of the stability manifold onto the silting pairs CW complex. We obtain that the space of stability conditions of discrete derived categories is contractible. "
"In this work, we present new soliton solutions for thick branes in $4+1$ dimensions. In particular, we consider brane models based on the sine-Gordon ($SG$), $\varphi^{4}$ and $\varphi^{6}$ scalar fields, which have broken $Z_{2}$ symmetry in some cases, and are responsible for supporting and stabilizing the thick branes. The origin of the symmetry breaking in these models resides in the fact that the modified scalar field potential may have non-degenerate vacuua. These vacuua determine the cosmological constant on both sides of the brane. We also study the geodesic equations along the fifth dimension, in order to explore the particle motion in the neighbourhood of the brane. Furthermore, we examine the stability of the thick branes, by determining the sign of the $w^2$ term in the expansion of the potential for the resulting Schrodinger-like equation, where $w$ is the 5-dimensional coordinate. It turns out that the $\varphi^4$ brane is stable, while there are unstable modes for certain ranges of the model parameters in the SG and $\varphi^6$ branes. "
"We present in this paper an exact study concerning a first order transition induced by an inhomogeneous boundary magnetic field in the 2D Ising model. From a previous analysis of the interfacial free energy in the discrete case (J. Phys. A, 2849, 2005), we identify, using an asymptotic expansion in the thermodynamic limit, the transition line that separates the regime where the interface is localised near the boundary from the regime where it is propagating inside the bulk. In particular, the critical line has a strong dependence on the aspect ratio of the lattice. "
"The geometry of a light wavefront, evolving from a initial flat wavefront in the 3-space associated with a post-Newtonian relativistic spacetime, is studied numerically by means of the ray tracing method. For a discretization of the bidimensional light wavefront, a surface fitting technique is used to determine the curvature of this surface. The relationship between the intrinsic curvature of the wavefront and the change of the arrival time at different points on the Earth is also numerically discussed. "
"We investigate the possibility to suppress noise-induced intensity pulsations (relaxation oscillations) in semiconductor lasers by means of a time-delayed feedback control scheme. This idea is first studied in a generic normal form model, where we derive an analytic expression for the mean amplitude of the oscillations and demonstrate that it can be strongly modulated by varying the delay time. We then investigate the control scheme analytically and numerically in a laser model of Lang-Kobayashi type and show that relaxation oscillations excited by noise can be very efficiently suppressed via feedback from a Fabry-Perot resonator. "
"As part of our program to map the large-scale distribution of galaxies behind the Milky Way, we used the Parkes 210 ft (64 m) radio telescope for pointed HI observations of a sample of low surface-brightness (due to heavy obscuration) spiral galaxies selected from the deep optical Zone of Avoidance (ZOA) galaxy catalog in the Hydra/Antlia region (Kraan-Korteweg 2000a). Searching a simultaneous velocity range of either 300 to 5500 km/s or 300 to 10500 km/s to an rms level of typically 2 - 4 mJy resulted in detections in 61 of the 139 pointings, leading to a total of 66 detections (an additional detection was made in a reference position, and two other pointings revealed two and four independent signals respectively). Except for 2 strong HI emitters identified in the shallow Zone of Avoidance HI survey (Henning et al. 2000), all HI detections are new. An analysis of the properties of the observed and detected galaxies prove that pointed HI observations of highly obscured galaxies allow the tracing of a population of nearby, intrinsically large and bright spiral galaxies that otherwise would not be recovered. The new data identified a previously unrecognized nearby group at l=287.5, b=-9.5, V=1700 km/s, the continuation of the Hydra/Antlia filament on the opposite side of the Galactic plane, and helped to delimit a distinct void in the ZOA centered at 2000 km/s.

"Diacritization of Arabic text is both an interesting and a challenging problem at the same time with various applications ranging from speech synthesis to helping students learning the Arabic language. Like many other tasks or problems in Arabic language processing, the weak efforts invested into this problem and the lack of available (open-source) resources hinder the progress towards solving this problem. This work provides a critical review for the currently existing systems, measures and resources for Arabic text diacritization. Moreover, it introduces a much-needed free-for-all cleaned dataset that can be easily used to benchmark any work on Arabic diacritization. Extracted from the Tashkeela Corpus, the dataset consists of 55K lines containing about 2.3M words. After constructing the dataset, existing tools and systems are tested on it. The results of the experiments show that the neural Shakkala system significantly outperforms traditional rule-based approaches and other closed-source tools with a Diacritic Error Rate (DER) of 2.88% compared with 13.78%, which the best DER for the non-neural approach (obtained by the Mishkal tool). "
"Motivated by the emittance requirements for future light sources, we show how longitudinal-transverse correlations can be introduced to create beams with large emittance asymmetry. This concept generalizes a key aspect of a Flat Beam Transform, which introduces initial correlations among the transverse planes, to systems with initial longitudinal-transverse correlations. We present an eigen-emittance formalism to analyze such systems. We illustrate the approach by analyzing an electron beam emitted from a photoinjector utilizing a laser with a tilted pulse front. This approach can be used to design beam delivery systems that achieve extraordinarily transversely bright electron beams. "
"Let F be a non-Archimedean local field of residual characteristic p, and $\ell$ be a prime number different from p. We consider the local Jacquet-Langlands correspondence between $\ell$-adic discrete series of GL(n,F) and an inner form GL(m,D). We show that it respects the relationship of congruence modulo $\ell$. More precisely, we show that two integral $\ell$-adic discrete series of GL(m,D) are congruent modulo $\ell$ if and only if the same holds for their Jacquet-Langlands transfers to GL(m,D). "
We study localization in two- and three channel quasi-1D systems using multichain tight-binding Anderson models with nearest-neighbour interchain hopping. In the three chain case we discuss both the case of free- and that of periodic boundary conditions between the chains. The finite disordered wires are connected to ideal leads and the localization length is defined from the Landauer conductance in terms of the transmission coefficients matrix. The transmission- and reflection amplitudes in properly defined quantum channels are obtained from S-matrices constructed from transfer matrices in Bloch wave bases for the various quasi-1D systems. Our exact analytic expressions for localization lengths for weak disorder reduce to the Thouless expression for 1D systems in the limit of vanishing interchain hopping. For weak interchain hopping the localization length decreases with respect to the 1D value in all three cases. In the three-channel cases it increases with interchain hopping over restricted domains of large hopping.
"The study of entire holomorphic curves contained in projective algebraic varieties is intimately related to fascinating questions of geometry and number theory -- especially through the concepts of curvature and positivity which are central themes in Kodaira's contributions to mathematics. The aim of these lectures is to present recent results concerning the geometric side of the problem. The Green-Griffiths-Lang conjecture stipulates that for every projective variety $X$ of general type over $\mathbb{C}$, there exists a proper algebraic subvariety $Y$ of $X$ containing all non constant entire curves $f:\mathbb{C}\to X$. Using the formalism of directed varieties and jet bundles, we show that this assertion holds true in case $X$ satisfies a strong general type condition that is related to a certain jet-semistability property of the tangent bundle $T_X$. It is possible to exploit similar techniques to investigate a famous conjecture of Shoshichi Kobayashi (1970), according to which a generic algebraic hypersurface of dimension $n$ and of sufficiently large degree $d\ge d_n$ in the complex projective space $\mathbb{P}^{n+1}$ is hyperbolic: in the early 2000's, Yum-Tong Siu proposed a strategy that led in 2015 to a proof based on a clever use of slanted vector fields on jet spaces, combined with Nevanlinna theory arguments. In 2016, the conjecture has been settled in a different way by Damian Brotbek, making a more direct use of Wronskian differential operators and associated multiplier ideals; shortly afterwards, Ya Deng showed how the proof could be modified to yield an explicit value of $d_n$. We give here a short proof based on a drastic simplification of their ideas, along with a further improvement of Deng's bound, namely $d_n=\lfloor\frac{1}{5}(en)^{2n+2}\rfloor$. "
"A short introduction on quantum thermodynamics is given and three new topics are discussed: 1) Maximal work extraction from a finite quantum system. The thermodynamic prediction fails and a new, general result is derived, the ``ergotropy''. 2) In work extraction from two-temperature setups, the presence of correlations can push the effective efficiency beyond the Carnot bound. 3) In the presence of level crossing, non-slow changes may be more optimal than slow ones. "
"We present T-ReCS high spatial resolution N-band (8-13 micron) spectroscopy of the central regions (a few kpc) of 3 local LIRGs. The nuclear spectra show deep 9.7 micron silicate absorption feature and the high ionization [SIV]10.5 micron emission line, consistent with their optical classification as AGN. The two LIRGs with unresolved mid-IR emission do not show PAH emission at 11.3 micron in their nuclear spectra. The spatially resolved mid-IR spectroscopy of NGC 5135 allows us to separate out the spectra of the Seyfert nucleus, an HII region, and the diffuse region between them on scales of less than 2.5 arcsec ~ 600 pc. The diffuse region spectrum is characterized by strong PAH emission with almost no continuum, whereas the HII region shows PAH emission with a smaller equivalent width as well as [NeII]12.8 micron line. "
"A phase modulated RF current source is applied to an injection locked diode laser operating at $780\unit{nm}$. This produces tunable phase modulated sidebands of the laser suitable for stabilizing the length of an optical transfer cavity using the Pound-Drever-Hall technique. The Pound-Drever-Hall signal is anti-symmetric about the lock point, despite the presence of significant diode laser amplitude modulation. The stabilized optical transfer cavity is used to frequency stabilize a 776 nm external cavity diode laser. The stability and tunability of this transfer cavity locked laser is established by observation of the hyperfine components of the $^{87}$Rb $5P_{3/2}-5D_{5/2}$ transition in a vapor cell. "
"Based on first-principles calculations, the evolution of the electronic and magnetic properties of transition metal dihalides MX$_2$ (M= V, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni; X = Cl, Br, I) is analyzed from the bulk to the monolayer limit. A variety of magnetic ground states is obtained as a result of the competition between direct exchange and superexchange. The results predict that FeX$_2$, NiX$_2$, CoCl$_2$ and CoBr$_2$ monolayers are ferromagnetic insulators with sizable magnetocrystalline anisotropies. This makes them ideal candidates for robust ferromagnetism at the single layer level. Our results also highlight the importance of spin-orbit coupling to obtain the correct ground state. "
"The construction of finite tight Gabor frames plays an important role in many applications. These applications include significant ones in signal and image processing. We explore when constant amplitude zero autocorrelation (CAZAC) sequences can be used to generate tight Gabor frames. The main theorem uses Janssen's representation and the zeros of the discrete periodic ambiguity function to give necessary and sufficient conditions for determining whether any Gabor frame is tight. The relevance of the theorem depends significantly on the construction of examples. These examples are necessarily intricate, and to a large extent, depend on CAZAC sequences. Finally, we present an alternative method for determining whether a Gabor system yields a tight frame. This alternative method does not prove tightness using the main theorem, but instead uses the Gram matrix of the Gabor system. "
We present Doppler and modulation tomography of the low-mass X-ray binary V691 CrA with data obtained using the 6.5-m Magellan Baade telescope at the Las Campanas Observatory in 2010 and 2011. The disc and hotspot are observed in H\alpha and He II (\lambda 4686) in both years. A clear image of the disc is seen in He II (\lambda 5411) using the 2010 data. We present the first tomography of the absorption line He I (\lambda 5876) and detect absorption near the L_1 point of the donor star. We also present the first modulation tomography of the emission line H\alpha and detect emission from the secondary. The H\alpha double peaks are imbedded in a deep absorption trough confirming the presence of Balmer line absorbing material in the system. Our observations of H\alpha show absorption in a larger phase range than in H\beta which could be due to heating up of sprayed matter from the hotspot as it travels downstream. We also suggest possible occultation of the H\alpha absorbing spray by the disc bulge at certain phases.
"We use a density matrix renormalization group method to study quantitatively the phase diagram of a one-dimensional extended Hubbard model at half-filling by investigating the correlation functions and structure factors. We confirm the existence of a novel narrow region with long-rang bond-order-wave order which is highly controversial recently between the charge-density-wave phase and Mott insulator phase. We determined accurately the position of the tricritical point $U_t\simeq 7.2t$, $V_t\simeq 3.746t$ which is quite different from previous studies. "
"High-energy {\gamma}-rays, which are produced by powerful relativistic jets, are usually associated with blazars and radio galaxies. In the current active galactic nuclei (AGN) paradigm, such jets are almost exclusively launched from massive elliptical galaxies. Recently, however, Fermi/LAT detected {\gamma}-rays from a few narrow-line Seyfert 1 galaxies and thus confirmed the presence of relativistic jets in them. Since NLS1 galaxies are assumed to be young evolving AGN, they offer a unique opportunity to study the production of relativistic jets in late-type galaxies. Our aim is to estimate by which processes the emission of various kinds is produced in NLS1 galaxies and to study how emission properties are connected to other intrinsic AGN properties. We have compiled the so far largest multiwavelength database of NLS1 sources. This allowed us to explore correlations between different wavebands and source properties using, for example, Pearson and Spearman correlations and principal component analysis. We did this separately for radio-loud and radio-quiet sources. Multiwavelength correlations suggest that radio-loud sources host relativistic jets that are the predominant sources of radio, optical, and X-ray emission. The origin of infrared emission remains unclear. Radio-quiet sources do not host a jet, or the jet is very weak. In them, radio and infrared emission is more likely generated via star formation processes, and the optical and X-ray emission originate in the inner parts of the AGN. We also find that the black hole mass correlates significantly with radio loudness, which suggests that NLS1 galaxies with more massive black holes are more likely to be able to launch powerful relativistic jets. "
"We study the low temperature static and dynamical properties of the classical bond-disordered antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on the kagome lattice. This model has recently been shown to host a new type of spin liquid exhibiting an exponentially large number of discrete ground states. Surprisingly, despite the rigidity of the groundstates, we establish the vanishing of the corresponding spin stiffness. Locally, the low-lying eigenvectors of the Hessian appear to exhibit a fractal inverse participation ratio. Its spin dynamics resembles that of Coulomb Heisenberg spin liquids, but exhibits a new low-temperature dynamically arrested regime, which however gets squeezed out with increasing system size. We also probe the properties of the energy landscape underpinning this behaviour, and find energy barriers between distinct ground states vanishing with system size. In turn the local minima appear highly connected and the system tends to lose memory of its inital state in an accumulation of soft directions. "
A short proof is given for the well-known Choi-Effros theorem on the structure of ranges of completely positive projections.
"Characterization of the morphology of strongly lensed galaxies is challenging because images of such galaxies are typically highly distorted. Lens modeling and source plane reconstruction is one approach that can provide reasonably undistorted images from which morphological measurements can be made, although at the expense of a highly spatially variable telescope PSF when mapped back to the source plane. Unfortunately, modeling the lensing mass is a time and resource intensive process, and in many cases there are too few constraints to precisely model the lensing mass. If, however, useful morphological measurements could be made in the image plane rather than the source plane, it would bypass this issue and obviate the need for a source reconstruction process for some applications. We examine the use of the Gini coefficient as one such measurement. Because it depends on the cumulative distribution of the light of a galaxy, but not the relative spatial positions, the fact that surface brightness is conserved by lensing means that the Gini coefficient may be well-preserved by strong gravitational lensing. Through simulations, we test the extent to which the Gini coefficient is conserved, including by effects due to PSF convolution and pixelization, to determine whether it is invariant enough under lensing to be used as a measurement of galaxy morphology that can be made in the image plane. "
We present the natural arguments for the rationality of a recently proposed simple approach for renormalization which is based solving differential equations. The renormalization group equation is also derived in a natural way and recognized as a decoupling theorem of the UV modes that underlie a QFT. This new strategy has direct implications to the scheme dependence problem.
"We investigate the large scale cosmological perturbation in the Universe with multiple perfect fluids. Using the long-wavelength approximation with Hamilton-Jacobi method, we derive the formula for the gauge invariant comoving curvature perturbation. As an application of our approach, we examine the large scale perturbation in a brane cosmology. "
"Motivated by the study of area laws for the entanglement entropy of gapped ground states of quantum spin systems and their stability, we prove that the unitary cocycle generated by a local time-dependent Hamiltonian can be approximated, for any finite set $X$, by a tensor product of the corresponding unitaries in $X$ and its complement, multiplied by a dynamics strictly supported in the neighbourhood of the surface $\partial X$. The error decays almost exponentially in the size of the neighbourhood and grows with the square of the area~$\vert \partial X\vert^2$. "
"Given a set of integers with no three in arithmetic progression, we construct a Stanley sequence by adding integers greedily so that no arithmetic progression is formed. This paper offers two main contributions to the theory of Stanley sequences. First, we characterize well-structured Stanley sequences as solutions to constraints in modular arithmetic, defining the modular Stanley sequences. Second, we introduce the basic Stanley sequences, where elements arise as the sums of subsets of a basis sequence, which in the simplest case is the powers of 3. Applications of our results include the construction of Stanley sequences with arbitrarily large gaps between terms, answering a weak version of a problem by Erd\H{o}s et al. Finally, we generalize many results about Stanley sequences to $p$-free sequences, where $p$ is any odd prime. "
"In the framework of the Magnetism in Massive Stars (MiMeS) project, a HARPSpol Large Program at the 3.6m-ESO telescope has recently started to collect high-resolution spectropolarimetric data of a large number of Southern massive OB stars in the field of the Galaxy and in many young clusters and associations. In this Letter, we report on the first discoveries of magnetic fields in two massive stars with HARPSpol - HD 130807 and HD 122451, and confirm the presence of a magnetic field at the surface of HD 105382 that was previously observed with a low spectral resolution device. The longitudinal magnetic field measurements are strongly varying for HD 130807 from $\sim$-100 G to $\sim$700 G. Those of HD 122451 and HD 105382 are less variable with values ranging from $\sim$-40 to -80 G, and from $\sim$-300 to -600 G, respectively. The discovery and confirmation of three new magnetic massive stars, including at least two He-weak stars, is an important contribution to one of the MiMeS objectives: the understanding of origin of magnetic fields in massive stars and their impacts on stellar structure and evolution. "
"Spectral analysis in conjunction with discrete data in one and more dimensions can become a challenging task, because the methods are sometimes difficult to understand. This paper intends to provide an overview about the usage of the Fourier transform, its related methods and focuses on the subtleties to which the users must pay attention. Typical questions, which are often addressed to the data, will be discussed. Such a problem can be the issue of frequency or band limitation of the signal. Or the source of artifacts might be of interest, when a Fourier transform is carried out. Another topic is the issue with fragmented data. Here, the Lomb-Scargle method will be explained with an illustrative example to deal with this special type of signal. Furthermore, a challenge encountered very often is the time-dependent spectral analysis, with which one can evaluate the point in time when a certain frequency appears in the signal. The information to solve such problems and to answer this questions is spread over many disciplines ranging from mathematics, electrical engineering, economic science to astrophysics. The goal of the first part of this paper is to collect the important information about the common methods to give the reader a guide on how to use these for application on one-dimensional data. The second part of this paper will then address the two- and more-dimensional data. The introduced methods are supported by the spectral package, which has been published for the statistical environment R prior this article. "
Every knot can be unknotted with two generalized twists; this was first proved by Ohyama. Here we prove that any knot of genus g can be unknotted with 2g null-homologous twists and that there exist genus g knots that cannot be unknotted with fewer than 2g null-homologous twists.
"I present a total of 98.8 ksec ($\sim$ 3$\times$30 ksec) observation of T Pyx with the ACIS-S3 detector on-board the $Chandra$ Observatory obtained during the quiescent phase, about 2-3 months before its outburst in April 2011. The total $Chandra$ spectrum of the source T Pyx gives a maximum temperature kT$_{max}$$>$ 37.0 keV with (0.9-1.5)$\times 10^{-13}$ erg s$^{-1}$ cm$^{-2}$ and (1.3-2.2)$\times$10$^{32}$ erg s$^{-1}$ (at 3.5 kpc) in the 0.1-50 keV range using a multi-temperature plasma emission model (i.e., CEVMKL in XSPEC). I find a ratio of (L$_{x}$/L$_{disk}$)$\simeq$(2-7)$\times$10$^{-4}$ indicating considerable inefficiency of emission in the boundary layer. There is no blackbody emission with 2$\sigma$ upper limits kT$_{BB}$$<$ 25 eV and L$_{soft}$$<$ 2.0$\times$10$^{33}$ erg s$^{-1}$ in the 0.1-10.0 keV band. All fits yield only interstellar N${\rm _H}$ during quiescence. I suggest that T Pyx has an optically thin boundary layer (BL) merged with an ADAF-like flow (Advection-Dominated Flow) and/or X-ray corona in the inner disk indicating ongoing quasi-spherical accretion at (very) high rates during quiescent phases. Such a BL structure may be excessively heating the WD, influencing the thermonuclear runaway leading to the recurrent nova events. The central source (i.e., the binary system) emission and its spectrum is deconvolved with a detailed procedure at the sub-pixel level revealing an extended emission with S/N $\sim$6-10. The derived shape looks like an elliptical nebula with a semi-major axis $\sim$1.0 arc sec and a semi-minor axis $\sim$0.5 arc sec. The calculated approximate count rate of the extended emission is 0.0013-0.0025 c s$^{-1}$. The luminosity of the nebula is $\sim$(0.6-30.0)$\times$10$^{31}$ erg s$^{-1}$. The nebulosity seems consistent with an interaction of the outflow/ejecta from the 1966 outburst. "
"Using SU(3) symmetry to constrain the pion BB' couplings, assuming SU(3) breaking comes only from one-loop pion cloud contributions, and using the the covariant spectator theory to describe the photon coupling to the quark core, we show how the experimental masses and magnetic moments of the baryon octet can be used to set a model independent constraint on the strength of the pion cloud contributions to the octet, and hence the nucleon, form factors at Q2=0. "
"We study ballistic transport of spin-polarized electrons through quantum wires in which the strength of the Rashba spin-orbit interaction (SOI) is spatially modulated. Subband mixing, due to SOI, between the two lowest subbands is taken into account. Simplified approximate expressions for the transmission are obtained for electron energies close to the bottom of the first subband and near the value for which anticrossing of the two lowest subbands occurs. In structures with periodically varied SOI strength, {\it square-wave} modulation on the spin transmission is found when only one subband is occupied and its possible application to the spin transistor is discussed. When two subbands are occupied the transmission is strongly affected by the existence of SOI interfaces as well as by the subband mixing. "
"Gamma rays and neutrons, emitted following spontaneous fission of 252Cf, were measured in an AGATA experiment performed at INFN Laboratori Nazionali di Legnaro in Italy. The setup consisted of four AGATA triple cluster detectors (12 36-fold segmented high-purity germanium crystals), placed at a distance of 50 cm from the source, and 16 HELENA BaF2 detectors. The aim of the experiment was to study the interaction of neutrons in the segmented high-purity germanium detectors of AGATA and to investigate the possibility to discriminate neutrons and gamma rays with the gamma-ray tracking technique. The BaF2 detectors were used for a time-of-flight measurement, which gave an independent discrimination of neutrons and gamma rays and which was used to optimise the gamma-ray tracking-based neutron rejection methods. It was found that standard gamma-ray tracking, without any additional neutron rejection features, eliminates effectively most of the interaction points due to recoiling Ge nuclei after elastic scattering of neutrons. Standard tracking rejects also a significant amount of the events due to inelastic scattering of neutrons in the germanium crystals. Further enhancements of the neutron rejection was obtained by setting conditions on the following quantities, which were evaluated for each event by the tracking algorithm: energy of the first and second interaction point, difference in the calculated incoming direction of the gamma ray, figure-of-merit value. The experimental results of tracking with neutron rejection agree rather well with Geant4 simulations. "
We present a model of single species fishery which alternates closed seasons with pulse captures. The novelty is that the length of a closed season is determined by the stock size of the last capture. The process is described by a new type of impulsive differential equations recently introduced. The main result is a fishing effort threshold which determines either the sustainability of the fishery or the extinction of the resource.
"We develop a computational method based on an Eulerian field called the ""reference map"", which relates the current location of a material point to its initial. The reference map can be discretized to permit finite-difference simulation of large solid-like deformations, in any dimension, of the type that might otherwise require the finite element method. The generality of the method stems from its ability to easily compute kinematic quantities essential to solid mechanics, that are elusive outside of Lagrangian frame. This introductory work focuses on large-strain, hyperelastic materials. After a brief review of hyperelasticity, a discretization of the method is presented and some non-trivial elastic deformations are simulated, both static and dynamic. The method's accuracy is directly verified against known analytical solutions. "
"We give a distance estimate for the metric on the disk complex and show that it is Gromov hyperbolic. As another application of our techniques, we find an algorithm which computes the Hempel distance of a Heegaard splitting, up to an error depending only on the genus. "
"We obtain an upper bound on the minimal number of points in an $\eps$-chain joining two points in a metric space. This generalizes a bound due to Hambly and Kumagai (1999) for the case of resistance metric on certain self-similar fractals. As an application, we deduce a condition on $\eps$-chains introduced by Grigor'yan and Telcs (2012). This allows us to obtain sharp bounds on the heat kernel for spaces satisfying the parabolic Harnack inequality without assuming further conditions on the metric. A snowflake transform on the Euclidean space shows that our bound is sharp. "
We investigate the rational approximation of fractional powers of unbounded positive operators attainable with a specific integral representation of the operator function. We provide accurate error bounds by exploiting classical results in approximation theory involving Pad\'{e} approximants. The analysis improves some existing results and the numerical experiments proves its accuracy.
"Three types of BaTiO3 core - amorphous nano-shell composite ceramics were processed from the same core-shell powder by standard sintering, spark-plasma sintering and two-step sintering techniques and characterized by XRD, HRSEM and broad-band dielectric spectroscopy in the frequency range 10^3 - 10^13 Hz including the THz and IR range. The samples differed by porosity and by the amount of interdiffusion from the cores to shells, in correlation with their increasing porosity. The dielectric spectra were also calculated using suitable models based on effective medium approximation. The measurements revealed a strong dielectric dispersion below the THz range, which cannot be explained by the modeling, and whose strength was in correlation with the degree of interdiffusion. We assigned it to an effect of the interdiffusion layers, giving rise to a strong interfacial polarization. It appears that the high-frequency dielectric spectroscopy is an extremely sensitive tool for detection of any gradient layers and sample inhomogeneities even in dielectric materials with negligible conductivity. "
Honesty has never been scientifically proved to be the best policy in any case. It is pointed out that only honest person can prevent his dishonest partner to bias the outcome of quantum coin tossing.
"Due to the flexibility and adaptability of human, manual handling work is still very important in industry, especially for assembly and maintenance work. Well-designed work operation can improve work efficiency and quality; enhance safety, and lower cost. Most traditional methods for work system analysis need physical mock-up and are time consuming. Digital mockup (DMU) and digital human modeling (DHM) techniques have been developed to assist ergonomic design and evaluation for a specific worker population (e.g. 95 percentile); however, the operation adaptability and adjustability for a specific individual are not considered enough. In this study, a new framework based on motion tracking technique and digital human simulation technique is proposed for motion-time analysis of manual operations. A motion tracking system is used to track a worker's operation while he/she is conducting a manual handling work. The motion data is transferred to a simulation computer for real time digital human simulation. The data is also used for motion type recognition and analysis either online or offline for objective work efficiency evaluation and subjective work task evaluation. Methods for automatic motion recognition and analysis are presented. Constraints and limitations of the proposed method are discussed. "
"The responsivity and noise of a voltage-biased superconducting transition-edge sensor depends strongly on the details of its thermal model, and the simplest theory for TES response assumes a single heat capacity connected to the heat bath. Here, analytical results are derived and discussed for the complex impedance, the responsivity and the noise of a transition-edge sensor, when the thermal model is not simple but consists of either two or three connected heat capacities. The implications of the differences of the models are discussed, as well. "
The incorporation site of Er dopants inserted at high and low concentration (respectively 5 and 0.5 mol %) in nanoparticles of CaF 2 is studied by X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) at the Er L III edge. The experimental data are compared with the results of structural modeling based on Density Functional Theory (DFT). DFT-based molecular dynamics is also used to simulate complete theoretical EXAFS spectra of the model structures. The results is that Er substitutes for Ca in the structure and in the low concentration case the dopant ions are isolated. At high concentration the rare earth ions cluster together binding Ca vacancies.
"Mirror Symmetry, Picard-Fuchs equations and instanton corrected Yukawa couplings are discussed within the framework of toric geometry. It allows to establish mirror symmetry of Calabi-Yau spaces for which the mirror manifold had been unavailable in previous constructions. Mirror maps and Yukawa couplings are explicitly given for several examples with two and three moduli. "
"We derive stringent constraints on the persistent source associated with FRB 121102: Size $10^{17}$ cm $<R<10^{18}$ cm, age $<300$ yr, characteristic electron energy $\varepsilon_e\sim0.3$ GeV, total energy $\sim10^{49}$ erg. The hot radiating plasma is confined by a cold plasma of mass $M_c<0.03 (R/10^{17.5}{\rm cm})^4 M_\odot$. The source is nearly resolved, and may be resolved by 10 GHz observations. The fact that $\varepsilon_e\sim m_p c^2$ suggests that the hot plasma was created by the ejection of a mildly relativistic, $M\sim10^{-5} M_\odot$ shell, which propagated into an extended ambient medium or collided with a pre-ejected shell of mass $M_c$. The inferred plasma properties are inconsistent with typical ""magnetar wind nebulae"" model predictions. We suggest a physical mechanism for the generation of FRBs (independent of the persistent source model): Ejection from an underlying compact object, $R_s\sim10^{6}$ cm, of highly relativistic shells, with energy $E_s=10^{41}$ erg and Lorentz factor $\gamma_s$~$10^3$, into a surrounding e-p plasma with density $n\sim0.1/cm^3$ (consistent with that inferred for the plasma producing the persistent emission associated with FRB 121102). Such shell ejections with energy typical for FRB events lead to plasma conditions appropriate for strong synchrotron maser emission at the GHz range, $\nu_{ coh.}\sim0.5(E/10^{41}erg)^{1/4}$ GHz. In this model, a significant fraction of the deposited energy is converted to an FRB with duration $R_s/c$, accompanied by ~10 MeV photons carrying less energy than the FRB. The inferred energy and mass associated with the source are low compared to those of typical supernova ejecta. This may suggest some type of a ""weak stellar explosion"", where a neutron star is formed with relatively low mass and energy ejection. However, the current upper limit on R does not allow one to rule out $M_c\sim1M_\odot$. "
"We study the solar capture rate of inelastic dark matter with endothermic and/or exothermic interactions. By assuming that an inelastic dark matter signal will be observed in next generation direct detection experiments we can set a lower bound on the capture rate that is independent of the local dark matter density, the velocity distribution, the galactic escape velocity as well as the scattering cross section. In combination with upper limits from neutrino observatories we can place upper bounds on the annihilation channels leading to neutrinos. We find that, while endothermic scattering limits are weak in the isospin-conserving case, strong bounds may be set for exothermic interactions, in particular in the spin-dependent case. Furthermore, we study the implications of observing two direct detection signals, in which case one can halo-independently obtain the dark matter mass and the mass splitting, and disentangle the endothermic/exothermic nature of the scattering. Finally we discuss isospin violation. "
"We propose a lateral spin-blockade device that uses an InGaAs/InAlAs double quantum well (DQW), where the values of the Rashba spin-orbit parameter $\alpha_{\rm R}$ are opposite in sign but equal in magnitude between the constituent quantum wells (QW). By tuning the channel length of DQW and the magnitude of the externally applied in-plane magnetic field, one can block the transmission of one spin (e.g., spin-down) component, leading to a spin-polarized current. Such a spin-blocking effect, brought about by wave vector matching of the spin-split Fermi surfaces between the two QWs, paves the way for a new scheme of spin-polarized electric current generation for future spintronics applications based on semiconductor band engineering. "
Multiparton interactions modify the high energy hadronic cross section to produce minijets with a rapidity gap in the distribution of secondaries. At Tevatron energy the correction to the single scattering term is large for transverse momenta smaller than 6 GeV.
"For $A \subseteq \mathbb{N}$, the question of when $R(A) = \{a/a' : a, a' \in A\}$ is dense in the positive real numbers $\mathbb{R}_+$ has been examined by many authors over the years. In contrast, the $p$-adic setting is largely unexplored. We investigate conditions under which $R(A)$ is dense in the $p$-adic numbers. Techniques from elementary, algebraic, and analytic number theory are employed in this endeavor. We also pose many open questions that should be of general interest. "
In this Comment I point out some limitations of the proposal of Prezhdo and Brooksby for coupling quantum and classical degrees of freedom (Phys.Rev.Lett.86(2001)3215) if it is pushed too far.
"Solar and atmospheric evidences have been established and can be explained by neutrino masses. Furthermore, other experiments claim a few unconfirmed neutrino anomalies. We critically reanalyze the 0nu2beta, LSND and NuTeV anomalies. "
"An inhomogeneous Tricomi equation is considered in a strip with a polynomial right-hand side. It is shown that the Dirichlet boundary value problem with polynomial boundary conditions has a polynomial solution. An algorithm for constructing this polynomial solution is given and examples are considered. If the strip lies in the ellipticity region of the equation, then this solution is unique in the class of functions of polynomial growth. If the strip lies in a mixed region, then the solution of the Dirichlet problem is not unique in the class of functions of polynomial growth, but it is unique in the class of polynomials. "
"The smallest integer t for which the Wilson loop W^{t} fails to exhibit area law is known as the confinement index of a given field theory. The confinement index provides us with subtle information on the vacuum properties of the system. We study the behavior of the Wilson and 't Hooft loops and compute the confinement index in a wide class of N=1 supersymmetric gauge theories. All possible electric and magnetic screenings are taken into account. The results found are consistent with the theta periodicity, and whenever such a check is available, with the factorization property of Seiberg-Witten curves. "
"In [1] we gave a precise holographic calculation of chaos at the scrambling time scale. We studied the influence of a small perturbation, long in the past, on a two-sided correlation function in the thermofield double state. A similar analysis applies to squared commutators and other out-of-time-order one-sided correlators [2-4]. The essential bulk physics is a high energy scattering problem near the horizon of an AdS black hole. The above papers used Einstein gravity to study this problem; in the present paper we consider stringy and Planckian corrections. Elastic stringy corrections play an important role, effectively weakening and smearing out the development of chaos. We discuss their signature in the boundary field theory, commenting on the extension to weak coupling. Inelastic effects, although important for the evolution of the state, leave a parametrically small imprint on the correlators that we study. We briefly discuss ways to diagnose these small corrections, and we propose another correlator where inelastic effects are order one. "
"We performed a systematic search for stellar tidal disruption events (TDE) by looking for X-ray sources that were detected during the ROSAT All Sky Survey and faded by more than an order of magnitude over the next two decades according to XMM-Newton serendipitous observations. Besides a number of highly variable persistent X-ray sources (like active galactic nuclei and cataclysmic variables), we found three sources that are broadly consistent with the TDE scenario: 1RXS J114727.1+494302, 1RXS J130547.2+641252, and 1RXS J235424.5-102053. A TDE association is also acceptable for the fourth source, 1RXS J112312.7+012858, but an AGN origin cannot be ruled out either. This statistics implies a TDE rate of $ \sim 3\times 10^{-5} $ yr$ ^{-1} $ per galaxy in the Universe within $z\sim 0.18$, which is broadly consistent with the estimates of the TDE rate in the more local Universe obtained previously. "
"We calculate the structure of neutron star interiors comprising both the hadronic and the quark phases. For the hadronic sector we employ a microscopic equation of state involving nucleons and hyperons derived within the Brueckner-Hartree-Fock many-body theory with realistic two-body and three-body forces. For the description of quark matter, we use several different models, e.g. the MIT bag, the Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (NJL), the Color Dielectric (CDM), the Field Correlator method (FCM), and one based on the Dyson-Schwinger model (DSM). We find that a two solar mass hybrid star is possible only if the nucleonic EOS is stiff enough. "
"In this paper, we study the design and the delay-exponent of anytime codes over a three terminal relay network. We propose a bilayer anytime code based on anytime spatially coupled low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes and investigate the anytime characteristics through density evolution analysis. By using mathematical induction technique, we find analytical expressions of the delay-exponent for the proposed code. Through comparison, we show that the analytical delay-exponent has a close match with the delay-exponent obtained from numerical results. "
"We show that the shortfall risk of binomial approximations of game (Israeli) options converges to the shortfall risk in the corresponding Black--Scholes market considering Lipschitz continuous path-dependent payoffs for both discrete- and continuous-time cases. These results are new also for usual American style options. The paper continues and extends the study of Kifer [Ann. Appl. Probab. 16 (2006) 984--1033] where estimates for binomial approximations of prices of game options were obtained. Our arguments rely, in particular, on strong invariance principle type approximations via the Skorokhod embedding, estimates from Kifer [Ann. Appl. Probab. 16 (2006) 984--1033] and the existence of optimal shortfall hedging in the discrete time established by Dolinsky and Kifer [Stochastics 79 (2007) 169--195]. "
"We demonstrate quantum information can be transferred between two distant participants without any physical particles travelling between them. The key procedure of the counterfactual scheme is to entangle two nonlocal qubits with each other without interaction, so the scheme can also be used to generate nonlocal entanglement counterfactually. We here illustrate the scheme by using flying photon qubits and stationary electron-spin qubits assisted by quantum dots inside double-sided optical microcavities. Unlike the typical teleportation, the present scheme does not require prior entanglement sharing or classical communication between the two distant participants. "
"We report new correlations between ratios of band intensities of the 15-20 {\mu}m emission bands of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in a sample of fifty-seven sources observed with Spitzer/IRS. This sample includes Large Magellanic Cloud point sources from the SAGE-Spec survey, nearby galaxies from the SINGS survey, two Galactic ISM cirrus sources and the spectral maps of the Galactic reflection nebulae NGC 2023 and NGC 7023. We find that the 16.4, 17.4 and 17.8 {\mu}m band intensities are inter-correlated in all environments. In NGC 2023 and NGC 7023 these bands also correlate with the 11.0 and 12.7 {\mu}m band intensities. The 15.8 {\mu}m band correlates only with the 15-20 {\mu}m plateau and the 11.2 {\mu}m emission. We examine the spatial morphology of these bands and introduce radial cuts. We find that these bands can be spatially organized into three sets: the 12.7, 16.4 and 17.8 {\mu}m bands; the 11.2, 15.8 {\mu}m bands and the 15-18 {\mu}m plateau; and the 11.0 and 17.4 {\mu}m bands. We also find that the spatial distribution of the 12.7, 16.4 and 17.8 {\mu}m bands can be reconstructed by averaging the spatial distributions of the cationic 11.0 {\mu}m and neutral 11.2 {\mu}m bands. We conclude that the 17.4 {\mu}m band is dominated by cations, the 15.8 {\mu}m band by neutral species, and the 12.7, 16.4 and 17.8 {\mu}m bands by a combination of the two. These results highlight the importance of PAH ionization for spatially differentiating sub-populations by their 15-20 {\mu}m emission variability. "
"Service robots are complex, heterogeneous, software intensive systems built from components. Recent robotics research trends mainly address isolated capabilities on functional level. Non-functional properties, such as responsiveness or deterministic behavior, are addressed only in isolation (if at all). We argue that handling such non-functional properties on system level is a crucial next step. We claim that precise control over application-specific, dynamic execution and interaction behavior of functional components -- i.e. clear computation and communication semantics on model level without hidden code-defined parts -- is a key ingredient thereto. In this paper, we propose modeling concepts for these semantics, and present a meta-model which (i) enables component developers to implement component functionalities without presuming application-specific, system-level attributes, and (ii) enables system integrators to reason about causal dependencies between components as well as system-level data-flow characteristics. This allows to control data-propagation semantics and system properties such as end-to-end latencies during system integration without breaking component encapsulation. "
We study the singular limit of a spatially inhomogeneous and anisotropic reaction-diffusion equation. We use a Finsler metric related to the anisotropic diffusion term and work in relative geometry. We prove a weak comparison principle and perform an analysis of both the generation and the motion of interfaces. The limit problem involves motion by anisotropic mean curvature. We also prove an optimal estimate of the thickness of the transition layer.
"The effect of threshold singularities induced by unstable particles on two-loop observables is investigated and it is shown how to cure them working in the complex-mass scheme. The impact on radiative corrections around thresholds is thoroughly analyzed and shown to be relevant for two selected LHC and ILC applications: Higgs production via gluon fusion and decay into two photons at two loops in the Standard Model. Concerning Higgs production, it is essential to understand possible sources of large corrections in addition to the well-known QCD effects. It is shown that NLO electroweak corrections can incongruently reach a 10 % level around the WW vector-boson threshold without a complete implementation of the complex-mass scheme in the two-loop calculation. "
"Concept drift is formally defined as the change in joint distribution of a set of input variables X and a target variable y. The two types of drift that are extensively studied are real drift and virtual drift where the former is the change in posterior probabilities p(y|X) while the latter is the change in distribution of X without affecting the posterior probabilities. Many approaches on concept drift detection either assume full availability of data labels, y or handle only the virtual drift. In a streaming environment, the assumption of full availability of data labels, y is questioned. On the other hand, approaches that deal with virtual drift failed to address real drift. Rather than improving the state-of-the-art methods, this paper presents a semi-supervised framework to deal with the challenges above. The objective of the proposed framework is to learn from streaming environment with limited data labels, y and detect real drift concurrently. This paper proposes a novel concept drift detection method utilizing the densities of posterior probabilities in partially labeled streaming environments. Experimental results on both synthetic and realworld datasets show that our proposed semi-supervised framework enables the detection of concept drift in such environment while achieving comparable prediction performance to the state-of-the-art methods.

"With the advances in high resolution and spin-resolved scanning tunneling microscopy as well as atomic-scale manipulation, it has become possible to create and characterize quantum states of matter bottom-up, atom-by-atom. This is largely based on controlling the particle- or wave-like nature of electrons, as well as the interactions between spins, electrons, and orbitals and their interplay with structure and dimensionality. We review the recent advances in creating artificial electronic and spin lattices that lead to various exotic quantum phases of matter, ranging from topological Dirac dispersion to complex magnetic order. We also project future perspectives in non-equilibrium dynamics, prototype technologies, engineered quantum phase transitions and topology, as well as the evolution of complexity from simplicity in this newly developing field. "
"This paper studies the projected saddle-point dynamics associated to a convex-concave function, which we term saddle function. The dynamics consists of gradient descent of the saddle function in variables corresponding to convexity and (projected) gradient ascent in variables corresponding to concavity. We examine the role that the local and/or global nature of the convexity-concavity properties of the saddle function plays in guaranteeing convergence and robustness of the dynamics. Under the assumption that the saddle function is twice continuously differentiable, we provide a novel characterization of the omega-limit set of the trajectories of this dynamics in terms of the diagonal blocks of the Hessian. Using this characterization, we establish global asymptotic convergence of the dynamics under local strong convexity-concavity of the saddle function. When strong convexity-concavity holds globally, we establish three results. First, we identify a Lyapunov function (that decreases strictly along the trajectory) for the projected saddle-point dynamics when the saddle function corresponds to the Lagrangian of a general constrained convex optimization problem. Second, for the particular case when the saddle function is the Lagrangian of an equality-constrained optimization problem, we show input-to-state stability of the saddle-point dynamics by providing an ISS Lyapunov function. Third, we use the latter result to design an opportunistic state-triggered implementation of the dynamics. Various examples illustrate our results. "
"We study macroevolutionary dynamics by extending microevolutionary competition models to long time scales. It has been shown that for a general class of competition models, gradual evolutionary change in continuous phenotypes (evolutionary dynamics) can be non-stationary and even chaotic when the dimension of the phenotype space in which the evolutionary dynamics unfold is high. It has also been shown that evolutionary diversification can occur along non-equilibrium trajectories in phenotype space. We combine these lines of thinking by studying long-term coevolutionary dynamics of emerging lineages in multi-dimensional phenotype spaces. We use a statistical approach to investigate the evolutionary dynamics of many different systems. We find: 1) for a given dimension of phenotype space, the coevolutionary dynamics tends to be fast and non-stationary for an intermediate number of coexisting lineages, but tends to stabilize as the evolving communities reach a saturation level of diversity; and 2) the amount of diversity at the saturation level increases rapidly (exponentially) with the dimension of phenotype space. These results have implications for theoretical perspectives on major macroevolutionary patterns such as adaptive radiation, long-term temporal patterns of phenotypic changes, and the evolution of diversity.

"Motivated by the new Laplace transforms for the Kummer's confluent hypergeometric functions $_1F_1$ obtained recently by Kim et al. [Math $\&$ Comput. Modelling, 55 (2012), pp. 1068--1071], the authors aim is to establish so far unknown Laplace transforms of rather general case of generalized hypergeometric functions $_2F_2(x)$ and $_3F_3(x)$ by employing extensions of classical summation theorems for the series $_2F_1$ and $_3F_2$ obtained recently by Kim et al. [Int. J. Math. Math. Sci., 309503, 26 pages, 2010]. Certain known results obtained earlier by Kim et al. follow cases of our main findings. "
"The absolute visual magnitude as function of the observed colour (B-V), also named Hertzsprung-Russell diagram can be described through five equations; that in presence of calibrated stars means eight constants. The developed framework allows to deduce the remaining physical parameters that are mass, radius and luminosity. This new technique is applied to the first 10 pc, the first 50 pc, the Hyades and to the determination of the distance of a cluster. The case of the white dwarfs is analysed assuming the absence of calibrated data: our equation produces a smaller $\chi^2$ in respect to the standard colour-magnitude calibration when applied to the Villanova Catalog of Spectroscopically Identified White Dwarfs. The theoretical basis of the formulae for the colours and the bolometric correction of the stars are clarified through a Taylor expansion in the temperature of the Planck distribution. "
"We study the classical problem of prediction with expert advice in the adversarial setting with a geometric stopping time. In 1965, Cover gave the optimal algorithm for the case of 2 experts. In this paper, we design the optimal algorithm, adversary and regret for the case of 3 experts. Further, we show that the optimal algorithm for $2$ and $3$ experts is a probability matching algorithm (analogous to Thompson sampling) against a particular randomized adversary. Remarkably, our proof shows that the probability matching algorithm is not only optimal against this particular randomized adversary, but also minimax optimal. Our analysis develops upper and lower bounds simultaneously, analogous to the primal-dual method. Our analysis of the optimal adversary goes through delicate asymptotics of the random walk of a particle between multiple walls. We use the connection we develop to random walks to derive an improved algorithm and regret bound for the case of $4$ experts, and, provide a general framework for designing the optimal algorithm and adversary for an arbitrary number of experts.

"Chase-escape is a competitive growth process in which red particles spread to adjacent uncolored sites while blue particles overtake adjacent red particles. This can be thought of as prey escaping from pursuing predators. On d-ary trees, we introduce the modification that red particles die and describe the phase diagram for red and blue particle survival as the death rate is varied. Our analysis includes the behavior at criticality, which is different than what occurs in the process without death. Many of our results rely on novel connections to weighted Catalan numbers and analytic combinatorics. "
"In this paper we outline the computation of the partition function for the generalized Kodama states (GKod) of quantum gravity using the background field method. We show that the coupling constant for GKod is the same dimensionless coupling constant that appears in the partition function of the pure Kodama state (Chern--Simons functional) and argue that the GKod partition function is renormalizable as a loop expansion in direct analogy to Chern--Simons perturbation theory. The GKod partition function contains an infinite set of 1PI vertices uniquely fixed, as a result of the semiclassical-quantum correspondence, by the first-order vertex. This implies the existence of a well-defined effective action for the partition function since the `phase' of the GKod, provided a finite state exists, is equivalent to this effective action. Additionally, the separation of the matter from the gravitational contributions bears a resemblance to the infinite dimensional analogue to Kaluza--Klein theory. Future directions of research include extension of the computations of this paper to the norm of the GKod as well as to examine the analogue of the Chern--Simons Jone's polynomials and link invariants using the GKod as a measure. "
"The paper presents some distributional properties of logistic order statistics subject to independent exponential one-sided and two-sided shifts. Utilizing these properties, we extend several known results and obtain some new characterizations of the logistic distribution. "
"We study the correlation and response dynamics of trap models of glassy dynamics, considering observables that only partially decorrelate with every jump. This is inspired by recent work on a microscopic realization of such models, which found strikingly simple linear out-of-equilibrium fluctuation-dissipation relations in the limit of slow decorrelation. For the Barrat-Mezard model with its entropic barriers we obtain exact results at zero temperature $T$ for arbitrary decorrelation factor $\kappa$. These are then extended to nonzero $T$, where the qualitative scaling behaviour and all scaling exponents can still be found analytically. Unexpectedly, the choice of transition rates (Glauber versus Metropolis) affects not just prefactors but also some exponents. In the limit of slow decorrelation even complete scaling functions are accessible in closed form. The results show that slowly decorrelating observables detect persistently slow out-of-equilibrium dynamics, as opposed to intermittent behaviour punctuated by excursions into fast, effectively equilibrated states. "
"We consider an oblique incidence on a uniform dielectric layer of the plane monochromatic TE- and TM-waves, as well as TE- and TM-polarized wave packets consisting of waves with the same angle of incidence. For each polarization the stationary model is presented, which allows one to uniquely restore the dynamics of the transmitted and reflected components of the incident wave packet at all stages of scattering. On this basis we introduce the concepts of ``true group-delay time""\/ and ``false group-delay time""\/ (the corresponding quantities for transmission and reflection are the same). The former is defined as the difference of two instants in the evolution of the same wave packet, one of which cannot be measured directly. Conversely, the latter is defined as the difference of two instants in the evolution of different wave packets, both can be measured directly. The false group-delay time does not in itself have a physical sense, but plays a key role for an indirect measurement of the true group-delay times of both polarizations. "
"Modern architectures require applications to make effective use of caches to achieve high performance and hide memory latency. This in turn requires careful consideration of placement of data in memory to exploit spatial locality, leverage hardware prefetching and conserve memory bandwidth. In unmanaged languages like C++, memory optimisations are common, but at the cost of losing object abstraction and memory safety. In managed languages like Java and C#, the abstract view of memory and proliferation of moving compacting garbage collection does not provide enough control over placement and layout. We have proposed SHAPES, a type-driven abstract placement specification that can be integrated with object-oriented languages to enable memory optimisations. SHAPES preserves both memory and object abstraction. In this paper, we formally specify the SHAPES semantics and describe its memory safety model. "
"In this article, we consider mild solutions to a class of impulsive fractional evolution equations of order $0<\alpha<1$. After analyzing analytic results reported in the literature using Mittag-Leffer function, $\alpha$-resolvent operator theory, we propose a more appropriate new definition of mild solutions for impulsive fractional evolution equations by replacing the impulse term operator $S_\alpha(t-t_i)$ with $S_\alpha(t)S_\alpha^{-1}(t_i)$, where $S_\alpha^{-1}(t_i)$ denotes the inverse of the fractional solution operator $S_\alpha(t)$ at $t=t_i, (i=1,2,\cdots m)$. "
"We propose the idea that time evolution of quantum systems is driven by work. The formalism presented here falls within the scope of a recently proposed theory of gravitating quantum matter where extractible work, and not energy, is responsible for gravitation. Our main assumption is that extractible work, and not the Hamiltonian, dictates dynamics. We find that expectation values of meaningful quantities, such as the occupation number, deviate from those predicted by standard quantum mechanics. The scope, applications and validity of this proposal are also discussed. "
"We study the problem of learning choice functions, which play an important role in various domains of application, most notably in the field of economics. Formally, a choice function is a mapping from sets to sets: Given a set of choice alternatives as input, a choice function identifies a subset of most preferred elements. Learning choice functions from suitable training data comes with a number of challenges. For example, the sets provided as input and the subsets produced as output can be of any size. Moreover, since the order in which alternatives are presented is irrelevant, a choice function should be symmetric. Perhaps most importantly, choice functions are naturally context-dependent, in the sense that the preference in favor of an alternative may depend on what other options are available. We formalize the problem of learning choice functions and present two general approaches based on two representations of context-dependent utility functions. Both approaches are instantiated by means of appropriate neural network architectures, and their performance is demonstrated on suitable benchmark tasks. "
"The purposes of this work are to construct a class of homogeneous vertex representations of $C_l^{(1)} \ (l\geq2)$, and to derive a series of product-sum identities. These identities have fine interpretation in number theory. "
"We report an approach for determination of zero-field splitting parameters from four-component relativistic calculations. Our approach involves neither perturbative treatment of spin-orbit interaction nor truncation of the spin-orbit coupled states. We make use of a multi-state implementation of relativistic complete active space perturbation theory (CASPT2), partially contracted N-electron valence perturbation theory (NEVPT2), and multi-reference configuration interaction theory (MRCI), all with the fully internally contracted ansatz. A mapping is performed from the Dirac Hamiltonian to the pseudospin Hamiltonian, using correlated energies and the magnetic moment matrix elements of the reference wavefunctions. Direct spin-spin coupling is naturally included through the full 2-electron Breit interaction. Benchmark calculations on chalcogen diatomics and pseudotetrahedral cobalt(II) complexes show accuracy comparable to the commonly used state-interaction with spin-orbit (SI-SO) approach, while tests on a uranium(III) single-ion magnet suggest that for actinide complexes the strengths of our approach through the more robust treatment of spin-orbit effects and the avoidence of state truncation are of greater importance. "
"The deep inelastic scattering 2+1 jet cross- section is a useful observable for precision tests of QCD, e.g. measuring the strong coupling constant alpha(s). A consistent analysis requires a good understanding of the theoretical uncertainties and one of the most fundamental ones in QCD is due to the renormalization scheme and scale ambiguity. Different methods, which have been proposed to resolve the scale ambiguity, are applied to the 2+1 jet cross-section and the uncertainty is estimated. It is shown that the uncertainty can be made smaller by choosing the jet definition in a suitable way. "
"On the basis of perturbation theory in fine structure constant alpha and the ratio of electron to muon masses we calculate one-loop vacuum polarization, electron vertex corrections, nuclear structure and recoil corrections to hyperfine splitting of the ground state in muonic lithium ions $(\mu\ e\ ^6_3Li)^+$ and $(\mu\ e\ ^7_3Li)^+$. We obtain total results for the ground state small hyperfine splittings in $(\mu\ e\ ^6_3Li)^+$ $\Delta\nu_1=21572.16$ MHz and $\Delta\nu_2=14152.56$ MHz and in $(\mu\ e\ ^7_3Li)^+$ $\Delta\nu_1=21733.06$ MHz and $\Delta\nu_2=13994.35$ MHz which can be considered as a reliable estimate for a comparison with future experimental data. "
"A new efficient algorithm is proposed for factoring polynomials over an algebraic extension field. The extension field is defined by a polynomial ring modulo a maximal ideal. If the maximal ideal is given by its Groebner basis, no extra Groebner basis computation is needed for factoring a polynomial over this extension field. Nothing more than linear algebraic technique is used to get a polynomial over the ground field by a generic linear map. Then this polynomial is factorized over the ground field. From these factors, the factorization of the polynomial over the extension field is obtained. The new algorithm has been implemented and computer experiments indicate that the new algorithm is very efficient, particularly in complicated examples. "
"We perform a stability analysis of a tidally excited nonlinear internal gravity wave near the centre of a solar-type star in two-dimensions. The motivation is to understand the tidal interaction between short-period planets and their solar-type host stars, which involves the launching of gravity waves at the top of the radiation zone that propagate towards the stellar centre. Studying the instabilities of these waves near the centre, where nonlinearities are most important, is essential, since it may have implications for the survival of these planets. When the waves have sufficient amplitude to overturn the stratification, they break and form a critical layer, which efficiently absorbs subsequent ingoing wave angular momentum, and can result in the planet spiralling into the star. However, previous simulations do not find the waves to undergo instability for smaller amplitudes. This work has two aims: to determine any instabilities that set in for small-amplitude waves, and to further understand the breaking of large-amplitude waves. Our main result is that the waves undergo parametric instabilities for any amplitude. However, because the nonlinearity is spatially localised in the innermost wavelengths, their growth rates are sufficiently small that they do not result in astrophysically important tidal dissipation. The resulting modified tidal quality factors are estimated to be Q'_star>10^7, and possibly much greater, so the dissipation is much weaker than that which results from critical-layer absorption. These results support our explanation for the survival of all currently observed short-period planets around solar-type main-sequence stars: that planets unable to cause wave breaking at the centre of their host stars are likely to survive against tidal decay. This hypothesis will be tested by ongoing and future observations of transiting planets, such as WASP and Kepler. "
"The Institute for Science Information (ISI) has generated two lists of citation information for astronomers that are uniquely restricted both as to the years surveyed for the cited papers, and the years surveyed for the citing papers. The main list gives citation data for 62,813 physicists and astronomers whose journal papers were cited 100 times or more from 1981.0 to 1997.5 by papers published during the same time interval. The second list gives the 200 most-cited papers/year published in refereed astronomical journals from 1981-1996, as cited in papers in those same journals from 1981.0-1998.0. Astronomer names were selected from various sources. From this work an Astronomy Citation Database (ACD) has been constructed, containing citation data for 6458+ astronomers, plus additional data for 173 astronomers and the top-10 cited papers published 1981-1996. Various problems, both substantial and subtle, of producing a reasonably fair citation database are detailed. Chief among these are whether to assign either parital or full credit for each author on a given paper. Whether one is honored with one of the top astronomy lifetime-awards is a strong function of how well your work stands out as your own, and in what kind of publications you publish (e.g., the ISI does not keep track of papers in meeting proceedings/books/catalogs). Name confusion affects this kind of analysis to the extent that that it would take an enormous effort to disentangle its effects and, even then, not all name confusion would be settled. A ``modest proposal'' is made that our professional field (and others) go to a system of uniquely associating an identification number to each author on each paper to solve the name confusion problem.

"We present a hundred-watt-level linearly-polarized random fiber laser (RFL) pumped by incoherent broadband amplified spontaneous emission (ASE) source and prospect the power scaling potential theoretically. The RFL employs half-opened cavity structure which is composed by a section of 330 m polarization maintained (PM) passive fiber and two PM high reflectivity fiber Bragg gratings. The 2nd order Stokes light centered at 1178 nm reaches the pump limited maximal power of 100.7 W with a full width at half-maximum linewidth of 2.58 nm and polarization extinction ratio of 23.5 dB. The corresponding ultimate quantum efficiency of pump to 2nd order Stokes light is 89.01%. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of linearly-polarized high-order RFL with hundred-watt output power. Furthermore, the theoretical investigation indicates that 300 W-level linearly-polarized single-mode 1st order Stokes light can be obtained from incoherently pumped RFL with 100 m PM passive fiber. "
"Scene Parsing is a crucial step to enable autonomous systems to understand and interact with their surroundings. Supervised deep learning methods have made great progress in solving scene parsing problems, however, come at the cost of laborious manual pixel-level annotation. To alleviate this effort synthetic data as well as weak supervision have both been investigated. Nonetheless, synthetically generated data still suffers from severe domain shift while weak labels are often imprecise. Moreover, most existing works for weakly supervised scene parsing are limited to salient foreground objects. The aim of this work is hence twofold: Exploit synthetic data where feasible and integrate weak supervision where necessary. More concretely, we address this goal by utilizing depth as transfer domain because its synthetic-to-real discrepancy is much lower than for color. At the same time, we perform weak localization from easily obtainable image level labels and integrate both using a novel contour-based scheme. Our approach is implemented as a teacher-student learning framework to solve the transfer learning problem by generating a pseudo ground truth. Using only depth-based adaptation, this approach already outperforms previous transfer learning approaches on the popular indoor scene parsing SUN RGB-D dataset. Our proposed two-stage integration more than halves the gap towards fully supervised methods when compared to previous state-of-the-art in transfer learning. "
"Identity management systems (IDMSs) are widely used to provision user identities while managing authentication, authorization, and data sharing both within organizations as well as on the Internet more broadly. Traditional identity systems typically suffer from single points of failure, lack of interoperability, and privacy issues such as encouraging mass data collection and user tracking. Blockchain technology has the potential to support novel data ownership and governance models with built-in control and consent mechanisms, which may benefit both users and businesses by alleviating these concerns; as a result, blockchain-based IDMSs are beginning to proliferate. This work categorizes these systems into a taxonomy based on differences in architecture, governance models, and other salient features. We provide context for the taxonomy by describing related terms, emerging standards, and use cases, while highlighting relevant security and privacy considerations. "
"The spectroscopy of free radicals and radical containing entrance-channel complexes embedded in superfluid helium nano-droplets is reviewed. The collection of dopants inside individual droplets in the beam represents a micro-canonical ensemble, and as such each droplet may be considered an isolated cryo-reactor. The unique properties of the droplets, namely their low temperature (0.4 K) and fast cooling rates ($\sim10^{16}$ K s$^{-1}$) provides novel opportunities for the formation and high-resolution studies of molecular complexes containing one or more free radicals. The production methods of radicals are discussed in light of their applicability for embedding the radicals in helium droplets. The spectroscopic studies performed to date on molecular radicals and on entrance / exit-channel complexes of radicals with stable molecules are detailed. The observed complexes provide new information on the potential energy surfaces of several fundamental chemical reactions and on the intermolecular interactions present in open-shell systems. Prospects of further experiments of radicals embedded in helium droplets are discussed, especially the possibilities to prepare and study high-energy structures and their controlled manipulation, as well as the possibility of fundamental physics experiments.

"The first law for the holographic entanglement entropy of spheres in a boundary CFT with a bulk Lovelock dual is extended to include variations of the bulk Lovelock coupling constants. Such variations in the bulk correspond to perturbations within a family of boundary CFTs. The new contribution to the first law is found to be the product of the variation $\delta a$ of the A-type trace anomaly coefficient for even dimensional CFTs, or more generally its extension $\delta a^*$ to include odd dimensional boundaries, times the ratio $S/a^*$. Since $a^*$ is a measure of the number of degrees of freedom $N$ per unit volume of the boundary CFT, this new term has the form $\mu\delta N$, where the chemical potential $\mu$ is given by the entanglement entropy per degree of freedom.

"We use the field theoretical model to perform relativistic calculations of neutrino energy losses caused by the direct Urca processes on nucleons in the degenerate baryon matter. By our analysis, the direct neutron decay in the superdense nuclear matter under beta equilibrium is open only due to the isovector meson fields, which create a large energy gap between protons and neutrons in the medium. Our expression for the neutrino energy losses, obtained in the mean field approximation, incorporates the effects of nucleon recoil, parity violation, weak magnetism, and pseudoscalar interaction. For numerical testing of our formula, we use a self-consistent relativistic model of the multicomponent baryon matter. The relativistic emissivity of the direct Urca reactions is found substantially larger than predicted in the non-relativistic approach. We found that, due to weak magnetism effects, relativistic emissivities increase by approximately 40-50%, while the pseudoscalar interaction only slightly suppresses the energy losses, approximately by 5%. "
"Extreme black holes have been argued to be unstable, in the sense that under linearized gravitational perturbations of the extreme Kerr spacetime the Weyl scalar $\psi_4$ blows up along their event horizons at very late advanced times. We show numerically, by solving the Teukolsky equation in 2+1D, that all algebraically-independent curvature scalar polynomials approach limits that exist when advanced time along the event horizon approaches infinity. Therefore, the horizons of extreme black holes are stable against linearized gravitational perturbations. We argue that the divergence of $\psi_4$ is a consequence of the choice of a fixed tetrad, and that in a suitable dynamical tetrad all Weyl scalars, including $\psi_4$, approach their background extreme Kerr values. We make similar conclusions also for the case of scalar field perturbations of extreme Kerr. "
"Andreev's Problem states the following: Given an integer $d$ and a subset of $S \subseteq \mathbb{F}_q \times \mathbb{F}_q$, is there a polynomial $y = p(x)$ of degree at most $d$ such that for every $a \in \mathbb{F}_q$, $(a,p(a)) \in S$? We show an $\text{AC}^0[\oplus]$ lower bound for this problem. This problem appears to be similar to the list recovery problem for degree $d$-Reed-Solomon codes over $\mathbb{F}_q$ which states the following: Given subsets $A_1,\ldots,A_q$ of $\mathbb{F}_q$, output all (if any) the Reed-Solomon codewords contained in $A_1\times \cdots \times A_q$. For our purpose, we study this problem when $A_1, \ldots, A_q$ are random subsets of a given size, which may be of independent interest. "
"Water gas shift (WGS) reaction is a chemical reaction in which carbon monoxide reacts with water vapor to form carbon dioxide and hydrogen. It is an important reaction industrially used in conjunction with steam reforming of hydrocarbons for the production of high purity hydrogen. Grenoble et al examined the roles of both active metals and metal oxide support on the kinetics of the WGS reaction. They found out that the turn over numbers of various Al2O3 supported transition metals decreased in the trend of Cu, Re, Co, Ru, Ni, Pt, Os, Au, Fe, Pd, Rh, and Ir, which corresponds nicely to the observed volcano shaped correlation between catalytic activities and respective CO adsorption heat. This is a strong indication that CO gets activated on the metal surface during the reaction and different metals have different activation energies. The authors also observed that the turn over number of Pt/Al2O3 was one order of magnitude higher than that of Pt/SiO2, indicating a strong support effect, which the authors ascribed to the activation of H2O.

"We study the long-wavelength collective modes in the magnetic-field-induced spin-density-wave (FISDW) phases experimentally observed in organic conductors of the Bechgaard salts family, focusing on phases that exhibit a sign reversal of the quantum Hall effect (Ribault anomaly). We have recently proposed that two SDW's coexist in the Ribault phase, as a result of Umklapp processes. When the latter are strong enough, the two SDW's become circularly polarized (helicoidal SDW's). In this paper, we study the collective modes which result from the presence of two SDW's. We find two Goldstone modes, an out-of-phase sliding mode and an in-phase spin-wave mode, and two gapped modes. The sliding Goldstone mode carries only a fraction of the total optical spectral weight, which is determined by the ratio of the amplitude of the two SDW's. In the helicoidal phase, all the spectral weight is pushed up above the SDW gap. We also point out similarities with phase modes in two-band or bilayer superconductors. We expect our conclusions to hold for generic two-SDW systems. "
"Assuming that AXPs and SGRs accrete matter from a fallback disk, we attempt to explain both the soft and the hard X-ray emission as the result of the accretion process. We also attempt to explain their radio emission or the lack of it. We test the hypothesis that the power-law, hard X-ray spectra are produced in the accretion flow mainly by bulk-motion Comptonization of soft photons emitted at the neutron star surface. Fallback disk models invoke surface dipole magnetic fields of $10^{12} - 10^{13}$ G, which is what we assume here. Unlike normal X-ray pulsars, for which the accretion rate is highly super-Eddington, the accretion rate is approximately Eddington in AXPs and SGRs and thus the bulk-motion Comptonization operates efficiently. As an illustrative example we reproduce both the hard and the soft X-ray spectra of AXP 4U 0142+61 well using the XSPEC package compTB. Our model seems to explain both the hard and the soft X-ray spectra of AXPs and SGRs, as well as their radio emission or the lack of it, in a natural way. It might also explain the short bursts observed in these sources. On the other hand, it cannot explain the giant X-ray outbursts observed in SGRs, which may result from the conversion of magnetic energy in local multipole fields. "
"This paper is devoted to the problem of prescribing the scalar curvature under zero boundary conditions. Using dynamical and topological methods involving the study of critical points at infinity of the associated variational problem, we prove some existence results on the standard half sphere. "
"Context: In a series of papers, we study the major merger of two disk galaxies in order to establish whether or not such a merger can produce a disc galaxy. Aims: Our aim here is to describe in detail the technical aspects of our numerical experiments. Methods: We discuss the initial conditions of our major merger, which consist of two protogalaxies on a collision orbit. We show that such merger simulations can produce a non-realistic central mass concentration, and we propose simple, parametric, AGN-like feedback as a solution to this problem. Our AGN-like feedback algorithm is very simple: at each time-step we take all particles whose local volume density is above a given threshold value and increase their temperature to a preset value. We also compare the GADGET3 and GIZMO codes, by applying both of them to the same initial conditions. Results: We show that the evolution of isolated protogalaxies resembles the evolution of disk galaxies, thus arguing that our protogalaxies are well suited for our merger simulations. We demonstrate that the problem with the unphysical central mass concentration in our merger simulations is further aggravated when we increase the resolution. We show that our AGN-like feedback removes this non-physical central mass concentration, and thus allows the formation of realistic bars. Note that our AGN-like feedback mainly affects the central region of a model, without significantly modifying the rest of the galaxy. We demonstrate that, in the context of our kind of simulation, GADGET3 gives results which are very similar to those obtained with the PSPH (density independent SPH) flavor of GIZMO. Moreover, in the examples we tried, the differences between the results of the two flavors of GIZMO, namely PSPH, and MFM (mesh-less algorithm) are similar to and, in some comparisons, larger than the differences between the results of GADGET3 and PSPH.

"Today's wireless networks are increasingly crowded with an explosion of wireless users, who have greater and more diverse quality of service (QoS) demands than ever before. However, the amount of spectrum that can be used to satisfy these demands remains finite. This leads to a great challenge for wireless users to effectively share the spectrum to achieve their QoS requirements. This paper presents a game theoretic model for spectrum sharing, where users seek to satisfy their QoS demands in a distributed fashion. Our spectrum sharing model is quite general, because we allow different wireless channels to provide different QoS, depending upon their channel conditions and how many users are trying to access them. Also, users can be highly heterogeneous, with different QoS demands, depending upon their activities, hardware capabilities, and technology choices. Under such a general setting, we show that it is NP hard to find a spectrum allocation which satisfies the maximum number of users' QoS requirements in a centralized fashion. We also show that allowing users to self-organize through distributed channel selections is a viable alternative to the centralized optimization, because better response updating is guaranteed to reach a pure Nash equilibria in polynomial time. By bounding the price of anarchy, we demonstrate that the worst case pure Nash equilibrium can be close to optimal, when users and channels are not very heterogenous. We also extend our model by considering the frequency spatial reuse, and consider the user interactions as a game upon a graph where players only contend with their neighbors. We prove that better response updating is still guaranteed to reach a pure Nash equilibrium in this more general spatial QoS satisfaction game. "
"High quality, thin diamond membranes containing nitrogen-vacancy centers provide critical advantages in the fabrication of diamond-based structures for a variety of applications, including wide field magnetometry, photonics and bio-sensing. In this work we describe, in detail, the generation of thin, optically-active diamond membranes by means of ion implantation and overgrowth. To establish the suitability of our method for photonic applications, photonic crystal cavities with quality factor of 1000 are fabricated. "
"This paper is concerned with qualitative properties of solutions to nonlocal reaction-diffusion equations of the form$$ \int\_{\mathbb{R}^N\setminus K} J(x-y)\,\big( u(y)-u(x) \big)\,\D y+f(u(x))=0, \quad x\in\R^N\setminus K,$$set in a perforated open set $\mathbb{R}^N\setminus K$, where $K\subset\mathbb{R}^N$ is a bounded compact ""obstacle"" and $f$ is a bistable nonlinearity. When $K$ is convex, we prove some Liouville-type results for solutions satisfying some asymptotic limiting conditions at infinity. We also establish a robustness result, assuming slightly relaxed conditions on $K$. "
"The OPERA experiment has conclusively observed the appearance of tau neutrinos in the muon neutrino CNGS beam. Exploiting the OPERA detector capabilities, it was possible to isolate high purity samples of $\nu_{e}$, $\nu_{\mu}$ and $\nu_{\tau}$ charged current weak neutrino interactions, as well as neutral current weak interactions. In this Letter, the full dataset is used for the first time to test the three-flavor neutrino oscillation model and to derive constraints on the existence of a light sterile neutrino within the framework of the $3+1$ neutrino model. For the first time, tau and electron neutrino appearance channels are jointly used to test the sterile neutrino hypothesis. A significant fraction of the sterile neutrino parameter space allowed by LSND and MiniBooNE experiments is excluded at 90% C.L. In particular, the best-fit values obtained by MiniBooNE combining neutrino and antineutrino data are excluded at 3.3 $\sigma$ significance. "
"Sensitive searches for antineutrino oscillations in atmospheric mass parameter region much discussed in recent years are based on accurate comparison of the inverse beta decay positron spectra measured in two (or more) detectors, far and near, stationed e.g. at ~1000 m and ~100 m from the reactor(s). We show that antineutrinos emitted from the stored irradiated fuel can differently distort the soft part of positron spectra measured in the far and near detector and thus mimic (or hide) the oscillation signal "
This book is devoted to the spectral analysis of the magnetic Laplacian in various geometric situations. In particular the influence of the geometry on the discrete spectrum is analysed in many asymptotic regimes.
"The trace of the heat kernel in a (D+1)-dimensional Euclidean spacetime (integer D > 1) is used to derive the free energy in finite temperature field theory. The spacetime presents a D-dimensional compact space (domain) with a (D-1)-dimensional boundary, and a closed dimension, whose volume is proportional the Planck's inverse temperature. The thermal sum appears due to topology of the closed Euclidean time. The obtained free energy in (3+1) and (2+1) dimensions contain two contributions defined by the volume of a domain and by the volume of the domain's boundary. This functional is finite and valid for arbitrary values of the Planck's inverse temperature. The absolute zero of thermodynamic temperature is forbidden topologically, and no universal low temperature asymptotics of the free energy can exist. "
"Human motion capture data has been widely used in data-driven character animation. In order to generate realistic, natural-looking motions, most data-driven approaches require considerable efforts of pre-processing, including motion segmentation and annotation. Existing (semi-) automatic solutions either require hand-crafted features for motion segmentation or do not produce the semantic annotations required for motion synthesis and building large-scale motion databases. In addition, human labeled annotation data suffers from inter- and intra-labeler inconsistencies by design. We propose a semi-automatic framework for semantic segmentation of motion capture data based on supervised machine learning techniques. It first transforms a motion capture sequence into a ``motion image'' and applies a convolutional neural network for image segmentation. Dilated temporal convolutions enable the extraction of temporal information from a large receptive field. Our model outperforms two state-of-the-art models for action segmentation, as well as a popular network for sequence modeling. Most of all, our method is very robust under noisy and inaccurate training labels and thus can handle human errors during the labeling process. "
The results of a recent experiment measuring the reaction pp -> dK^+ \bar K^0 near threshold are interpreted in terms of a spectator model that encapsulates the main features of the observed K^+ \bar K^0 invariant mass distribution. A chi^2 fit to this data leads to an imaginary part of the isovector scattering length in the K \bar K channel of Im(a_1) = -(0.63 \pm 0.24) fm. We then use the Flatte representation of the scattering amplitude to infer a value Re(a_1) = -(0.02 \pm 0.02) fm for the real part under the assumption that scaling is approximately satisfied. We show further that it is not possible to exclude the effects of \pi^+\eta to K^+ \bar K^0 channel coupling within the context of our model.
"We introduce a weaker variant of the concept of three point property, which is equivalent to a non-linear local connectivity condition introduced in [12], sufficient to guarantee the extendability of a conformal map f from the unit disk onto a domain to the entire plane as a homeomorphism of locally exponentially integrable distortion. Sufficient conditions for extendability to a homeomorphism of locally p-integrable distortion are also given. "
"Currently, we have only limited means to probe the presence of planets at large orbital separations. Foreman-Mackey et al. searched for long-period transiting planets in the Kepler light curves using an automated pipeline. Here, we apply their pipeline, with minor modifications, to a larger sample and use updated stellar parameters from Gaia DR2. The latter boosts the stellar radii for most of the planet candidates found by FM16, invalidating a number of them as false positives. We identify 15 candidates, including two new ones. All have sizes from 0.3 to 1 $R_{\rm J}$, and all but two have periods from 2 to 10 yr. We report two main findings based on this sample. First, the planet occurrence rate for the above size and period ranges is $0.70^{+0.40}_{-0.20}$ planets per Sun-like star, with the frequency of cold Jupiters agreeing with that from radial velocity surveys. Planet occurrence rises with decreasing planet size, roughly describable as $dN/d\log R \propto R^{\alpha}$ with $\alpha = -1.6^{+1.0}_{-0.9}$, i.e., Neptune-sized planets are some four times more common than Jupiter-sized ones. Second, five out of our 15 candidates orbit stars with known transiting planets at shorter periods, including one with five inner planets. We interpret this high incidence rate to mean: (1) almost all our candidates should be genuine; (2) across a large orbital range (from $\sim 0.05$ to a few astronomical units), mutual inclinations in these systems are at most a few degrees; and (3) large outer planets exist almost exclusively in systems with small inner planets. "
"The trapezoidal rule, which is a special case of the Newmark family of algorithms, is one of the most widely used methods for transient hyperbolic problems. In this work, we show that this rule conserves linear and angular momenta and energy in the case of undamped linear elastodynamics problems, and an `energy-like measure' in the case of undamped acoustic problems. These conservation properties, thus, provide a rational basis for using this algorithm. In linear elastodynamics problems, variants of the trapezoidal rule that incorporate `high-frequency' dissipation are often used, since the higher frequencies, which are not approximated properly by the standard displacement-based approach, often result in unphysical behavior. Instead of modifying the trapezoidal algorithm, we propose using a hybrid finite element framework for constructing the stiffness matrix. Hybrid finite elements, which are based on a two-field variational formulation involving displacement and stresses, are known to approximate the eigenvalues much more accurately than the standard displacement-based approach, thereby either bypassing or reducing the need for high-frequency dissipation. We show this by means of several examples, where we compare the numerical solutions obtained using the displacement-based and hybrid approaches against analytical solutions. "
"We study the phenomenology of a keV sterile neutrino in a supersymmetric model with $U(1)_R-$ lepton number in the light of a very recent observation of an X-ray line signal at around 3.5 keV, detected in the X-ray spectra of Andromeda galaxy and various galaxy clusters including the Perseus galaxy cluster. This model not only provides a small tree level mass to one of the active neutrinos but also renders a suitable warm dark matter candidate in the form of a sterile neutrino with negligible active-sterile mixing. Light neutrino masses and mixing can be explained once one-loop radiative corrections are taken into account. The scalar sector of this model can accommodate a Higgs boson with a mass of $\sim$ 125 GeV. In this model gravitino is the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP) and we also study the cosmological implications of this light gravitino with mass $\sim \mathcal O$(GeV). "

"There are several issues to do with dwarf galaxy predictions in the standard $\Lambda$CDM cosmology that have suscitated much recent debate about the possible modification of the nature of dark matter as providing a solution. We explore a novel solution involving ultra-light axions that can potentially resolve the missing satellites problem, the cusp-core problem, and the `too big to fail' problem. We discuss approximations to non-linear structure formation in dark matter models containing a component of ultra-light axions across four orders of magnitude in mass, $10^{-24}\text{ eV}\lesssim m_a \lesssim 10^{-20}\text{ eV}$, a range too heavy to be well constrained by linear cosmological probes such as the CMB and matter power spectrum, and too light/non-interacting for other astrophysical or terrestrial axion searches. We find that an axion of mass $m_a\approx 10^{-21}\text{ eV}$ contributing approximately $85\%$ of the total dark matter can introduce a significant kpc scale core in a typical Milky Way satellite galaxy in sharp contrast to a thermal relic with a transfer function cut off at the same scale, while still allowing such galaxies to form in significant number. Therefore ultra-light axions do not suffer from the \emph{Catch 22} that applies to using a warm dark matter as a solution to the small scale problems of cold dark matter. Our model simultaneously allows formation of enough high redshift galaxies to allow reconciliation with observational constraints, and also reduces the maximum circular velocities of massive dwarfs so that baryonic feedback may more plausibly resolve the predicted overproduction of massive MWG dwarf satellites. "
"We perform a comparative theoretical study of the data at spacelike momentum transfer for the $\gamma^*\gamma\to\pi^0$ transition form factor, just reported by the Belle Collaboration, vs. those published before by BaBar, also including the older CLEO and CELLO data. Various implications for the structure of the $\pi^0$ distribution amplitude vis-\`a-vis those data are discussed and the existing theoretical predictions are classified into three distinct categories. We argue that the actual bifurcation of the data with antithetic trends is artificial and reason that the Belle data are the better option. "
"We present a new study of the effects of quasar obscuration on the statistics of Damped Ly alpha (DLA) systems. We show that the extinction of any Galactic or extragalactic HI region increases with the column density of zinc with a turning point above which background sources are suddenly obscured. We derive a relation between the extinction of a DLA system and its HI column density, N, metallicity, Z, fraction of iron in dust, f_Fe(Z), and redshift, z. From this relation we estimate the fraction of DLA systems missed as a consequence of their own extinction in magnitude-limited surveys. We derive a method for recovering the true frequency distributions of N and Z in DLAs, f_N and f_Z, using the biased distributions measured in the redshift range where the observations have sufficient statistics (1.8 </= z </= 3). By applying our method we find that the well-known empirical thresholds of DLA column densities, N(ZnII) </~ 10^13.1 cm^-2 and N(HI) </~ 10^22 cm^-2 can be successfully explained in terms of the obscuration effect without tuning of the local dust parameters. The obscuration has a modest effect on the distribution of quasar apparent magnitudes, but plays an important role in shaping the statistical distributions of DLAs. The exact estimate of the bias is still limited by the paucity of the data (~40 zinc measurements at 1.8 </~ z </~ 3). We find that the fraction of DLAs missed as a consequence of obscuration is \~30% to 50%, consistent with the results of surveys of radio-selected quasars. By modelling the metallicity distribution with a Schechter function we find that the mean metallicity can be ~5 to 6 times higher than the value commonly reported for DLAs at z~2.3. "

"Talk is given at the YITP International Workshop -- `Recent Developments in QCD and Hadron Physics'. Recent CDF data of the inclusive jet cross section shows anomalous deviation around large transverse momentum $p_{T}(j)\approx 200 \sim 350$ GeV. Is it possible to interpret the anomaly in terms of virtual SUSY effects. The answer is `NO', because we find that the virtual SUSY loop interference effects are too small to explain the CDF data. "
"Spectroscopy of planetary nebulae (PNe) provides the means to investigate s-process enrichments of neutron(n)-capture elements that cannot be detected in asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars. However, accurate abundance determinations of these elements present a challenge. Corrections for unobserved ions can be large and uncertain, since in many PNe only one ion of a given n-capture element has been detected. Furthermore, the atomic data governing the ionization balance of these species are not well-determined, inhibiting the derivation of accurate ionization corrections. We present initial results of a program that addresses these challenges. Deep high resolution optical spectroscopy of ~20 PNe has been performed to detect emission lines from trans-iron species including Se, Br, Kr, Rb, and Xe. The optical spectral region provides access to multiple ions of these elements, which reduces the magnitude and importance of uncertainties in the ionization corrections. In addition, experimental and theoretical efforts are providing determinations of the photoionization cross-sections and recombination rate coefficients of Se, Kr, and Xe ions. These new atomic data will make it possible to derive robust ionization corrections for these elements. Together, our observational and atomic data results will enable n-capture element abundances to be determined with unprecedented accuracy in ionized nebulae. "
"We propose a nonparametric statistical test for goodness-of-fit: given a set of samples, the test determines how likely it is that these were generated from a target density function. The measure of goodness-of-fit is a divergence constructed via Stein's method using functions from a Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space. Our test statistic is based on an empirical estimate of this divergence, taking the form of a V-statistic in terms of the log gradients of the target density and the kernel. We derive a statistical test, both for i.i.d. and non-i.i.d. samples, where we estimate the null distribution quantiles using a wild bootstrap procedure. We apply our test to quantifying convergence of approximate Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods, statistical model criticism, and evaluating quality of fit vs model complexity in nonparametric density estimation.

"Let $\mathsf{PreOrd}(\mathbb C)$ be the category of internal preorders in an exact category $\mathbb C$. We show that the pair $(\mathsf{Eq}(\mathbb C), \mathsf{ParOrd}(\mathbb C))$ is a pretorsion theory in $\mathsf{PreOrd}(\mathbb C)$, where $\mathsf{Eq}(\mathbb C)$ and $\mathsf{ParOrd}(\mathbb C)$) are the full subcategories of internal equivalence relations and of internal partial orders in $\mathbb C$, respectively. We observe that $\mathsf{ParOrd}(\mathbb C)$ is a reflective subcategory of $\mathsf{PreOrd}(\mathbb C)$ such that each component of the unit of the adjunction is a pullback-stable regular epimorphism. The reflector $F:\mathsf{PreOrd}(\mathbb C)\to \mathsf{ParOrd}(\mathbb C)$ turns out to have stable units in the sense of Cassidy, H\'ebert and Kelly, thus inducing an admissible categorical Galois structure. In particular, when $\mathbb C$ is the category $\mathsf{Set}$ of sets, we show that this reflection induces a monotone-light factorization system (in the sense of Carboni, Janelidze, Kelly and Par\'e) in $\mathsf{PreOrd}(\mathsf{Set})$. A topological interpretation of our results in the category of Alexandroff-discrete spaces is also given, via the well-known isomorphism between this latter category and $\mathsf{PreOrd}(\mathsf{Set})$.

"An aperiodic and irreducible Markov chain on a finite state space converges to its stationary distribution. When convergence to equilibrium is measured by total variation distance, there exists an optimal coupling and a maximal coupling time. In this article, the maximal coupling time is compared to the hitting time of a specific state or set. Such sets, named halting sets, are studied in the case of symmetric birth-and-death chains and in some other examples. Some applications to the cutoff phenomenon are given. These results yield new methods to calculate cutoff times for some monotone birth-and death chains without the lazy hypothesis . "
"Rubble piles are a common feature of solar system bodies. They are composed of monolithic elements of ice or rock bound by gravity. Voids occupy a significant fraction of the volume of a rubble pile. They can exist up to pressure $P\approx \epsy\mu$, where $\epsy$ is the monolithic material's yield strain and $\mu$ its rigidity. At low $P$, contacts between neighboring elements are confined to a small fraction of their surface areas. As a result, the effective thermal conductivity of a rubble pile, $\kcon\approx k(P/(\epsy\mu))^{1/2}$, can be orders of magnitude smaller than, $k$, the thermal conductivity of its monolithic elements. In a fluid-free environment, only radiation can transfer energy across voids. It contributes an additional component, $\krad=16\ell\sigma T^3/3$, to the total effective conductivity, $\keff=\kcon +\krad$. Here $\ell$, the inverse of the opacity per unit volume, is of order the size of the elements and voids. An important distinction between $\kcon$ and $\krad$ is that the former is independent of the size of the elements whereas the latter is proportional to it. Our expression for $\keff$ provides a good fit to the depth dependence of thermal conductivity in the top $140\,\mathrm{cm}$ of the lunar regolith. It also offers a good starting point for detailed modeling of thermal inertias for asteroids and satellites. Measurement of the response of surface temperature to variable insolation is a valuable diagnostic of a regolith. There is an opportunity for careful experiments under controlled laboratory conditions to test models of thermal conductivity such as the one we outline. "
"Assuming that the actual values of the top quark mass at FNAL and of the ratio of partial widths Z->bb/Z->hadrons at LEP are within their current one-sigma reported ranges, we present a No-Lose Theorem for superpartner searches at LEP II and an upgraded Tevatron. We impose only two theoretical assumptions: the Lagrangian is that of the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model with arbitrary soft-breaking terms, and all couplings remain perturbative up to scales of order 10^16 GeV; there are no assumptions about the soft SUSY breaking parameters, proton decay, cosmology, etc. In particular, if the LEP and FNAL values hold up and supersymmetry is responsible for the discrepancy with the SM prediction of the partial width of Z->bb, then we must have charginos and/or top squarks observable at the upgraded machines. Furthermore, little deviation from the SM is predicted within ""super-unified"" SUSY. Finally, it appears to be extremely difficult to find any unified MSSM model, regardless of the form of soft SUSY breaking, that can explain the partial width for large tan(beta); in particular, no model with top-bottom-tau Yukawa coupling unification appears to be consistent with the experiments. "
"In our work on the development of model-independent data analysis methods for determining ratios between different couplings/cross sections of Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMPs) by using measured recoil energies from direct Dark Matter detection experiments directly, it was assumed that the analyzed data sets are background-free, i.e., all events are WIMP signals. In this article, as a more realistic study, we take into account a fraction of possible residue background events, which pass all discrimination criteria and then mix with other real WIMP-induced events in our data sets. Our simulations show that, assuming that the spin-dependent (SD) WIMP-nucleus interaction dominates over the spin-independent (SI) one, the maximal acceptable fraction of residue background events in the analyzed data sets for determining the ratio of the SD WIMP coupling on neutrons to that on protons is ~ 20% - 40%; whereas considering a general combination of the SI and SD WIMP interactions, the maximal acceptable background ratio for determining the ratio between two SD WIMP couplings as well as the ratios of the SD cross section on protons (neutrons) to the SI one is ~ 10% - 20%. Moreover, by considering different forms of background spectrum, we find that only background events in the lowest energy ranges could affect the reconstructions (significantly); those in high energy ranges would almost not change the reconstructed ratios or only very slightly. "
"We present an FPGA-based online data reduction system for the pixel detector of the future Belle II experiment. The occupancy of the pixel detector is estimated at 3 %. This corresponds to a data output rate of more than 20 GB/s after zero suppression, dominated by background. The Online Selection Nodes (ONSEN) system aims to reduce the background data by a factor of 30. It consists of 33 MicroTCA cards, each equipped with a Xilinx Virtex-5 FPGA and 4 GiB DDR2 RAM. These cards are hosted by 9 AdvancedTCA carrier boards. The ONSEN system buffers the entire output data from the pixel detector for up to 5 seconds. During this time, the Belle II high-level trigger PC farm performs an online event reconstruction, using data from the other Belle II subdetectors. It extrapolates reconstructed tracks to the layers of the pixel detector and defines regions of interest around the intercepts. Based on this information, the ONSEN system discards all pixels not inside a region of interest before sending the remaining hits to the event builder system. During a beam test with one layer of the pixel detector and four layers of the surrounding silicon strip detector, including a scaled-down version of the high-level trigger and data acquisition system, the pixel data reduction using regions of interest was exercised. We investigated the data produced in more than 20 million events and verified that the ONSEN system behaved correctly, forwarding all pixels inside regions of interest and discarding the rest. "
We show that a direct limit of surjections of (weak) Golod--Shafarevich algebras is a weak Golod--Shafarevich algebra as well. This holds both for graded and for filtered algebras provided that the filtrations are induced by the filtration of the first entry of the sequence. It follows that the limit is an algebra of exponential growth. An example shows that the assumptions of this theorem cannot be directly weakened.
"We report a Raman spectroscopy study of graphene field-effect transistors (GFET) with a controlled amount of defects introduced in graphene by exposure to electron-beam irradiation. Raman spectra are taken at T = 8 K over a range of back gate voltages (Vg) for various irradiation dosages (Re). We study effects in the Raman spectra due to Vg-induced doping and artificially created disorder at various Re. With moderate disorder (irradiation), the Raman G peak with respect to the graphene carrier density (nFE) exhibits a minimum in peak frequency and a maximum in peak width near the charge- neutral point (CNP). These trends are similar to those seen in previous works on pristine graphene and have been attributed to a reduction of electron-phonon coupling strength (D) and removal of the Kohn anomaly as the Fermi level moves away from the CNP. We also observe a maximum in I2D/IG and weak maximum in ID/IG near the CNP. All the observed dependences of Raman parameters on nFE weaken at stronger disorder (higher Re), implying that disorder causes a reduction of D as well. Our findings are valuable for understanding Raman spectra and electron-phonon physics in doped and disordered graphene. "
"In this paper, we study instances of complex neural networks, i.e. neural netwo rks with complex topologies. We use Self-Organizing Map neural networks whose n eighbourhood relationships are defined by a complex network, to classify handwr itten digits. We show that topology has a small impact on performance and robus tness to neuron failures, at least at long learning times. Performance may howe ver be increased (by almost 10%) by artificial evolution of the network topo logy. In our experimental conditions, the evolved networks are more random than their parents, but display a more heterogeneous degree distribution. "
"The theory of continued fractions has been generalized to l-adic numbers by several authors and presents many differences with respect to the real case. In the present paper we investigate the expansion of rationals and quadratic irrationals for the l-adic continued fractions introduced by Ruban. In this case, rational numbers may have a periodic non-terminating continued fraction expansion, moreover, for quadratic irrational numbers, no analogue of Lagrange's theorem holds. We give general explicit criteria to establish the periodicity of the expansion in both the rational and the quadratic case (for rationals, the qualitative result is due to Laohakosol). "
"In the recent years, WiFi standard has been used to develop different kind of wireless networks due to its flexibility and the availability of cheap off the shelf hardware. Even if the standard itself lacks mobility support, it has been used in networks with mobile nodes. When mobility is involved, a fast handoff is of paramount importance, especially with multimedia applications. The current IEEE 802.11 standard does not provide any specification about how the handoff should take place. In this paper we propose a handoff scheme optimized for networks providing wireless connection to mass transit vehicles. The structure of the procedure is redesigned to minimize delay as well as assure reliability. A reliable handoff triggering mechanism is also designed exploiting the results obtained from a set of preliminary outdoor experiments. The proposed scheme was implemented and deployed in an experimental testbed, and several indoor tests were run in order to demonstrate its reliability and efficiency. "
It is shown that spatially homogeneous solutions of the Einstein equations coupled to a nonlinear scalar field and other matter exhibit accelerated expansion at late times for a wide variety of potentials $V$. These potentials are strictly positive but tend to zero at infinity. They satisfy restrictions on $V'/V$ and $V''/V'$ related to the slow-roll approximation. These results generalize Wald's theorem for spacetimes with positive cosmological constant to those with accelerated expansion driven by potentials belonging to a large class.
"We present the results of systematic experimental investigations and micromagnetic simulations for the ferromagnetic resonance in rectangular permalloy microstripes. It is shown that the resonant magnetization oscillations have a complex spatial structure including a quasi-homogeneous precession, lateral spin-wave resonances and localized edge modes, which strongly depend on sample orientation in an external magnetic field.

"ATLAS (Australia Telescope Large Area Survey) is a wide deep radio survey which is distinguished by its comprehensive multi-wavelength approach. ATLAS is creating a large dataset of radio-selected galaxies for studying the evolution and inter-relationship of star-forming and active galaxies. Although the project is far from complete, we are already starting to answer some of these questions, and have stumbled across three surprises along the way: * FRI/FRII radio-loud AGN embedded within spiral galaxies, * radio-bright AGN which are unexpectedly faint in the infrared, and which may be at high redshift * IR-luminous radio-quiet AGN which are partly responsible for the wide variations in reported values of the radio-infrared ratio These and other observations suggest that the AGN activity and star formation become increasingly inter-dependent at high redshifts.

"In the singularity and differential topological theory of Morse functions and higher dimensional versions or fold maps and application to algebraic and differential topology of manifolds, constructing explicit fold maps and investigating their source manifolds is fundamental, important and difficult. The author has introduced surgery operations (bubbling operations) to fold maps, motivated by studies of Kobayashi, Saeki etc. since 1990 and has explicitly shown that homology groups of Reeb spaces of maps constructed by iterations of these operations are flexible in several cases. Such operations seem to be strong tools in construction of maps and precise studies of manifolds. More precisely, the author has also noticed that the resulting groups are represented as direct sums of the original homology groups and suitable finitely generated commutative groups. The Reeb space of a map is the space of all connected components of inverse images of the maps. Reeb spaces inherit fundamental invariants of the manifolds such as homology groups etc. much in simple cases as polyhedra whose dimensions are equal to those of the target spaces. This paper is on a new explicit study of changes of homology groups of Reeb spaces of fold maps by the surgery operations. We present explicit changes obtained by an approach via elementary theory of sequences of numbers and fundamental continuous or differentiable functions. "
"Since the discovery of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) in 1965, characterization of the CMB anisotropy angular power spectrum has become somewhat of a holy grail for experimental cosmology. Because CMB anisotropy measurements are difficult, the full potential of the CMB is only now being realized. Improvements in experimental techniques and detector technology have yielded an explosion of progress in the past couple of years resulting in the ability to use measurements of the CMB to place meaningful constraints on cosmological parameters. In this review, I discuss the theory behind the CMB but focus primarily on the experiments, reviewing briefly the history of CMB anisotropy measurements and focusing on the recent experiments that have revolutionized this field. Results from these modern experiments are reviewed and the cosmological implications discussed. I conclude with brief comments about the future of CMB physics. "
"Reflection statistics have not been well studied for optical random media whose mean refractive indices do not match with the refractive indices of their surrounding media. Here, we theoretically study how this refractive index mismatch between a one dimensional (1D) optical sample and its surrounding medium affects the reflection statistics in the weak disorder limit, when the fluctuation part of the refractive index (dn) is much smaller than the mismatch as well as the mean refractive index of the sample (dn << <n>). In the theoretical derivation, we perform a detailed calculation that results in the analytical forms of mean and standard deviation (STD) of the reflectance in terms of disorder parameters (dn and lc) in an index mismatched backscattering system. Particularly, the orders of disorder parameters in STD of the reflectance for index mismatched systems is shown to be lower ( (<dn^2> lc )^1/2 ) than that of the matched systems (<dn^2> lc). By comparing STDs of the reflection coefficient of index matched and mismatched systems, we show that reflectance at the sample boundaries in index mismatched systems can enhance the signal of the STD to the disorder parameters of the reflectance. In terms of biophotonics applications, this result can lead to potential techniques that effectively extract the sample disorder parameters by manipulating the index mismatch conditions. Potential applications of the technique for enhancement in sensitivity of cancer detection at single cell level are also discussed. "
"Motivated by the recent experiment by Grayson et.al., we investigate a non-ohmic current-voltage characteristics for the tunneling into fractional quantum Hall liquids. We give a possible explanation for the experiment in terms of the chiral Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid theory. We study the interaction between the charge and neutral modes, and found that the leading order correction to the exponent $\alpha$ $(I\sim V^\alpha)$ is of the order of $\sqrt{\epsilon}$ $(\epsilon=v_n/v_c)$, which reduces the exponent $\alpha$. We suggest that it could explain the systematic discrepancy between the observed exponents and the exact $\alpha =1/\nu$ dependence. "
"Recent cosmological hydrodynamical simulations suggest that integral field spectroscopy can connect the high-order stellar kinematic moments h3 (~skewness) and h4 (~kurtosis) in galaxies to their cosmological assembly history. Here, we assess these results by measuring the stellar kinematics on a sample of 315 galaxies, without a morphological selection, using 2D integral field data from the SAMI Galaxy Survey. A proxy for the spin parameter ($\lambda_{R_e}$) and ellipticity ($\epsilon_e$) are used to separate fast and slow rotators; there exists a good correspondence to regular and non-regular rotators, respectively, as also seen in earlier studies. We confirm that regular rotators show a strong h3 versus $V/\sigma$ anti-correlation, whereas quasi-regular and non-regular rotators show a more vertical relation in h3 and $V/\sigma$. Motivated by recent cosmological simulations, we develop an alternative approach to kinematically classify galaxies from their individual h3 versus $V/\sigma$ signatures. We identify five classes of high-order stellar kinematic signatures using Gaussian mixture models. Class 1 corresponds to slow rotators, whereas Classes 2-5 correspond to fast rotators. We find that galaxies with similar $\lambda_{R_e}-\epsilon_e$ values can show distinctly different h3-$V/\sigma$ signatures. Class 5 objects are previously unidentified fast rotators that show a weak h3 versus $V/\sigma$ anti-correlation. These objects are predicted to be disk-less galaxies formed by gas-poor mergers. From morphological examination, however, there is evidence for large stellar disks. Instead, Class 5 objects are more likely disturbed galaxies, have counter-rotating bulges, or bars in edge-on galaxies. Finally, we interpret the strong anti-correlation in h3 versus $V/\sigma$ as evidence for disks in most fast rotators, suggesting a dearth of gas-poor mergers among fast rotators. "
"Considering the sets of subsums of series (or achievement sets) we show that for conditionally convergent series the multidimensional case is much more complicated than that of the real line. Although we are far from the full topological classification of such sets, we present many surprising examples and catch the ideas standing behind them in general theorems. "
"Each topological group $G$ admits a unique universal minimal dynamical system $(M(G),G)$. When $G$ is a non-compact locally compact group the phase space $M(G)$ of this universal system is non-metrizable. There are however topological groups for which $M(G)$ is the trivial one point system (extremely amenable groups), as well as topological groups $G$ for which $M(G)$ is a metrizable space and for which there is an explicit description of the dynamical system $(M(G),G)$. One such group is the topological group $S_\infty$ of all permutations of the integers ${\mathbb Z}$, with the topology of pointwise convergence. We show that $(M(S_\infty),S_\infty)$ is a symbolic dynamical system (hence in particular $M(S_\infty)$ is a Cantor set), and give a full description of all its symbolic factors. Among other facts we show that $(M(G),G)$ (and hence also every minimal $S_\infty$) has the structure of a two-to-one group extension of proximal system and that it is uniquely ergodic. "
"Over the years many He-He interaction potentials have been developed, some very sophisticated, including various corrections beyond Born-Oppenheimer approximation. Most of them were used to predict properties of helium dimers and trimers, examples of exotic quantum states, whose experimental study proved to be very challenging. Recently, detailed structural properties of helium trimers were measured for the first time, allowing a comparison with theoretical predictions and possibly enabling the evaluation of different interaction potentials. The comparisons already made included adjusting the maxima of both theoretical and experimental correlation functions to one, so the overall agreement between theory and experiment appeared satisfactory. However, no attempt was made to evaluate the quality of the interaction potentials used in the calculations. In this work, we calculate the experimentally measured correlation functions using both new and old potentials, compare them with experimental data and rank the potentials. We use diffusion Monte Carlo simulations at $T=0\ \mathrm{K}$, which give within statistical noise exact results of the ground state properties. All models predict both trimers $^4\mathrm{He}_{3}$ and $^4\mathrm{He}_2{}^3\mathrm{He}$ to be in a quantum halo state. "
"Consider the following Markov chain on permutations of length $n$. At each time step we choose a random position. If the letter at that position is smaller than the letter immediately to the left (cyclically) then these letters swap positions. Otherwise nothing happens, corresponding to a loop in the Markov chain. This is the circular TASEP. We compute the average proportion of time the chain spends at the identity permutation (and, in greater generality, at sorted words). This answers a conjecture by Thomas Lam. "
"Open-ended evolutionary dynamics remains an elusive goal for artificial evolutionary systems. Many ideas exist in the biological literature beyond the basic Darwinian requirements of variation, differential reproduction and inheritance. I argue that these ideas can be seen as aspects of five fundamental requirements for open-ended evolution: (1) robustly reproductive individuals, (2) a medium allowing the possible existence of a practically unlimited diversity of individuals and interactions, (3) individuals capable of producing more complex offspring, (4) mutational pathways to other viable individuals, and (5) drive for continued evolution. I briefly discuss implications of this view for the design of artificial systems with greater evolutionary potential. "
"We investigate the NBI matrix model with the potential $X\Lambda+X^{-1}+(2\eta+1)\log X$ recently proposed to describe IIB superstrings. With the proper normalization, using Virasoro constraints, we prove the equivalence of this model and the Kontsevich matrix model for $\eta\ne0$ and find the explicit transformation between the two models.

"The journey of the Sun through space carries the solar system through a dynamic interstellar environment that is presently characterized by Mach 1 motion between the heliosphere and the surrounding interstellar medium (ISM). The interaction between the heliosphere and ISM is an evolving process due to the variable solar wind and to interstellar turbulence. Frisch et al. presented a meta-analysis of the historical data on the interstellar wind flowing through the heliosphere and concluded that temporal changes in the ecliptic longitude of the wind were statistically indicated by the data available in the refereed literature at the time of that writing. Lallement and Bertaux disagree with this result, and suggested, for instance, that a key instrumental response function of IBEX-Lo was incorrect and that the STEREO pickup ion data are unsuitable for diagnosing the flow of interstellar neutrals through the heliosphere. Here we show that temporal variations in the interstellar wind through the heliosphere are consistent with our knowledge of local ISM. The statistical analysis of the historical helium wind data is revisited, and a recent correction of a typographical error in the literature is incorporated into the new fits. With this correction, and including no newer IBEX results, these combined data still indicate that a change in the longitude of the interstellar neutral wind over the past forty years is statistically likely, but that a constant flow longitude is now also statistically possible. It is shown that the IBEX instrumental response function is known, and that the STEREO pickup ion data have been correctly utilized in this analysis. "
"Ladder tournaments are widely used to rank individuals in real-world organizations and games. Their mathematical properties however are still poorly understood. We formalize the ranking rule generated by a ladder tournament, and we show that it is neither complete nor transitive in general. If it is complete, then it is transitive and its asymmetric component is a finite union of transitive tournaments. We also study the relationship between an individual's rank and his performance as measured by the frequency at which he is pivotal. We show an individual's pivotability is a weakly increasing function of his rank. "
"Game semantics describe the interactive behavior of proofs by interpreting formulas as games on which proofs induce strategies. Such a semantics is introduced here for capturing dependencies induced by quantifications in first-order propositional logic. One of the main difficulties that has to be faced during the elaboration of this kind of semantics is to characterize definable strategies, that is strategies which actually behave like a proof. This is usually done by restricting the model to strategies satisfying subtle combinatorial conditions, whose preservation under composition is often difficult to show. Here, we present an original methodology to achieve this task, which requires to combine advanced tools from game semantics, rewriting theory and categorical algebra. We introduce a diagrammatic presentation of the monoidal category of definable strategies of our model, by the means of generators and relations: those strategies can be generated from a finite set of atomic strategies and the equality between strategies admits a finite axiomatization, this equational structure corresponding to a polarized variation of the notion of bialgebra. This work thus bridges algebra and denotational semantics in order to reveal the structure of dependencies induced by first-order quantifiers, and lays the foundations for a mechanized analysis of causality in programming languages. "
"In this paper we will illustrate how to constrain unavoidable K\""ahler corrections for ${\cal N}=1$ supergravity (SUGRA) inflation from the recent Planck data. We will show that the non-renormalizable K\""ahler operators will induce in general non-minimal kinetic term for the inflaton field, and two types of SUGRA corrections in the potential - the Hubble-induced mass ($c_{H}$), and the Hubble-induced A-term ($a_{H}$) correction. The entire SUGRA inflationary framework can now be constrained from (i) the speed of sound, $c_s$, and (ii) from the upper bound on the tensor to scalar ratio, $r_{\star}$. We will illustrate this by considering a heavy scalar degree of freedom at a scale, $M_s$, and a light inflationary field which is responsible for a slow-roll inflation. We will compute the corrections to the kinetic term and the potential for the light field explicitly. As an example, we will consider a visible sector inflationary model of inflation where inflation occurs at the point of inflection, which can match the density perturbations for the cosmic microwave background radiation, and also explain why the universe is filled with the Standard Model degrees of freedom. We will scan the parameter space of the non-renormalizable K\""ahler operators, which we find them to be order ${\cal O}(1)$, consistent with physical arguments. While the scale of heavy physics is found to be bounded by the tensor-to scalar ratio, and the speed of sound, $ {\cal O}(10^{11}\leq M_s\leq 10^{16}) $GeV, for $0.02\leq c_s\leq 1$ and $10^{-22}\leq r_\star \leq 0.12$.

"Although representation learning methods developed within the framework of traditional neural networks are relatively mature, developing a spiking representation model remains a challenging problem. This paper proposes an event-based method to train a feedforward spiking neural network (SNN) layer for extracting visual features. The method introduces a novel spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) learning rule and a threshold adjustment rule both derived from a vector quantization-like objective function subject to a sparsity constraint. The STDP rule is obtained by the gradient of a vector quantization criterion that is converted to spike-based, spatio-temporally local update rules in a spiking network of leaky, integrate-and-fire (LIF) neurons. Independence and sparsity of the model are achieved by the threshold adjustment rule and by a softmax function implementing inhibition in the representation layer consisting of WTA-thresholded spiking neurons. Together, these mechanisms implement a form of spike-based, competitive learning. Two sets of experiments are performed on the MNIST and natural image datasets. The results demonstrate a sparse spiking visual representation model with low reconstruction loss comparable with state-of-the-art visual coding approaches, yet our rule is local in both time and space, thus biologically plausible and hardware friendly. "
"Network alignment aims at inferring a set of anchor links matching the shared entities between different information networks, which has become a prerequisite step for effective fusion of multiple information networks. In this paper, we will study the network alignment problem to fuse online social networks specifically. Social network alignment is extremely challenging to address due to several reasons, i.e., lack of training data, network heterogeneity and one-to-one constraint. Existing network alignment works usually require a large number of training data, but such a demand can hardly be met in applications, as manual anchor link labeling is extremely expensive. Significantly different from other homogeneous network alignment works, information in online social networks is usually of heterogeneous categories, the incorporation of which in model building is not an easy task. Furthermore, the one-to-one cardinality constraint on anchor links renders their inference process intertwistingly correlated. To resolve these three challenges, a novel network alignment model, namely ActiveIter, is introduced in this paper. ActiveIter defines a set of inter-network meta diagrams for anchor link feature extraction, adopts active learning for effective label query and uses greedy link selection for anchor link cardinality filtering. Extensive experiments are conducted on real-world aligned networks datasets, and the experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness of ActiveIter compared with other state-of-the-art baseline methods.

"In a multi-agent pathfinding (MAPF) problem, agents need to navigate from their start to their goal locations without colliding into each other. There are various MAPF algorithms, including Windowed Hierarchical Cooperative A*, Flow Annotated Replanning, and Bounded Multi-Agent A*. It is often the case that there is no a single algorithm that dominates all MAPF instances. Therefore, in this paper, we investigate the use of deep learning to automatically select the best MAPF algorithm from a portfolio of algorithms for a given MAPF problem instance. Empirical results show that our automatic algorithm selection approach, which uses an off-the-shelf convolutional neural network, is able to outperform any individual MAPF algorithm in our portfolio.

"\noindent The galaxy IRAS F10214+4724, discovered in a spectroscopic survey of a 0.2 Jy sample by Rowan-Robinson and collaborators in 1991, is significantly more luminous than any other known galaxy. Its bolometric luminosity is comparable to those of the most luminous quasars. Recent obsservations have revealed a candidate foreground group of galaxies, which might gravitationally lens F10214+4724, thus explaining much of its luminosity. High-resolution imaging of F10214+4724 has revealed that most of its near-IR flux comes from a circularly symmetric arc; this also supports the gravitational lens interpretation. In such a scenario, F10214+4724 would be the high-redshift analogue of the ultraluminous IRAS galaxies observed locally. This work presents a simple statistical lensing model to investigate this possibility. "
"This work investigates new kinematic features of parallel manipulators. It is well known that parallel manipulators admit generally several direct kinematic solutions for a given set of input joint values. The aim of this paper is to characterize the uniqueness domains in the workspace of parallel manipulators, as well as their image in the joint space. The study focuses on the most usual case of parallel manipulators with only one inverse kinematic solution. The notion of aspect introduced for serial manipulators in [Borrel 86] is redefined for such parallel manipulators. Then, it is shown that it is possible to link several solutions to the forward kinematic problem without meeting a singularity, thus meaning that the aspects are not uniqueness domains. An additional set of surfaces, namely the characteristic surfaces, are characterized which divide the workspace into basic regions and yield new uniqueness domains. This study is illustrated all along the paper with a 3-RPR planar parallel manipulator. An octree model of spaces is used to compute the joint space, the workspace and all other newly defined sets. "
Let X be an arbitrary hyperbolic geodesic metric space and let G be a countable non-elementary weakly acylindrical group of isometries of X. We show that the second bounded cohomology group of G with real coefficients or with coefficients in the regular representation is infinite dimensional. The result holds for any subgroup of the mapping class group of a non-exceptional surface of finite type not containing a normal subgroup which virtually split as a direct product.
High-resolution resonant inelastic x-ray scattering has been used to determine the momentum dependence of orbital excitations in Mott-insulating LaTiO$_3$ and YTiO$_3$ over a wide range of the Brillouin zone. The data are compared to calculations in the framework of lattice-driven and superexchange-driven orbital ordering models. A superexchange model in which the experimentally observed modes are attributed to two-orbiton excitations yields the best description of the data.
"We study several interesting examples of Biangular Tight Frames (BTFs) - basis-like sets of unit vectors admitting exactly two distinct frame angles (ie, pairwise absolute inner products) - and examine their relationships with Equiangular Tight Frames (ETFs) - basis-like systems which admit exactly one frame angle. We demonstrate a smooth parametrization BTFs, where the corresponding frame angles transform smoothly with the parameter, which ""passes through"" an ETF answers two questions regarding the rigidity of BTFs. We also develop a general framework of so-called harmonic BTFs and Steiner BTFs - which includes the equiangular cases, surprisingly, the development of this framework leads to a connection with the famous open problem(s) regarding the existence of Mersenne and Fermat primes. Finally, we construct a (chordally) biangular tight set of subspaces (ie, a tight fusion frame) which ""Pl\""ucker embeds"" into an ETF. "
"Hadoop is an open source implementation of the MapReduce Framework in the realm of distributed processing. A Hadoop cluster is a unique type of computational cluster designed for storing and analyzing large data sets across cluster of workstations. To handle massive scale data, Hadoop exploits the Hadoop Distributed File System termed as HDFS. The HDFS similar to most distributed file systems share a familiar problem on data sharing and availability among compute nodes, often which leads to decrease in performance. This paper is an experimental evaluation of Hadoop's computing performance which is made by designing a rack aware cluster that utilizes the Hadoop's default block placement policy to improve data availability. Additionally, an adaptive data replication scheme that relies on access count prediction using Langrange's interpolation is adapted to fit the scenario. To prove, experiments were conducted on a rack aware cluster setup which significantly reduced the task completion time, but once the volume of the data being processed increases there is a considerable cutback in computational speeds due to update cost. Further the threshold level for balance between the update cost and replication factor is identified and presented graphically. "

The non-crossing rule for the energy levels of a parameter-dependent Hamiltonian is revisited and a flaw in a commonly accepted proof is revealed. Some aspects of avoided crossings are illustrated by means of simple models. One of them shows the close relationship between avoided crossings and exceptional points.

"Hundreds of candidate hybrid pulsators of intermediate type A-F were revealed by the recent space missions. Hybrid pulsators allow to study the full stellar interiors, where p- and g-modes are simultaneously excited. The true hybrid stars must be identified since other processes, due to stellar multiplicity or rotation, might explain the presence of (some) low frequencies observed in their periodograms. We measured the radial velocities of 50 candidate Delta Sct - Gamma Dor hybrid stars from the Kepler mission with the Hermes/Ace spectrographs over a span of months to years. We aim to derive the fraction of binary and multiple systems and to provide an independent and homogeneous determination of the atmospheric properties and vsini for all targets. The objective is to identify the physical cause of the low frequencies. We computed 1-D cross-correlation functions (CCFs) in order to find the best parameters in terms of the number of components, spectral type and vsini for each target. Radial velocities were measured from spectrum synthesis and by using a 2-D cross-correlation technique in the case of double- and triple-lined systems. Fundamental parameters were determined by fitting (composite) synthetic spectra to the normalised median spectra corrected for the appropriate Doppler shifts. We report on the analysis of 478 high-resolution Hermes and 41 Ace spectra of A/F-type candidate hybrid pulsators from the Kepler field. We determined their radial velocities, projected rotational velocities, atmospheric properties and classified our targets based on the shape of the CCFs and the temporal behaviour of the radial velocities. We derived orbital solutions for seven new systems. Three long-period preliminary orbital solutions are confirmed by a photometric time-delay analysis. Finally, we determined a global multiplicity fraction of 27% in our sample of candidate hybrid stars. "
"Despite being studied for over a century, the use of quadrupoles have been limited to Cartesian coordinates in flat spacetime due to the incorrect transformation rules used to define them. Here the correct transformation rules are derived, which are particularly unusual as they involve second derivatives of the coordinate transformation and an integral. Transformations involving integrals have not been seen before. This is significantly different from the familiar transformation rules for a dipole, where the components transform as tensors. It enables quadrupoles to be correctly defined in general relativity and to prescribe the equations of motion for a quadrupole in a coordinate system adapted to its motion and then transform them to the laboratory coordinates. An example is given of another unusual feature: a quadrupole which is free of dipole terms in polar coordinates has dipole terms in Cartesian coordinates. It is shown that dipoles, electric dipoles, quadrupoles and electric quadrupoles can be defined without reference to a metric and in a coordinates free manner. This is particularly useful given their complicated coordinate transformation. "
"The exact critical Casimir force between periodically deformed boundaries of a 2D semi-infinite strip is obtained for conformally invariant classical systems. Only two parameters (conformal charge and scaling dimension of a boundary changing operator), along withthe solution of an electrostatic problem, determine the Casimir force, rendering the theory practically applicable to any shape and arrangement. The attraction between any two mirror symmetric objects follows directly from our general result. The possibility of purely shape induced reversal of the force, as well as occurrence of stable equilibrium points, is demonstrated for certain conformally invariant models, including the tricritical Ising model.

"It is anticipated that forthcoming, next generation, atmospheric Cherenkov telescope arrays will include a number of medium-sized telescopes that are constructed using a dual-mirror Schwarzschild-Couder configuration. These telescopes will sample a wide ($8^{\circ}$) field of view using a densely pixelated camera comprising over $10^{4}$ individual readout channels. A readout frequency congruent with the expected single-telescope trigger rates would result in substantial data rates. To ameliorate these data rates, a novel, hardware-level Distributed Intelligent Array Trigger (DIAT) is envisioned. A copy of the DIAT operates autonomously at each telescope and uses reduced resolution imaging data from a limited subset of nearby telescopes to veto events prior to camera readout {and any subsequent network transmission of camera data that is required for centralized storage or aggregation}. We present the results of Monte-Carlo simulations that evaluate the efficacy of a ""Parallax width"" discriminator that can be used by the DIAT to efficiently distinguish between genuine gamma-ray initiated events and unwanted background events that are initiated by hadronic cosmic rays.

We study condensation of open string tachyons using renormalization group flow in the worldsheet field theory. This approach leads to a simple picture of the physics of the nontrivial condensate.
"We develop a simplified light source at 461 nm for laser cooling of Sr without frequency-doubling crystals but with blue laser diodes. An anti-reflection coated blue laser diode in an external cavity (Littrow) configuration provides an output power of 40 mW at 461 nm. Another blue laser diode is used to amplify the laser power up to 110 mW by injection locking. For frequency stabilization, we demonstrate modulation-free polarization spectroscopy of Sr in a hollow cathode lamp. The simplification of the laser system achieved in this work is of great importance for the construction of transportable optical lattice clocks. "
"Given a Lebesgue integrable function $f$ over $[0,2\pi]$, we consider the sequence of matrices $\{Y_nT_n[f]\}_n$, where $T_n[f]$ is the $n$-by-$n$ Toeplitz matrix generated by $f$ and $Y_n$ is the flip permutation matrix, also called the anti-identity matrix. Because of the unitary character of $Y_n$, the singular values of $T_n[f]$ and $Y_n T_n[f]$ coincide. However, the eigenvalues are affected substantially by the action of the matrix $Y_n$. Under the assumption that the Fourier coefficients are real, we prove that $\{Y_nT_n[f]\}_n$ is distributed in the eigenvalue sense as \[ \phi_g(\theta)=\left\{ \begin{array}{cc} g(\theta), & \theta\in [0,2\pi], -g(-\theta), & \theta\in [-2\pi,0), \end{array} \right.\, \] with $g(\theta)=|f(\theta)|$. We also consider the preconditioning introduced by Pestana and Wathen and, by using the same arguments, we prove that the preconditioned sequence is distributed in the eigenvalue sense as $\phi_1$, under the mild assumption that $f$ is sparsely vanishing. We emphasize that the mathematical tools introduced in this setting have a general character and in fact can be potentially used in different contexts. A number of numerical experiments are provided and critically discussed. "
"Statistical theory of turbulence in viscid incompressible fluid, described by the Navier-Stokes equation driven by random force, is reformulated in terms of scale-dependent fields $\mathbf{u}_a(x)$, defined as wavelet-coefficients of the velocity field $\mathbf{u}$ taken at point $x$ with the resolution $a$. Applying quantum field theory approach of stochastic hydrodynamics to the generating functional of random fields $\mathbf{u}_a(x)$, we have shown the velocity field correlators $\langle \mathbf{u}_{a_1}(x_1)\ldots \mathbf{u}_{a_n}(x_n)\rangle$ to be finite by construction for the random stirring force acting at prescribed large scale $L$. The study is performed in $d=3$ dimension. Since there are no divergences, regularization is not required, and the renormalization group invariance becomes merely a symmetry that relates velocity fluctuations of different scales in terms of the Kolmogorov-Richardson picture of turbulence development. The integration over the scale arguments is performed from the external scale $L$ down to the observation scale $A$, which lies in Kolmogorov range $l \ll A \ll L$. Our oversimplified model is full dissipative: interaction between scales is provided only locally by the gradient vertex $(\mathbf{u}\nabla) \mathbf{u}$, neglecting any effects or parity violation that might be responsible for energy backscatter. The corrections to viscosity and the pair velocity correlator are calculated in one-loop approximation. This gives the dependence of turbulent viscosity on observation scale and describes the scale dependence of the velocity field correlations. "
"Current outdoor mobile network infrastructure cannot support uplink intensive mobile applications such as connected vehicles that collect and upload large amount of real time data. Our investigation reveals that with maximum-ratio (MR) decoding, it is theoretically impossible to support such applications with cell-free Massive MIMO, and it requires a very large number of service antennas in single cell configuration, making it practically infeasible; but with zero-forcing (ZF) decoding, such applications can be easily supported by cell-free Massive MIMO with very moderate number of access points (AP's), and it requires a lot more service antennas in single cell configuration. Via the newly derived SINR expressions for cell-free Massive MIMO with ZF decoding we show that uplink power control is unnecessary, and that with 10 MHz effective bandwidth for uplink data transmission, in urban and suburban morphologies, on the 2 GHz band, 90 single antenna AP's per square kilometer and 32 single antenna AP's per square kilometer are enough to support 18 autonomous vehicles respectively. In rural morphology, using 450 MHz band, only 2 single antenna AP's per square kilometer is enough. "
"Fully Differential Cross Sections (FDCS) for single electron capture from helium by heavy ion impact are calculated using a frozen core 3-Body model and an active electron 4-Body model within the first Born approximation. FDCS are presented for H+, He2+, Li3+, and C6+ projectiles with velocities of 100 keV/amu, 1 MeV/amu, and 10 MeV/amu. In general, the FDCS from the two models are found to differ by about one order of magnitude with the active electron 4-Body model showing better agreement with experiment. Comparison of the models reveals two possible sources of the magnitude difference: the inactive electron's change of state and the projectile-target Coulomb interaction used in the different models. Detailed analysis indicates that the uncaptured electron's change of state can safely be neglected in the frozen core approximation, but that care must be used in modeling the projectile-target interaction. "
"We calculate the NMR relaxation rate due to quadrupolar coupling of the nucleus to a local, strongly anharmonic phonon mode. As a model potential for a rattling motion we consider a square-well potential. We calculate the free phonon Green's function analytically and derive the low and high temperature limits of the NMR relaxation rate. It is shown that the temperature dependence of the NMR relaxation rate possesses a peak in contrast to harmonic phonons but in qualitative agreement with a recent NMR study on KOs2O6. We discuss the influence of phonon renormalization due to electron-phonon interaction. "
"Based on the standard many-fermion field theory, the authors construct models describing ultracold fermions in a 1D optical lattices by implementing a mode expansion of the fermionic field operator where modes, in addition to space localization, take into account the quantum numbers inherent in local fermion interactions. The resulting models are generalized Hubbard Hamiltonians whose interaction parameters are derived by a fully-analytical calculation. The special interest for this derivation resides in its model-generating capability and in the flexibility of the trapping techniques that allow the tuning of the Hamiltonian interaction parameters over a wide range of values. While the Hubbard Hamiltonian is recovered in a very low-density regime for a fermionic system, in general, far more complicated Hamiltonians characterise high-density regimes, revealing a rich scenario for both the phenomenology of interacting trapped fermions and the experimental realization of devices for quantum information processing. As a first example of the different situations that may arise beyond the models well known in the literature (the unpolarized-spin fermion model and the noninteracting spin-polarized fermion model), we derive a Rotational Hubbard Hamiltonian describing the local rotational activity of spin-polarized fermions. Based on a standard techniques we obtain the mean-field version of our model Hamiltonian and show how different dynamical algebras characterize the case of attractive and repulsive two-body potentials.

"To further improve the potential of full-duplex communications, networks may employ multiple antennas at the base station or user equipment. To this end, networks that employ current radios usually deal with self-interference and multi-user interference by beamforming techniques. Although previous works investigated beamforming design to improve spectral efficiency, the fundamental question of how to split the antennas at a base station between uplink and downlink in full-duplex networks has not been investigated rigorously. This paper addresses this question by posing antenna splitting as a binary nonlinear optimization problem to minimize the sum mean squared error of the received data symbols. It is shown that this is an NP-hard problem. This combinatorial problem is dealt with by equivalent formulations, iterative convex approximations, and a binary relaxation. The proposed algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a stationary solution of the relaxed problem with much smaller complexity than exhaustive search. Numerical results indicate that the proposed solution is close to the optimal in both high and low self-interference capable scenarios, while the usually assumed antenna splitting is far from optimal. For large number of antennas, a simple antenna splitting is close to the proposed solution. This reveals that the importance of antenna splitting is inversely proportional with the number of antennas. "
"We present the library Collier for the numerical evaluation of one-loop scalar and tensor integrals in perturbative relativistic quantum field theories. The code provides numerical results for arbitrary tensor and scalar integrals for scattering processes in general quantum field theories. For tensor integrals either the coefficients in a covariant decomposition or the tensor components themselves are provided. Collier supports complex masses, which are needed in calculations involving unstable particles. Ultraviolet and infrared singularities are treated in dimensional regularization. For soft and collinear singularities mass regularization is available as an alternative. "
"We generalize the notion of a graph automatic group introduced by Kharlampovich, Khoussainov and Miasnikov (arXiv:1107.3645) by replacing the regular languages in their definition with more powerful language classes. For a fixed language class $\mathcal C$, we call the resulting groups $\mathcal C$-graph automatic. We prove that the class of $\mathcal C$-graph automatic groups is closed under change of generating set, direct and free product for certain classes $\mathcal C$. We show that for quasi-realtime counter-graph automatic groups where normal forms have length that is linear in the geodesic length, there is an algorithm to compute normal forms (and therefore solve the word problem) in polynomial time. The class of quasi-realtime counter-graph automatic groups includes all Baumslag-Solitar groups, and the free group of countably infinite rank. Context-sensitive-graph automatic groups are shown to be a very large class, which encompasses, for example, groups with unsolvable conjugacy problem, the Grigorchuk group, and Thompson's groups $F,T$ and $V$.

"The femtocaching idea was proposed as a solution to compensate for the weak backhaul capacity, by deploying coverage-limited nodes with high storage capacity called femtocaches (FCs). In this paper, the macrocell offloading problem in femtocaching-assisted cellular networks is investigated. The objective is to minimize the number of transmissions by the macrocell base station (MBS) given that all requests should be served simultaneously to satisfy quality-of-experience (QoE) of the clients. We first formulate this MBS offloading problem as an optimization problem over a network coding graph, and show that it is NP-hard. Therefore, we propose an ONC-broadcast offloading scheme that exploits both broadcasting and opportunistic network coding (ONC) to minimize the number of required MBS transmissions. We utilize a random graph model to approximate the performance of the proposed ONC-broadcast scheme in terms of the resultant average number of transmissions by the MBS. Moreover, despite the complexity of finding the optimal solution for each and every case, we prove that this ONC-broadcast scheme is asymptotically optimal, i.e., for large number of requests, the ONC-broadcast scheme achieves a similar macrocell offloading performance to that of the optimal solution. To implement the ONC-broadcast scheme, we devise a heuristic that employs a dual conflict graph or broadcasting at the FCs such that the remaining requests can be served using the minimum number of transmissions at the MBS. Simulations show that the dual graph scheme improves MBS offloading as compared to the traditional separate graph scheme. Furthermore, the simple heuristic proposed to implement the ONC-broadcast scheme achieves a very close performance to the optimal ONC-broadcast scheme. "
The recent application of Fourier Based Iterative Reconstruction Method (FIRM) has made it possible to achieve high-quality 2D images from a fan beam Computed Tomography (CT) scan with a limited number of projections in a fast manner. The proposed methodology in this article is designed to provide 3D Radon space in linogram fashion to facilitate the use of FIRM with cone beam projections (CBP) for the reconstruction of 3D images in a low dose Cone Beam CT (CBCT).
"We use the current weak lensing data to constrain the equation of state of dark energy $w$ and the total mass of massive neutrinos $\sum m_{\nu}$. The constraint on $w$ would be weak if only the current weak lensing data are used. With the addition of other observational data such as the type Ia supernovae, baryon acoustic oscillation, and the high redshift Hubble parameter data $H(z)$ derived from relative galaxy ages to break the degeneracy, the result is significantly improved. For the pure $w$CDM model without massive neutrinos, we find $w=-1.00^{+0.10}_{-0.12}$. For the $w$CDM model with the massive neutrino component, we show that the constraint on $w$ is almost unchanged, there is very little degeneracy between $w$ and $\sum m_{\nu}$. After marginalizing over other parameters, we obtain the probability distribution function of $\sum m_{\nu}$, and find that the upper limit is $\sum m_{\nu} \leq 0.8$ eV at 95.5% confidence level for the combined data sets. Our constraints of $w$ and $\sum m_{\nu}$ are both compatible and comparable with the constraints obtained from the WMAP 5-year data. "
"Davis and Knuth in 1970 introduced the notion of revolving sequences, as representations of a Gaussian integer. Later, Mizutani and Ito pointed out a close relationship between a set of points determined by all revolving sequences and a self-similar set, which is called the Dragon, from the viewpoint of symbolic dynamical systems. We will show how their result can be generalized by a completely different approach. "
"We present a study on low-$T_c$ superconductor-insulator-ferromagnet-superconductor (SIFS) Josephson junctions. SIFS junctions have gained considerable interest in recent years because they show a number of interesting properties for future classical and quantum computing devices. We optimized the fabrication process of these junctions to achieve a homogeneous current transport, ending up with high-quality samples. Depending on the thickness of the ferromagnetic layer and on temperature, the SIFS junctions are in the ground state with a phase drop either 0 or $\pi$. By using a ferromagnetic layer with variable step-like thickness along the junction, we obtained a so-called 0-$\pi$ Josephson junction, in which 0 and $\pi$ ground states compete with each other. At a certain temperature the 0 and $\pi$ parts of the junction are perfectly symmetric, i.e. the absolute critical current densities are equal. In this case the degenerate ground state corresponds to a vortex of supercurrent circulating clock- or counterclockwise and creating a magnetic flux which carries a fraction of the magnetic flux quantum $\Phi_0$. "
"In this paper, we relate the framework of mod-$\phi$ convergence to the construction of approximation schemes for lattice-distributed random variables. The point of view taken here is that of Fourier analysis in the Wiener algebra, allowing the computation of asymptotic equivalents in the local, Kolmogorov and total variation distances. By using signed measures instead of probability measures, we are able to construct better approximations of discrete lattice distributions than the standard Poisson approximation. This theory applies to various examples arising from combinatorics and number theory: number of cycles in (possibly coloured) permutations, number of prime divisors (possibly within different residue classes) of a random integer, number of irreducible factors of a random polynomial, etc. One advantage of the approach developed in this paper is that it allows us to deal with approximations in higher dimensions as well. In this setting, we can explicitly see the influence of the correlations between the components of the random vectors in our asymptotic formulas. "
"This article studies some numerical approximations of the homogenized matrix for stochastic linear elliptic partial differential equations in divergence form. We focus on the case when the underlying random field is a small perturbation of a reference periodic tensor. The size of such a perturbation is encoded by a real parameter eta. In this case, it has already been theoretically shown in the literature that the exact homogenized matrix possesses an expansion in powers of the parameter eta for both models considered in this article, the coefficients of which are deterministic. In practice, one cannot manipulate the exact terms of such an expansion. All objects are subjected to a discretization approach. Thus we need to derive a similar expansion for the approximated random homogenized matrix. In contrast to the expansion of the exact homogenized matrix, the expansion of the approximated homogenized matrix contains intrinsically random coefficients. In particular, the second order term is random in nature. The purpose of this work is to derive and study this expansion in function of the parameters of the approximation procedure (size of the truncated computational domain used, meshsize of the finite elements approximation). "
"We study asymptotic distribution of eigen-values $\omega$ of a quadratic operator polynomial of the following form $(\omega^2-L(\omega))\phi_\omega=0$, where $L(\omega)$ is a second order differential positive elliptic operator with quadratic dependence on the spectral parameter $\omega$. We derive asymptotics of the spectral density in this problem and show how to compute coefficients of its asymptotic expansion from coefficients of the asymptotic expansion of the trace of the heat kernel of $L(\omega)$. The leading term in the spectral asymptotics is the same as for a Laplacian in a cavity. The results have a number of physical applications. We illustrate them by examples of field equations in external stationary gravitational and gauge backgrounds. "
"The physical fields (electromagnetic and electron fields) considered in the framework of Clifford algebras $\C_2$ and $\C_4$. The electron field described by the algebra $\C_4$ which in spinor representation is realized by well-known Dirac $\gamma$-matrices, and by force of isomorphism $\C_{4}\cong\C_{2}\otimes \C_{2}$ is represented as a tensor product of two photon fields. By means of this introduced a system of electron field equations, which in particular cases is coincide with Dirac's and Maxwell's equations. "
"Vortex element methods are often used to efficiently simulate incompressible flows using Lagrangian techniques. Use of the FMM (Fast Multipole Method) allows considerable speed up of both velocity evaluation and vorticity evolution terms in these methods. Both equations require field evaluation of constrained (divergence free) vector valued quantities (velocity, vorticity) and cross terms from these. These are usually evaluated by performing several FMM accelerated sums of scalar harmonic functions. We present a formulation of the vortex methods based on the Lamb-Helmholtz decomposition of the velocity in terms of two scalar potentials. In its original form, this decomposition is not invariant with respect to translation, violating a key requirement for the FMM. One of the key contributions of this paper is a theory for translation for this representation. The translation theory is developed by introducing ""conversion"" operators, which enable the representation to be restored in an arbitrary reference frame. Using this form, extremely efficient vortex element computations can be made, which need evaluation of just two scalar harmonic FMM sums for evaluating the velocity and vorticity evolution terms. Details of the decomposition, translation and conversion formulae, and sample numerical results are presented. "
"Ergodic and combinatorial results obtained in [10] involved measure preserving actions of the affine group ${\mathcal A}_K$ of a countable field $K$. In this paper we develop a new approach based on ultrafilter limits which allows one to refine and extend the results obtained in [10] to a more general situation involving the measure preserving actions of the non-amenable affine semigroups of a large class of integral domains. (The results in [10] heavily depend on the amenability of the affine group of a field). Among other things, we obtain, as a corollary of an ultrafilter ergodic theorem, the following result: Let $K$ be a number field and let ${\mathcal O}_K$ be the ring of integers of $K$. For any finite partition $K=C_1\cup\cdots\cup C_r$ there exists $i\in\{1,\dots,r\}$ and many $x\in K$ and $y\in{\mathcal O}_K$ such that $\{x+y,xy\}\subset C_i$. "
"Classical black hole analogues (alternatively, the analogue systems) are fluid dynamical analogue of general relativistic black holes. Such analogue effects may be observed when acoustic perturbations (sound waves) propagate through a classical dissipation-less tran-sonic fluid. The acoustic horizon, which resembles the actual black hole event horizon in many ways, may be generated at the transonic point in the fluid flow. Acoustic horizon emits quasi thermal phonon spectra, which is analogous to the actual Hawking radiation, and possesses the temperature referred as the analogue Hawking temperature, or simply, the analogue temperature. Transonic accretion onto astrophysical black holes is a very interesting example of classical analogue system found naturally in the Universe. An accreting black holes system as a classical analogue is unique in the sense that only for such a system, both kind of horizons, the electromagnetic and the acoustic (generated due to transonicity of accreting fluid) are simultaneously present in the same system. Hence an accreting astrophysical black hole is the ideal-most candidate to theoretically study and to compare the properties of these two different kind of horizons. Also such system is unique in the aspect that general relativistic spherical accretion onto the Schwarzschild black hole represents the only classical analogue system found in the nature so far, where the analogue Hawking temperature may be higher than the actual Hawking temperature.

"The analysis of over ten years of commercial development using Agile (10,100 unique task estimates made by 22 developers, under 20 project codes) is documented via a conversation involving the data analyst and a director of the company that created the SiP dataset. Factors found to influence task implementation effort estimation accuracy include the person making the estimate, the project involved, and the propensity to use round numbers. Any improvement in estimation accuracy, with practice, did not noticeably improve regression models fitted. "
"Analyses for $^{81}$Kr and noble gases on groundwater from the deepest aquifer system of the Baltic Artesian Basin (BAB) were performed to determine groundwater ages and uncover the flow dynamics of the system on a timescale of several hundred thousand years. We find that the system is controlled by mixing of three distinct water masses: Interglacial or recent meteoric water $(\delta^{18}\text{O} \approx -10.4\unicode{x2030})$ with a poorly evolved chemical and noble gas signature, glacial meltwater $(\delta^{18}\text{O} \leq -18\unicode{x2030})$ with elevated noble gas concentrations, and an old, high-salinity brine component $(\delta^{18}\text{O} \geq -4.5\unicode{x2030}, \geq 90 \text{g Cl}^{-}/\text{L})$ with strongly depleted atmospheric noble gas concentrations. The $^{81}$Kr measurements are interpreted within this mixing framework to estimate the age of the end-members. Deconvoluted $^{81}$Kr ages range from 300 ka to 1.3 Ma for interglacial or recent meteoric water and glacial meltwater. For the brine component, ages exceed the dating range of the ATTA 3 instrument of 1.3 Ma. The radiogenic noble gas components $^{4}$He* and $^{40}$Ar* are less conclusive but also support an age of > 1 Ma for the brine. Based on the chemical and noble gas concentrations and the dating results, we conclude that the brine originates from evaporated seawater that has been modified by later water-rock interaction. As the obtained tracer ages cover several glacial cycles, we discuss the impact of the glacial cycles on flow patterns in the studied aquifer system. "
"The formal verification and controller synthesis for Markov decision processes that evolve over uncountable state spaces are computationally hard and thus generally rely on the use of approximations. In this work, we consider the correct-by-design control of general Markov decision processes (gMDPs) with respect to temporal logic properties by leveraging approximate probabilistic relations between the original model and its abstraction. We newly work with a robust satisfaction for the construction and verification of control strategies, which allows for both deviations in the outputs of the gMDPs and in the probabilistic transitions. The computation is done over the reduced or abstracted models, such that when a property is robustly satisfied on the abstract model, it is also satisfied on the original model with respect to a refined control strategy. "
"Technology trends will cause data movement to account for the majority of energy expenditure and execution time on emerging computers. Therefore, computational complexity will no longer be a sufficient metric for comparing algorithms, and a fundamental characterization of data access complexity will be increasingly important. The problem of developing lower bounds for data access complexity has been modeled using the formalism of Hong & Kung's red/blue pebble game for computational directed acyclic graphs (CDAGs). However, previously developed approaches to lower bounds analysis for the red/blue pebble game are very limited in effectiveness when applied to CDAGs of real programs, with computations comprised of multiple sub-computations with differing DAG structure. We address this problem by developing an approach for effectively composing lower bounds based on graph decomposition. We also develop a static analysis algorithm to derive the asymptotic data-access lower bounds of programs, as a function of the problem size and cache size. "
"The standard approach for studying the periodic ARMA model with coefficients that vary over the seasons is to express it in a vector form. In this paper we introduce an alternative method which views the periodic formulation as a time varying univariate process and obviates the need for vector analysis. The specification, interpretation, and solution of a periodic ARMA process enable us to formulate a forecasting method which avoids recursion and allows us to obtain analytic expressions of the optimal predictors. Our results on periodic models are general, analogous to those for stationary specifications, and place the former on the same computational basis as the latter. "
"We consider stationary matter-wave gap solitons realized in Bose--Einstein condensates loaded in one-dimensional (1D) optical lattices and investigate whether the effective 1D equation proposed in [Phys. Rev. A \textbf{77}, 013617 (2008)] can be a reliable alternative to the three-dimensional treatment of this kind of system in terms of the Gross--Pitaevskii equation (GPE). Our results demonstrate that, unlike the standard 1D GPE (which is not applicable in most realistic situations), the above effective model is able to correctly predict the distinctive trajectories characterizing the different gap soliton families as well as the corresponding axial wavefunctions along the entire band gaps. It can also predict the stability properties of the different gap soliton families as follows from both a linear stability analysis and a representative set of numerical computations. In particular, by numerically solving the corresponding Bogoliubov--de Gennes equations we show that the effective 1D model gives the correct spectrum of complex eigenfrequencies responsible for the dynamical stability of the system, thus providing us with a useful tool for the physical description of stationary matter-wave gap solitons in 1D optical lattices. "
"We present an analysis of recent X-ray observations of the symbiotic star AG Peg. The X-ray emission of AG Peg as observed with Swift in 2015 shows considerable variability on time scale of days as variability on shorter time scales might be present as well. Analysis of the X-ray spectra obtained in 2013 and 2015 confirms that AG Peg is an X-ray source of class $\beta$ of the X-ray sources amongst the symbiotic stars. The X-ray emission of AG Peg as observed with ROSAT (1993 June) might well originate from colliding stellar winds (CSW) in binary system. On the other hand, the characteristics of the X-ray emission of AG Peg in 2013 and 2015 (Swift) are hard to accommodate in the framework of the CSW picture. Analysis of the light curves in 2015 shows that the power spectrum of the X-ray variability in AG Peg resembles that of the flicker noise (or flickering) being typical for accretion processes in astronomical objects. This is a sign that CSWs did not play a key role for the X-ray emission from AG Peg in 2013-2015 and a different mechanism (probably accretion) is also getting into play. "
"An integro-differential equation of hyperbolic type, with mixed boundary conditions, is considered. A continuous space-time finite element method of degree one is formulated. A posteriori error representations based on space-time cells is presented such that it can be used for adaptive strategies based on dual weighted residual methods. A posteriori error estimates based on weighted global projections and local projections are also proved. "
"This paper is the first part in a 2 part study of an elementary functorial construction from the category of finite non-abelian groups to a category of singular compact, oriented 2-manifolds. After a desingularization process this construction results in a collection of compact, connected, oriented tesselated smooth surfaces equipped with a closed-cell structure which is face and edge transitive and which has at most 2 orbits of vertices. These tesselated surfaces can also be viewed as abstract 3-polytopes (or as graph embeddings in the corresponding surface) which are either equivar or dual to abstract quasiregular polytopes. This construction generally results in a large collection of tesselated surfaces per group, for example when the construction is applied to \Sigma_6 it yields 4477 tesselated surfaces of 27 distinct genus and even more varieties of tesselation cell structure. We study the distribution of these surfaces in various groups and some interesting resulting tesselations. In a second paper, we show that extensions of groups result in branched coverings between the component surfaces in their decompositions. We also exploit functoriality to obtain interesting faithful, orientation preserving actions of subquotients of these groups and their automorphism groups on these surfaces and in the corresponding mapping class groups. "
"In this paper, we propose a novel sparse signal recovery algorithm called Trainable ISTA (TISTA). The proposed algorithm consists of two estimation units such as a linear estimation unit and a minimum mean squared error (MMSE) estimator-based shrinkage unit. The estimated error variance required in the MMSE shrinkage unit is precisely estimated from a tentative estimate of the original signal. The remarkable feature of the proposed scheme is that TISTA includes adjustable variables controlling a step size and the error variance for the MMSE shrinkage. The variables are adjusted by standard deep learning techniques. The number of trainable variables of TISTA is equal to the number of iteration rounds and it is much smaller than that of known learnable sparse signal recovery algorithms. This feature leads to highly stable and fast training processes of TISTA. Computer experiments show that TISTA is applicable to various classes of sensing matrices such as Gaussian matrices, binary matrices and matrices with large condition numbers. Numerical results also demonstrate that TISTA shows significantly faster convergence than those of AMP and LISTA in many cases. "
"Interplanetary (IP) shock plays a key role in causing the global dynamic changes of the geospace environment. For the perspective of Solar-Terrestrial relationship, it will be of great importance to estimate the properties of post-shock solar wind simply and accurately. Motivated by this, we performed a statistical analysis of IP shocks during 1998-2008, focusing on the significantly different responses of two well-used geomagnetic indices (SYMH and AL) to the passive of two types of IP shocks. For the IP shocks with northward IMF (91 cases), the SYMH index keeps on the high level after the sudden impulses (SI) for a long time. Meanwhile, the change of AL index is relative small, with an mean value of only -29 nT. However, for the IP shocks with southward IMF (92 cases), the SYMH index suddenly decreases at a certain rate after SI, and the change of AL index is much significant, of -316 nT. Furthermore, the change rate of SYMH index after SI is found to be linearly correlated with the post-shock reconnection E-field (E$_{KL}$). Based on these facts, an inversion model of post-shock IMF orientation and E$_{KL}$ is developed. The model validity is also confirmed by studying 68 IP shocks in the period of 2009-2013. The inversion accuracy of IMF orientation is 88.24%, and the inversion efficiency of E$_{KL}$ is as high as 78%. "
"Given a positive definite binary quadratic form f, let r(n) = |{(x,y): f(x,y)=n}| denote its representation function. In this paper we study linear correlations of these functions. For example, if r_1, ..., r_k are representation functions, we obtain an asymptotic for sum_{n,d} r_1(n) r_2(n+d) ... r_k(n+ (k-1)d). "
"We study the dynamics of super-Eddington accretion flows by performing two-dimensional radiation-hydrodynamic simulations. Compared with previous works, in this paper we include the $T_{\theta\phi}$ component of the viscous stress and consider various values of the viscous parameter $\alpha$. We find that when $T_{\theta\phi}$ is included, the rotational speed of the high-latitude flow decreases, while the density increases and decreases at the high and low latitudes, respectively. We calculate the radial profiles of inflow and outflow rates. We find that the inflow rate decreases inward, following a power law form of $\dot{M}_{\rm in}\propto r^s$. The value of $s$ depends on the magnitude of $\alpha$ and is within the range of $\sim 0.4-1.0$. Correspondingly, the radial profile of density becomes flatter compared with the case of a constant $\dot{M}(r)$. We find that the density profile can be described by $\rho(r)\propto r^{-p}$, and the value of $p$ is almost same for a wide range of $\alpha$ ranging from $\alpha=0.1$ to $0.005$. The inward decrease of inflow accretion rate is very similar to hot accretion flows, which is attributed to the mass loss in outflows. To study the origin of outflow, we analyze the convective stability of slim disk. We find that depending on the value of $\alpha$, the flow is marginally stable (when $\alpha$ is small) or unstable (when $\alpha$ is large). This is different from the case of hydrodynamical hot accretion flow where radiation is dynamically unimportant and the flow is always convectively unstable. We speculate that the reason for the difference is because radiation can stabilize convection. The origin of outflow is thus likely because of the joint function of convection and radiation, but further investigation is required. "
"Watson-Crick automata are finite automata working on double strands. Extensive research work has already been done on non-deterministic Watson-Crick automata and on deterministic Watson-Crick automata. In this paper, we introduce a new model of Watson-Crick automata which is reversible in nature named reversible Watson-Crick automata and explore its computational power. We show even though the model is reversible and one way it accepts all regular languages and also analyze the state complexity of the above stated model with respect to non-deterministic block automata and non-deterministic finite automata and establish its superiority. We further explore the relation of the reversible model with twin-shuffle language and recursively enumerable languages. "
"The dynamical and radiative properties of the quiescent state (X-ray luminosity $<10^{34}\ {\rm erg s^{-1} cm^{-2}}$) of black hole X-ray transients (BHXTs) remains unclear, mainly because of low-luminosity and poor data quantity. We demonstrate that, the simultaneous multi-wavelength (including radio, optical, ultraviolet and X-ray bands) spectrum of V404 Cyg in its bright quiescent state can be well described by the radiation from the companion star and more importantly, the compact jet. Neither the outer thin disc nor the inner hot accretion flow is important in the total spectrum. Together with several additional recent findings, i.e. the power-law X-ray spectrum and the constant X-ray spectral shape (or constant photon index) in contrast to the dramatic change in the X-ray luminosity, we argue the quiescent state spectrum of BHXTs is actually jet-dominated. Observational features consistent with this jet model are also discussed as supporting evidences. "
"Nonlinear PDEs, mean value properties, and stochastic differential games are intrinsically connected. In this short expository note, we will describe how the solutions to certain PDEs (of $p$-Laplacian type) can be interpreted as limits of values of a specific Tug-of-War game, when the step-size $\epsilon$ determining the allowed length of move of a token, decreases to $0$. "
"We prove the existence of ground state in a multidimensional nonlinear Schrodinger model of paraxial beam propagation in isotropic local media with saturable nonlinearity. Such ground states exist in the form of bright counterpropagating solitons. From the proof, a general threshold condition on the beam coupling constant for the existence of such fundamental solitons follows. "
"A scanning tunneling microscope (STM) can do more than atomic imaging and manipulation. Its tunneling current can also be used for the excitation of light, converting electron energy to photon energy. STM based single-molecule electroluminescence can be realized by adopting a combined strategy of both efficient electronic decoupling and nanocavity plasmonic enhancement. The emission intensity, upon optimized material combination for the molecule, spacer, tip, and substrate, can be strong and stable enough for performing second-order photon correlation measurements. The observation of an evident photon antibunching effect demonstrates clearly the nature of single-photon emission for single-molecule electroluminescence. Strikingly, the spectral peak of a monomer is found to split when a molecular dimer is artificially constructed through STM manipulation, which suggests that the excitation energy from tunneling electrons is likely to rapidly delocalize over the whole molecular dimer. The spatial distribution of the excitonic coupling for different energy states in a dimer can be visualized in real space through sub-nanometer resolved electroluminescence imaging technique, which correlates very well with the local optical responses predicted in terms of coherent intermolecular dipole-dipole coupling. Furthermore, a single molecule can also couple coherently with a plasmonic nanocavity, resulting in the occurrence of interference-induced Fano resonance. These findings open up new avenues to fabricate electrically driven quantum light sources as well as to study intermolecular energy transfer, field-matter interaction, and molecular optoelectronics, all at the single-molecule level. "
"We investigate signatures of electronic correlations in the narrow-gap semiconductor FeGa$_3$ by means of electrical resistivity and thermodynamic measurements performed on single crystals of FeGa$_3$, Fe$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$Ga$_3$ and FeGa$_{3-y}$Zn$_y$, complemented by a study of the 4$d$ analog material RuGa$_3$. We find that the inclusion of sizable amounts of Mn and Zn dopants into FeGa$_3$ does not induce an insulator-to-metal transition. Our study indicates that both substitution of Zn onto the Ga site and replacement of Fe by Mn introduces states into the semiconducting gap that remain localized even at highest doping levels. Most importantly, using neutron powder diffraction measurements, we establish that FeGa$_3$ orders magnetically above room temperature in a complex structure, which is almost unaffected by the doping with Mn and Zn. Using realistic many-body calculations within the framework of dynamical mean field theory (DMFT), we argue that while the iron atoms in FeGa$_3$ are dominantly in an $S=1$ state, there are strong charge and spin fluctuations on short time scales, which are independent of temperature. Further, the low magnitude of local contributions to the spin susceptibility advocates an itinerant mechanism for the spin response in FeGa$_3$. Our joint experimental and theoretical investigations classify FeGa$_3$ as a correlated band insulator with only small dynamical correlation effects, in which non--local exchange interactions are responsible for the spin gap of 0.4 eV and the antiferromagnetic order. We show that hole doping of FeGa$_3$ leads, within DMFT, to a notable strengthening of many--body renormalizations. "
"We use weak gravitational lensing to analyse the dark matter halos around satellite galaxies in galaxy groups in the CFHTLenS dataset. This dataset is derived from the CFHTLS-Wide survey, and encompasses 154 sq. deg of high-quality shape data. Using the photometric redshifts, we divide the sample of lens galaxies with stellar masses in the range 10^9 Msun to 10^10.5 Msun into those likely to lie in high-density environments (HDE) and those likely to lie in low-density environments (LDE). Through comparison with galaxy catalogues extracted from the Millennium Simulation, we show that the sample of HDE galaxies should primarily (~61%) consist of satellite galaxies in groups, while the sample of LDE galaxies should consist of mostly (~87%) non-satellite (field and central) galaxies. Comparing the lensing signals around samples of HDE and LDE galaxies matched in stellar mass, the lensing signal around HDE galaxies clearly shows a positive contribution from their host groups on their lensing signals at radii of ~500--1000 kpc, the typical separation between satellites and group centres. More importantly, the subhalos of HDE galaxies are less massive than those around LDE galaxies by a factor 0.65 +/- 0.12, significant at the 2.9 sigma level. A natural explanation is that the halos of satellite galaxies are stripped through tidal effects in the group environment. Our results are consistent with a typical tidal truncation radius of ~40 kpc. "
"Motivated by its practical success, we show that the two-dimensional total variation denoiser satisfies a sharp oracle inequality that leads to near optimal rates of estimation for a large class of image models such as bi-isotonic, H\""older smooth and cartoons. Our analysis hinges on properties of the unnormalized Laplacian of the two-dimensional grid such as eigenvector delocalization and spectral decay. We also present extensions to more than two dimensions as well as several other graphs. "
"Topological surgery in dimension $3$ is intrinsically connected with the classification of $3$-manifolds and with patterns of natural phenomena. In this expository paper, we present two different approaches for understanding and visualizing the process of $3$-dimensional surgery. In the first approach, we view the process in terms of its effect on the fundamental group. Namely, we present how $3$-dimensional surgery alters the fundamental group of the initial manifold and present ways to calculate the fundamental group of the resulting manifold. We also point out how the fundamental group can detect the topological complexity of non-trivial embeddings that produce knotting. The second approach can only be applied for standard embeddings. For such cases, we give new visualizations for both types of $3$-dimensional surgery as different rotations of the decompactified $2$-sphere. Each rotation produces a different decomposition of the $3$-sphere which corresponds to a different visualization of the $4$-dimensional process of $3$-dimensional surgery. "
"MD simulations of methane confined between graphite walls with up to 4,800,000 interaction sites, i.e., carbon atoms and methane molecules, are conducted, where the channel width is varied to include both the boundary-dominated regime and the transition to the continuum regime. This proves that MD can be used today to cover the entire range of characteristic lengths for which continuum methods fail. "
"Let $P_r(n)$ be the set of partitions of n with non negative rth differences. Let $\lambda$ be a partition chosen uniformly at random among the set $P_r(n)$. Let $d(\lambda)$ be a positive rth difference chosen uniformly at random in $\lambda$. The aim of this work is to show that for every $m\ge 1$, the probability that $d(\lambda)\ge m$ approaches $m^{-1/r}$ as $n\to\infty$. To prove this result we use bijective, asymptotic/analytic, and probabilistic combinatorics. "
"From the viewpoint of higher dimensional Auslander-Reiten theory, we introduce a new class of finite dimensional algebras of global dimension n, which we call n-representation infinite. They are a certain analog of representation infinite hereditary algebras, and we study three important classes of modules: n-preprojective, n-preinjective and n-regular modules. We observe that their homological behaviour is quite interesting. For instance they provide first examples of algebras having infinite Ext^1-orthogonal families of modules. Moreover we give general constructions of n-representation infinite algebras. Applying Minamoto's theory on Fano algebras in non-commutative algebraic geometry, we describe the category of n-regular modules in terms of the corresponding preprojective algebra. Then we introduce n-representation tame algebras, and show that the category of n-regular modules decomposes into the categories of finite dimensional modules over localizations of the preprojective algebra. This generalizes the classical description of regular modules over tame hereditary algebras. As an application, we show that the representation dimension of an n-representation tame algebra is at least n+2. "
"IEEE 802.11e standard defines two Medium Access Control (MAC) functions to support Quality of Service (QoS) for wireless local area networks: Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA) and HCF Controlled Channel Access (HCCA). EDCA provides fair prioritized QoS support while HCCA guarantees parameterized QoS for the traffics with rigid QoS requirements. The latter shows higher QoS provisioning with Constant Bit Rate (CBR) traffics. However, it does not efficiently cope with the fluctuation of the Variable Bit Rate (VBR) video streams since its reference scheduler generates a schedule based on the mean characteristics of the traffic. Scheduling based on theses characteristics is not always accurate as these tra_cs show high irregularity over the time. In this paper, we propose an enhancement on the HCCA polling mechanism to address the problem of scheduling pre-recorded VBR video streams. Our approach enhances the polling mechanism by feed-backing the arrival time of the subsequent video frame of the uplink traffic obtained through cross-layering approach. Simulation experiments have been conducted on several publicly available video traces in order to show the efficiency of our mechanism. The simulation results reveal the efficiency of the proposed mechanism in providing less delay and high throughput with conserving medium channel through minimizing the number of Null-Frames caused by wasted polls "
"We develop a general model of coherent synchrotron radiation (CSR) impedance with shielding provided by two parallel conducting plates. This model allows us to easily reproduce all previously known analytical CSR wakes and to expand the analysis to the situations not explored before. It reduces calculations of the impedance to taking integrals along the trajectory of the beam. New analytical results are derived for the radiation impedance with shielding for the following orbits: a kink, a bending magnet, a wiggler of finite length, and an infinitely long wiggler. All our formulas are benchmarked agains numerical simulations with the CSRZ computer code. "
"We study the Bose-Hubbard and Fermi-Hubbard model in the limit of large coordination numbers Z (i.e., many tunnelling partners). Via a controlled expansion into powers of 1/Z, we establish a hierarchy of correlations, which facilitates an approximate analytic solution of the quantum evolution. For the Bose-Hubbard model, we derive the growth of phase coherence after a quench from the Mott to the superfluid phase. For a quench within the Mott phase, we find that various local observables approach a quasi-equilibrium state after a finite period of time. However, this state is not thermal, i.e., real thermalisation -- if it occurs -- requires much longer time scales. For a tilted lattice in the Mott state, we calculate the tunnelling probability and find a remarkable analogy to the Sauter-Schwinger effect (i.e., electron-positron pair creation out of the vacuum due to a strong electric field). These analytical results are compared to numerical simulations for finite lattices in one and two dimensions and we find qualitative agreement. Finally, we generalize these studies to the more involved case of the Fermi-Hubbard model. "
"The phase diagrams of correlated systems like cuprates or pnictides high-temperature superconductors are characterized by a topological change of the Fermi surface under continuous variation of an external parameter, the so-called Lifshitz transition. However, the large number of low-temperature instabilities and the interplay of multiple energy scales complicate the study of this phenomenon. Here we first identify the optical signatures of a pressure-induced Lifshitz transition in a clean elemental system, black phosphorus. By applying external pressures above 1.5 GPa, we observe a change in the pressure dependence of the Drude plasma frequency due to the appearance of massless Dirac fermions. At higher pressures, optical signatures of two structural phase transitions are also identified. Our findings suggest that a key fingerprint of the Lifshitz transition in solid state systems, and in absence of structural phase transitions, is a discontinuity of the Drude plasma frequency due to the change of Fermi surface topology. "
"Berry connection is conventionally defined as a static gauge field in the Brillouin zone. Here we show that for three-dimensional (3d) time-reversal invariant superconductors, a generalized Berry gauge field behaves as a fluctuating field of a Chern-Simons gauge theory. The gapless nodal lines in the momentum space play the role of Wilson loop observables, while their linking and knot invariants modify the gravitational theta angle. This angle induces a topological gravitomagnetoelectric effect where a temperature gradient induces a rotational energy flow. We also show how topological strings may be realized in the 6 dimensional phase space, where the physical space defects play the role of topological D-branes. "
"This is the first of a series of papers. Our final goal is to establish Deligne-Riemann-Roch isomorphisms in various settings. In this paper, we establish a uniqueness theorem for Deligne pairings and prove the degree $1$ part of the Deligne-Riemann-Roch theorem. "
"We argue that some scenarios for the enigmatic supernova (SN) iPTF14hls and its progenitor require a strong binary interaction. We examine scenarios that attribute the extra power of iPTF14hls to a magnetar, to a late fallback on to the neutron star (NS) that launches jets, to an interaction of the ejecta with a circumstellar matter (CSM), or to a common envelope jets SN (CEJSN). For each of these four scenarios, we study the crucial process that supplies the extra energy and conclude that a binary companion to the progenitor must be present. For the magnetar scenario and late jets we claim that a companion should spin-up the pre-collapse core, in the ejecta-CSM scenario we find that the formation of the equatorial CSM requires a companion, and in the CEJSN where a NS spirals-in inside the giant envelope of the progenitor and launches jets the strong binary interaction is built-in. We argue that these types of strong binary interactions make the scenarios rare and explain the enigmatic nature of iPTF14hls. We further study processes that might accompany the binary interaction, in particular, the launching of jets before, during and after the explosion and their observational consequences. We do not consider the difficulties of the different scenarios and neither do we determine the best scenario for iPTF14hls. We rather focus on the binary nature of these scenarios that might as well explain other rare types of SNe. "
"We analyse the properties of the HI gas distribution in the Auriga project, a set of magnetohydrodynamic cosmological simulations performed with the moving-mesh code AREPO and a physics model for galaxy formation that succeeds in forming realistic late-type galaxies in the 30 Milky Way-sized haloes simulated in this project. We use a simple approach to estimate the neutral hydrogen fraction in our simulation set, which treats low-density and star-forming gas separately, and we explore two different prescriptions to subtract the contribution of molecular hydrogen from the total HI content. The HI gas in the vast majority of the systems forms extended discs although more disturbed morphologies are present. Notwithstanding the general good agreement with observed HI properties -- such as radial profiles and the mass-diameter relation -- the Auriga galaxies are systematically larger and more gas-rich than typical nearby galaxies. Interestingly, the amount of HI gas outside the disc plane correlates with the star formation rate, consistent with a picture where most of this extra-planar HI gas originates from a fountain-like flow. Our findings are robust with respect to the different assumptions adopted for computing the molecular hydrogen fraction and do not vary significantly over a wide range of numerical resolution. The HI modelling introduced in this paper can be used in future work to build artificial interferometric HI data cubes, allowing an even closer comparison of the gas dynamics in simulated galaxies with observations.

"We consider the strictly hyperbolic Cauchy problem \begin{align*} &D_t^m u - \sum\limits_{j = 0}^{m-1} \sum\limits_{|\gamma|+j = m} a_{m-j,\,\gamma}(t,\,x) D_x^\gamma D_t^j u = 0, \newline &D_t^{k-1}u(0,\,x) = g_k(x),\,k = 1,\,\ldots,\,m, \end{align*} for $(t,\,x) \in [0,\,T]\times \mathbb{R}^n$ with coefficients belonging to the Zygmund class $C^s_\ast$ in $x$ and having a modulus of continuity below Lipschitz in $t$. Imposing additional conditions to control oscillations, we obtain a global (on $[0,\,T]$) $L^2$ energy estimate without loss of derivatives for $s \geq \{1+\varepsilon,\,\frac{2m_0}{2-m_0}\}$, where $m_0$ is linked to the modulus of continuity of the coefficients in time. "
"Music is usually highly structured and it is still an open question how to design models which can successfully learn to recognize and represent musical structure. A fundamental problem is that structurally related patterns can have very distinct appearances, because the structural relationships are often based on transformations of musical material, like chromatic or diatonic transposition, inversion, retrograde, or rhythm change. In this preliminary work, we study the potential of two unsupervised learning techniques - Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) and Gated Autoencoders (GAEs) - to capture pre-defined transformations from constructed data pairs. We evaluate the models by using the learned representations as inputs in a discriminative task where for a given type of transformation (e.g. diatonic transposition), the specific relation between two musical patterns must be recognized (e.g. an upward transposition of diatonic steps). Furthermore, we measure the reconstruction error of models when reconstructing musical transformed patterns. Lastly, we test the models in an analogy-making task. We find that it is difficult to learn musical transformations with the RBM and that the GAE is much more adequate for this task, since it is able to learn representations of specific transformations that are largely content-invariant. We believe these results show that models such as GAEs may provide the basis for more encompassing music analysis systems, by endowing them with a better understanding of the structures underlying music.

All finite-dimensional Leibniz algebra bimodules of a Lie algebra $\mathfrak{sl}_2$ over a field of characteristic zero are described.
"The new definition of the energy dependence for the level density parameter including collective effects depends strongly on the semi-classical approach. For this method, defining an accurate single-particle potential is of great importance. The effect of the single-particle potential terms, which are central, spin-orbit, harmonic oscillator, Woods-Saxon and Coulomb potential, both for spherical and deformed cases, on the level density parameter was investigated by examining the local success of the global parameterizations of eight different combinations of these terms. Among these combinations, the sum of the central, spin-orbit, harmonic oscillator and Coulomb potentials, gives the most accurate predictions compared with experimental data. The local selections of the global parameterizations show that the single-particle models, which are based on Woods-Saxon potential as the main term, are more suitable candidates than the models based on harmonic oscillator potential to extrapolate away far from stability. Also it can be concluded that the contribution of the Coulomb interaction, both around the closed and open shells is not neglectable. "
"We present an incentive-compatible polynomial-time approximation scheme for multi-unit auctions with general k-minded player valuations. The mechanism fully optimizes over an appropriately chosen sub-range of possible allocations and then uses VCG payments over this sub-range. We show that obtaining a fully polynomial-time incentive-compatible approximation scheme, at least using VCG payments, is NP-hard. For the case of valuations given by black boxes, we give a polynomial-time incentive-compatible 2-approximation mechanism and show that no better is possible, at least using VCG payments. "
"We prove localized energy estimates for the wave equation in domains with a strictly concave boundary when homogeneous Dirichlet or Neumann conditions are imposed. By restricting the solution to small, frequency dependent, space time collars of the boundary, it is seen that a stronger gain in regularity can be obtained relative to the usual energy estimates. Mixed norm estimates of Strichartz and square function type follow as a result, using the energy estimates to control error terms which arise in a wave packet parametrix construction. While the latter estimates are not new for Dirichlet conditions, the present approach provides an avenue for treating these estimates when Neumann conditions are imposed. The method also treats Schr\""odinger equations with time independent coefficients. "
"We study the stability of Schwarzschild-Tangherlini (ST) black holes in fourth-order gravity which provides a higher dimensional linearized massive equation. The linearized-Ricci tensor perturbation is employed to exhibit unstable modes featuring the Gregory-Laflamme (GL) instability of higher dimensional black strings, in comparison to the stable ST black holes in Einstein gravity. It turns out that the GL instability of the ST black holes in the fourth-order gravity originates from the massiveness, but not a nature of fourth-order derivative theories giving ghost states. "
"We are interested to the multifractal analysis of inhomogeneous Bernoulli products which are also known as coin tossing measures. We give conditions ensuring the validity of the multifractal formalism for such measures. On another hand, we show that these measures can have a dense set of phase transitions. "
"We study the evolution of cooperation in spatial public goods games where, besides the classical strategies of cooperation (C) and defection (D), we consider punishing cooperators (PC) or punishing defectors (PD) as an additional strategy. Using a minimalist modeling approach, our goal is to separately clarify and identify the consequences of the two punishing strategies. Since punishment is costly, punishing strategies loose the evolutionary competition in case of well-mixed interactions. When spatial interactions are taken into account, however, the outcome can be strikingly different, and cooperation may spread. The underlying mechanism depends on the character of the punishment strategy. In case of cooperating punishers, increasing the fine results in a rising cooperation level. In contrast, in the presence of the PD strategy, the phase diagram exhibits a reentrant transition as the fine is increased. Accordingly, the level of cooperation shows a non-monotonous dependence on the fine. Remarkably, punishing strategies can spread in both cases, but based on largely different mechanisms, which depend on the cooperativeness (or not) of punishers. "
"Aboriginal Australians carefully observe the properties and positions of stars, including both overt and subtle changes in their brightness, for subsistence and social application. These observations are encoded in oral tradition. I examine two Aboriginal oral traditions from South Australia that describe the periodic changing brightness in three pulsating, red-giant variable stars: Betelgeuse (Alpha Orionis), Aldebaran (Alpha Tauri), and Antares (Alpha Scorpii). The Australian Aboriginal accounts stand as the only known descriptions of pulsating variable stars in any Indigenous oral tradition in the world. Researchers examining these oral traditions over the last century, including anthropologists and astronomers, missed the description of these stars as being variable in nature as the ethnographic record contained several misidentifications of stars and celestial objects. Arguably, ethnographers working on Indigenous Knowledge Systems should have academic training in both the natural and social sciences. "
"We extend certain homomorphisms defined on the higher Torelli subgroups of the mapping class group to crossed homomorphisms defined on the entire mapping class group. In particular, for every $k\geq 2$, we construct a crossed homomorphism $\epsilon_k$ which extends Morita's homomorphism $\tilde \tau_k$ to the entire mapping class group. From this crossed homomorphism we also obtain a crossed homomorphism extending the $k$th Johnson homomorphism $\tau_k$ to the mapping class group. D. Johnson and S. Morita obtained their respective homomorphisms by considering the action of the mapping class group on the nilpotent truncations of the surface group; our approach is to mimic Morita's construction topologically by using nilmanifolds associated to these truncations. This allows us to take the ranges of these crossed homomorphisms to be certain finite-dimensional real vector spaces associated to these nilmanifolds. "
"We present a general approximation framework for weighted integer covering problems. In a weighted integer covering problem, the goal is to determine a non-negative integer solution $x$ to system $\{ Ax \geq r \}$ minimizing a non-negative cost function $c^T x$ (of appropriate dimensions). All coefficients in matrix $A$ are assumed to be non-negative. We analyze the performance of a very simple primal-dual greedy algorithm and discuss conditions of system $(A,r)$ that guarantee feasibility of the constructed solutions, and a bounded approximation factor. We call system $(A,r)$ a \emph{greedy system} if it satisfies certain properties introduced in this work. These properties highly rely on monotonicity and supermodularity conditions on $A$ and $r$, and can thus be seen as a far reaching generalization of contra-polymatroids. Given a greedy system $(A,r)$, we carefully construct a truncated system $(A',r)$ containing the same integer feasible points. We show that our primal-dual greedy algorithm when applied to the truncated system $(A',r)$ obtains a feasible solution to $(A,r)$ with approximation factor at most $2\delta + 1$, or $2\delta$ if $r$ is non-negative. Here, $\delta$ is some characteristic of the truncated matrix $A'$ which is small in many applications. The analysis is shown to be tight up to constant factors. We also provide an approximation factor of $k (\delta + 1)$ if the greedy algorithm is applied to the intersection of multiple greedy systems. The parameter $k$ is always bounded by the number of greedy systems but may be much smaller. Again, we show that the dependency on $k$ is tight. We conclude this paper with an exposition of classical approximation results based on primal-dual algorithms that are covered by our framework. We match all of the known results. Additionally, we provide some new insight in a generalization of the flow cover on a line problem. "
"We have discovered the pulsar associated with the supernova remnant G21.5-0.9. PSR J1833-1034, with spin period P = 61.8 ms and dispersion measure 169 pc/cc, is very faint, with pulse-averaged flux density of approximately 70 microJy at a frequency of 1.4 GHz, and was first detected in a deep search with the Parkes telescope. Subsequent observations with Parkes and the Green Bank Telescope have confirmed this detection, and yield a period derivative dP/dt = 2.02e-13. These spin parameters imply a characteristic age tau_c = 4.8 kyr and a spin-down luminosity dE/dt = 3.3e37 ergs/s, the latter value exceeded only by the Crab pulsar among the rotation-powered pulsars known in our Galaxy. The pulsar has an unusually steep radio spectrum in the 0.8-2.0 GHz range, with power law index ~3.0, and a narrow single-peaked pulse profile with full-width at half maximum of 0.04P. We have analyzed 350 ks of archival Chandra X-ray Observatory High Resolution Camera (HRC) data, and find a point-like source of luminosity approximately 3e-5dE/dt, offset from the center of an elliptical region of size ~7""x5"" and luminosity approximately 1e-3dE/dt within which likely lies the pulsar wind termination shock. We have searched for X-ray pulsations in a 30 ks HRC observation without success, deriving a pulsed fraction upper limit for a sinusoidal pulse shape of about 70% of the pulsar flux. We revisit the distance to G21.5-0.9 based on HI and CO observations, arguing that it is 4.7+-0.4 kpc. We use existing X-ray and radio observations of the pulsar wind nebula, along with the measured properties of its engine and a recent detection of the supernova remnant shell, to argue that G21.5-0.9 and PSR J1833-1034 are much younger than tau_c, and likely their true age is ~<1000 yr. In that case, the initial spin period of the pulsar was >~55 ms. "
"Recent work by Ishibashi, Maeda, and Mefford shows that the validity of the QNEC is sensitive to the IR regulator that one uses to define the entropy and its variations. In this note we discuss two general options that preserve both the QNEC and a physically-sensible notion of entropy density. We illustrate the application of each through an example. An important guiding principle is that an IR regulator should have a physical interpretation. "
"Active particles driven by colored noise can be approximately mapped onto a system that obeys detailed balance. The effective interactions which can be derived for such a system allow to describe the structure and phase behavior of the active fluid by means of an effective free energy. In this paper we explain why the related thermodynamic results for pressure and interfacial tension do not represent the results one would measure mechanically. We derive a dynamical density functional theory, which in the steady state simultaneously validates the use of effective interactions and provides access to mechanical quantities. Our calculations suggest that in the colored-noise model the mechanical pressure in coexisting phases might be unequal and the interfacial tension can become negative. "
"We present a novel approach to automatically segment magnetic resonance (MR) images of the human brain into anatomical regions. Our methodology is based on a deep artificial neural network that assigns each voxel in an MR image of the brain to its corresponding anatomical region. The inputs of the network capture information at different scales around the voxel of interest: 3D and orthogonal 2D intensity patches capture the local spatial context while large, compressed 2D orthogonal patches and distances to the regional centroids enforce global spatial consistency. Contrary to commonly used segmentation methods, our technique does not require any non-linear registration of the MR images. To benchmark our model, we used the dataset provided for the MICCAI 2012 challenge on multi-atlas labelling, which consists of 35 manually segmented MR images of the brain. We obtained competitive results (mean dice coefficient 0.725, error rate 0.163) showing the potential of our approach. To our knowledge, our technique is the first to tackle the anatomical segmentation of the whole brain using deep neural networks. "
"In this paper we present a deep-learning model that competed at SemEval-2018 Task 2 ""Multilingual Emoji Prediction"". We participated in subtask A, in which we are called to predict the most likely associated emoji in English tweets. The proposed architecture relies on a Long Short-Term Memory network, augmented with an attention mechanism, that conditions the weight of each word, on a ""context vector"" which is taken as the aggregation of a tweet's meaning. Moreover, we initialize the embedding layer of our model, with word2vec word embeddings, pretrained on a dataset of 550 million English tweets. Finally, our model does not rely on hand-crafted features or lexicons and is trained end-to-end with back-propagation. We ranked 2nd out of 48 teams. "
"With the emerging big data applications of Machine Learning, Speech Recognition, Artificial Intelligence, and DNA Sequencing in recent years, computer architecture research communities are facing the explosive scale of various data explosion. To achieve high efficiency of data-intensive computing, studies of heterogeneous accelerators which focus on latest applications, have become a hot issue in computer architecture domain. At present, the implementation of heterogeneous accelerators mainly relies on heterogeneous computing units such as Application-specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC), Graphics Processing Unit (GPU), and Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). Among the typical heterogeneous architectures above, FPGA-based reconfigurable accelerators have two merits as follows: First, FPGA architecture contains a large number of reconfigurable circuits, which satisfy requirements of high performance and low power consumption when specific applications are running. Second, the reconfigurable architectures of employing FPGA performs prototype systems rapidly and features excellent customizability and reconfigurability. Nowadays, in top-tier conferences of computer architecture, emerging a batch of accelerating works based on FPGA or other reconfigurable architectures. To better review the related work of reconfigurable computing accelerators recently, this survey reserves latest high-level research products of reconfigurable accelerator architectures and algorithm applications as the basis. In this survey, we compare hot research issues and concern domains, furthermore, analyze and illuminate advantages, disadvantages, and challenges of reconfigurable accelerators. In the end, we prospect the development tendency of accelerator architectures in the future, hoping to provide a reference for computer architecture researchers. "
"Let F(R^n) be the algebra of Fourier transforms of functions from L_1(R^n), K(R^n) be the algebra of Fourier transforms of bounded complex Borel measures in R^n and W be Wiener algebra of continuous 2pi-periodic functions with absolutely convergent Fourier series. New properties of functions from these algebras are obtained. Some conditions which determine membership of f in F(R) are given. For many elementary functions f the problem of belonging f to F(R) can be resolved easily using these conditions. We prove that the Hilbert operator is a bijective isometric operator in the Banach spaces W_0, F(R), K(R)-A_1 (A_1 is the one-dimension space of constant functions). We also consider the classes M_k, which are similar to the Bochner classes F_k, and obtain integral representation of the Carleman transform of measures of M_k by integrals of some specific form. "
"Let $F$ be a field and let $F^{r\times s}$ denote the space of $r\times s$ matrices over $F$. Given equinumerous subsets $\mathcal{A}=\{A_i\mid i \in I\}\subseteq F^{r\times r}$ and $\mathcal{B}=\{B_i\mid i\in I\}\subseteq F^{s\times s}$ we call the subspace $C(\mathcal{A},\mathcal{B}):=\{X\in F^{r\times s}\mid A_iX=XB_i\ {\rm for }\ i\in I\}$ an \emph{intertwining code}. We show that if $C(\mathcal{A},\mathcal{B})\ne\{0\}$, then for each $i\in I$, the characteristic polynomials of $A_i$ and $B_i$ and share a nontrivial factor. We give an exact formula for $k=\dim(C(\mathcal{A},\mathcal{B}))$ and give upper and lower bounds. This generalizes previous work in this area. Finally we construct intertwining codes with large minimum distance when the field is not `too small'. We give examples of codes where $d=rs/k=1/R$ is large where the minimum distance, dimension, and rate of the linear code $C(\mathcal{A},\mathcal{B})$ by $d$, $k$, and $R=k/rs$, respectively. "
"The probability distribution function (PDF) of the ground-state energy in the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick spin-glass model is numerically determined by collecting a large statistical sample of ground states, computed using a genetic algorithm. It is shown that the standard deviation of the ground-state energy per spin scales with the number of spins, N, as N^{-\rho} with \rho \simeq 0.765, but the value \rho=3/4 is also compatible with the data, while the previously proposed value \rho=5/6 is ruled out. The PDF satisfies finite-size scaling with a non-Gaussian asymptotic PDF, which can be fitted remarkably well by the Gumbel distribution for the m-th smallest element in a set of random variables, with m \simeq 6. "
"In this note, we explore the correspondence between four-dimensional flat space S-matrix and two-dimensional CFT proposed by Pasterski et al. We demonstrate that the factorization singularities of an n-point cubic diagram reproduces the AdS Witten diagrams if mass conservation is imposed at each vertex. Such configuration arises naturally if we consider the 4-dimensional S-matrix as a compactified massless 5-dimensional theory. This identification allows us to rewrite the massless S-matrix in the CHY formulation, where the factorization singularities are re-interpreted as factorization limits of a Riemann sphere. In this light, the map is recast into a form of 2d/2d correspondence. "
"We report a density functional study of the electronic structure and magnetism of Y2Ni7. The results show itinerant magnetism very similar to that in the weak itinerant ferromagnet Ni3Al. The electropositive Y atoms in Y2Ni7 serves to donate charge to the Ni host mostly in the form of $s$ electrons. The non-spin-polarized state shows a high density of states at the Fermi level, N(EF) due to flat bands. This leads to the ferromagnetic instability. However, there are also several much more dispersive bands crossing E(F), which should promote the conductivity. Spin fluctuation effects appear to be comparable to or weaker than Ni3Al, based on comparison with experimental data. Y2Ni7 provides a uniaxial analogue to cubic Ni3Al for studying weak itinerant ferromagnetism, suggesting detailed measurements of its low temperature physical properties and spin fluctuations, as well experiments under pressure.

"Excited states of the neutron deficient $^{103}$Cd nucleus have been investigated via the $^{72}$Ge($^{35}$Cl, p3n) reaction at beam energy of 135 MeV by use of in-beam spectroscopic methods. Gamma rays depopulating the excited states were detected using the Gammasphere spectrometer with high-fold $\gamma$-ray coincidences. A quadrupole $\gamma$-ray coincidence analysis ($\gamma^{4}$) has been used to extend the known level scheme. The positive parity levels have been established up to $J = 35/2\hbar$ and $E_{x} = 7.071$ MeV. In addition to the observation of highly-fragmented level scheme belonging to the positive-parity sequences at E$_{x}\sim$ 5 MeV, the termination of a negative-parity sequence connected by $E2$ transitions has been established at $J = 47/2 \hbar$ and $E_{x} = 11.877$ MeV. The experimental results corresponding to both the positive- and negative-parity sequences have been theoretically interpreted in the framework of the core particle coupling model. Evidence is presented for a shape change from collective prolate to non-collective oblate above the $J^{\pi} = 39/2^{-}$ (8011 keV) level and for a smooth termination of the negative-parity band. "
"In the vicinity of their resonance frequency, piezoelectric resonators are highly sensitive to small perturbations. The present report is focussed on the magnetic field as a perturbation source. First, magneto-dielectric modulation of more than 10% is achieved at room temperature on both ferroelectric single crystals and quartz discs. Since such piezoelectric resonators are now available as membranes directly integrated on Silicon wafer, we have checked the magneto-dielectric modulation in such resonators. We show here for the first time that a moderate magnetic field of 2.104 Oersteds is able to efficiently tune the impedance of these resonators in their resonance window. "
"Dijet production has been measured in pPb collisions at a nucleon-nucleon centre-of-mass energy of 5.02 TeV. A data sample corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 35 inverse nanobarns was collected using the Compact Muon Solenoid detector at the Large Hadron Collider. The dijet transverse momentum balance, azimuthal angle correlations, and pseudorapidity distributions are studied as a function of the transverse energy in the forward calorimeters (ETHFfour). For pPb collisions, the dijet transverse momentum ratio and the width of the distribution of dijet azimuthal angle difference are comparable to the same quantities obtained from a simulated pp reference and insensitive to ETHFfour. In contrast, the mean value of the dijet pseudorapidity is found to change monotonically with increasing ETHFfour, indicating a correlation between the energy emitted at large pseudorapidity and the longitudinal motion of the dijet frame. The pseudorapidity distribution of the dijet system in minimum bias pPb collisions is compared with next-to-leading-order perturbative QCD predictions obtained from both nucleon and nuclear parton distribution functions, and the data more closely match the latter. "
"I perform a joint counts-in-cells analysis of galaxies of different spectral types using the Las Campanas Redshift Survey (LCRS). Using a maximum-likelihood technique to fit for the relationship between the density fields of early- and late-type galaxies, I find a relative linear bias of $b=0.76\pm 0.02$. This technique can probe the nonlinearity and stochasticity of the relationship as well. However, the degree to which nonlinear and stochastic fits improve upon the linear fit turns out to depend on the redshift range in question. In particular, there seems to be a systematic difference between the high- and low-redshift halves of the data (respectively, further than and closer than $cz\approx 36,000$ km/s); all of the signal of stochasticity and nonlinearity comes from the low-redshift portion. Analysis of mock catalogs shows that the peculiar geometry and variable flux limits of the LCRS do not cause this effect. I speculate that the central surface brightness selection criteria of the LCRS may be responsible. "
"I discuss the physics prospects at future high--energy $e^+ e^-$ linear colliders. After summarizing some aspects of these future machines, I will review a few topics in the Standard Model which can be studied at these colliders: top quark, $W/Z$ vector bosons and Higgs particles physics. A brief discussion on the exploration of extensions of the Standard Model such as Supersymmetry and Grand Unified Theories at $\ee$ colliders will also be given. (Invited talk given at Les Rencontres de Physique de la Vall\'ee d'Aoste, La Thuile March 3-9 1996). "
"A numerical exploration of a gain-loss nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation was carried out utilizing over 180000 core hours to conduct more than 10000 unique simulations in an effort to characterize the model's six dimensional parameter space. The study treated the problem in full generality, spanning a minimum of eight orders of magnitude for each of three linear and nonlinear gain terms and five orders of magnitude for higher order nonlinearities. The gain-loss nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation is of interest as a model for spin wave envelopes in magnetic thin film active feedback rings and analogous driven damped nonlinear physical systems. Bright soliton trains were spontaneously driven out of equilibrium and behaviors stable for tens of thousands of round trip times were numerically identified. Nine distinct complex dynamical behaviors with lifetimes on the order of ms were isolated as part of six identified solution classes. Numerically located dynamical behaviors include: (1) Low dimensional chaotic modulations of bright soliton trains; (2) spatially symmetric/asymmetric interactions of solitary wave peaks; (3) dynamical pattern formation and recurrence; (4) steady state solutions and (5) intermittency. Simulations exhibiting chaotically modulating bright soliton trains were found to qualitatively match previous experimental observations. Ten new dynamical behaviors, eight demonstrating long lifetimes, are predicted to be observable in future experiments. "
"A conjecture of Borwein asserts that for any positive integer $n$ and $k$, the coefficient $a_{3k}$ of $q^{3k}$ in the expansion of $\prod_{j=0}^n (1-q^{3j+1})(1-q^{3j+2})$ is nonnegative. In this paper we prove that for any $0 \leq k\leq n$, there is a constant $0<c<1$ such that $a_{3k}+a_{3(n+1)+3k}+\cdots+a_{3n(n+1)+3k}=\frac {2\cdot 3^{N/3}} {N}(1+O(c^N)).$ In particular, $a_{3k}+a_{3(n+1)+3k}+\cdots+a_{3n(n+1)+3k}>0.$ "
"Motivated by previous suggestions that three-body hard-core interactions in lower-dimensional ultracold Bose gases might provide a way for creation of non-Abelian anyons, the exact ground state of a harmonically trapped 1D Bose gas with three-body hard-core interactions is constructed by duality mapping, starting from an $N$-particle ideal gas of mixed symmetry with three-body nodes, which has double occupation of the lowest harmonic oscillator orbital and single occupation of the next $N-2$ orbitals. It has some similarity to the ground state of a Tonks-Girardeau gas, but is more complicated. It is proved that in 1D any system of $N\ge 3$ bosons with three-body hard-core interactions also has two-body soft-core interactions of generalized Lieb-Liniger delta function form, as a consequence of the topology of the configuration space of $N$ particles in 1D, i.e., wave functions with \emph{only} three-body hard core zeroes are topologically impossible. This is in contrast with the case of 2D, where pure three-body hard-core interactions do exist, and are closely related to the fractional quantized Hall effect. The exact ground state is compared with a previously-proposed Pfaffian-like approximate ground state, which satisfies the three-body hard-core constraint but is not an exact energy eigenstate. Both the exact ground state and the Pfaffian-like approximation imply two-body soft-core interactions as well as three-body hard-core interactions, in accord with the general topological proof. "
"At CLEO, charmonium spectroscopy is pursued both thorugh e+e- annihilation data taken in the Upsilon region and more recently at psi(2S). A nmber of first observations (eta_c', h_c, pi and K form factors) have been made, and numerous high precision measurements have been made in radiative and hadronic decays of charmonium resonances. A brief report of these contributions is presented. "
"A communication setup is considered where a transmitter wishes to simultaneously sense its channel state and convey a message to a receiver. The state is estimated at the transmitter by means of generalized feedback, i.e. a strictly causal channel output that is observed at the transmitter. The scenario is motivated by a joint radar and communication system where the radar and data applications share the same frequency band. For the case of a memoryless channel with i.i.d. state sequences, we characterize the capacity-distortion tradeoff, defined as the best achievable rate below which a message can be conveyed reliably while satisfying some distortion constraint on state sensing. An iterative algorithm is proposed to optimize the input probability distribution. Examples demonstrate the benefits of joint sensing and communication as compared to a separation-based approach. "
"Motivated by the Moore-Segal axioms for an open-closed topological field theory, we consider planar open string topological field theories. We rigorously define a category 2Thick whose objects and morphisms can be thought of as open strings and diffeomorphism classes of planar open string worldsheets. Just as the category of 2-dimensional cobordisms can be described as the free symmetric monoidal category on a commutative Frobenius algebra, 2Thick is shown to be the free monoidal category on a noncommutative Frobenius algebra, hence justifying this choice of data in the Moore-Segal axioms. Our formalism is inherently categorical allowing us to generalize this result. As a stepping stone towards topological membrane theory we define a 2-category of open strings, planar open string worldsheets, and isotopy classes of 3-dimensional membranes defined by diffeomorphisms of the open string worldsheets. This 2-category is shown to be the free (weak monoidal) 2-category on a `categorified Frobenius algebra', meaning that categorified Frobenius algebras determine invariants of these 3-dimensional membranes.

"The analysis of radial velocities of interstellar spectral features: CH, CH$^{+}$ as well as 4964 and 6196 diffuse interstellar bands, seen in spectra of HD 151932 and 152233, suggests that carrier of the former is spatially correlated with CH while that of the latter -- with CH$^{+}$. A further analysis, done in this paper and based on the sample of 106 reddened OB stars, partly confirms this suggestion, showing that the CH column density correlates indeed much better with the equivalent width of the 4964 DIB than with that of the 6196 DIB. However, the strengths of the 6196 DIB correlate only marginally better with CH$^+$ than with CH. "
"Recent results concerning the topological properties of random geometrical sets have been successfully applied to the study of the morphology of clusters in percolation theory. This approach provides an alternative way of inspecting the critical behaviour of random systems in statistical mechanics. For the 2d q-states Potts model with q <= 6, intensive and accurate numerics indicates that the average of the Euler characteristic (taken with respect to the Fortuin-Kasteleyn random cluster measure) is an order parameter of the phase transition. "
"We study linear series on a general curve of genus $g$, whose images are exceptional with regard to their secant planes. Working in the framework of an extension of Brill-Noether theory to pairs of linear series, we prove that a general curve has no linear series with exceptional secant planes, in a very precise sense, whenever the total number of series is finite. Next, we partially solve the problem of computing the number of linear series with exceptional secant planes in a one-parameter family in terms of tautological classes associated with the family, by evaluating our hypothetical formula along judiciously-chosen test families. As an application, we compute the number of linear series with exceptional secant planes on a general curve equipped with a one-dimensional family of linear series. We pay special attention to the extremal case of $d$-secant $(d-2)$-planes to $(2d-1)$-dimensional series, which appears in the study of Hilbert schemes of points on surfaces. In that case, our formula may be rewritten in terms of hypergeometric series, which allows us both to prove that it is nonzero and to deduce its asymptotics in $d$. "
"The effects of anneal-tuning of single-crystalline samples of CaFe$_2$As$_2$ synthesized via a molten Sn flux method are investigated using x-ray diffraction, chemical composition, electrical transport and magnetic susceptibility measurements in order to understand the role of growth conditions on the resultant phase diagram. Previous studies of CaFe$_2$As$_2$ crystals synthesized using a self-flux (FeAs) method revealed an ability to tune the structural and magnetic properties of this system by control of post-synthesis annealing conditions, resulting in an ambient pressure phase diagram that spans from tetragonal/orthorhombic antiferromagnetism to the collapsed tetragonal phase of this system. In this work, we compare previous results to those obtained on crystals synthesized via Sn flux, finding similar tunability in both self- and Sn-flux cases, but less sensitivity to annealing temperatures in the latter case, resulting in a temperature-shifted phase diagram. "
"Dedicated application-specific CT systems are popular solutions to high-resolution clinical needs. Some applications, such as mammography and extremities imaging, require spatial resolution beyond current capabilities. Thorough understanding of system properties may help tailor system design, acquisition protocols, and reconstruction algorithms to improve image quality. Using a high-fidelity measurement model, we analyze the effects of shift-variant focal spot blur due to depth-dependence and anode angulation on image quality throughout the three-dimensional field of view of a simulated extremities scanner. A model of the shift-variant blur associated with this device is then incorporated into a Model-Based Iterative Reconstruction (MBIR) algorithm, which is then compared to FDK and MBIR with simpler blur models at select locations throughout the field of view. We show that shift-variant focal spot blur leads to location-dependent imaging performance. Furthermore, changing the orientation of the X-ray tube alters this spatial dependence. The analysis suggests methods to improve imaging performance based on specific image quality needs. The results also demonstrate that image quality can be improved by combining accurate blur modeling with MBIR. Specifically, across the entire field of view, MBIR with shift-variant blur modeling yielded the best image quality, followed by MBIR with a shift-invariant blur model, MBIR with an identity blur model, and FDK, respectively. These results suggest a number of opportunities for the optimization of imaging system performance in the hardware setup, the imaging protocol, and the reconstruction approach. While the high-fidelity models used here are applied using the specifications of a dedicated extremities imaging system, the methods are general and may be applied to optimize imaging performance in any CT system. "
"Higgs boson and massive-graviton productions in association with two jets via vector-boson fusion (VBF) processes and their decays into a vector-boson pair at hadron colliders are studied. They include scalar and tensor boson production processes via weak-boson fusion in quark-quark collisions, gluon fusion in quark-quark, quark-gluon and gluon-gluon collisions, as well as their decays into a pair of weak bosons or virtual gluons which subsequently decay into $\ell\bar\ell$, $q\bar q$ or $gg$. We give the helicity amplitudes explicitly for all the VBF subprocesses, and show that the VBF amplitudes dominate the exact matrix elements not only for the weak-boson fusion processes but also for all the gluon fusion processes when appropriate selection cuts are applied, such as a large rapidity separation between two jets and a slicing cut for the transverse momenta of the jets. We also show that our off-shell vector-boson current amplitudes reduce to the standard quark and gluon splitting amplitudes with appropriate gluon-polarization phases in the collinear limit. Nontrivial azimuthal angle correlations of the jets in the production and in the decay of massive spin-0 and -2 bosons are manifestly expressed as the quantum interference among different helicity states of the intermediate vector-bosons. Those correlations reflect the spin and the CP nature of the Higgs bosons and the massive gravitons. "
"Correlation information in strongly correlated electron systems can be obtained using an extended Drude model. An interesting method related to the extended Drude model analysis of superconducting optical data was proposed recently, and it has attracted attention from researchers. This method aims to extract the optical self-energy of quasiparticles (or residual unpaired electrons) from measured optical data in the superconducting state. However, this residual optical self-energy is a partial optical self-energy. The interpretation and significance of this partial optical self-energy is unclear. We investigate this method using a reverse process with simple electron-boson spectral density functions. With our obtained results, we conclude that the residual (or partial) optical self-energy is difficult to interpret because it contains unphysical features, in particular, a negative optical effective mass. The present study clarifies the extended Drude analysis method for superconducting optical data. "
"We compare the rate for elastic scattering of neutralinos from various nuclei with the flux of upward muons induced by energetic neutrinos from neutralino annihilation in the Sun and Earth. We consider both scalar and axial-vector interactions of neutralinos with nuclei. We find that the event rate in a kg of germanium is roughly equivalent to that in a $10^5$- to $10^7$-m$^2$ muon detector for a neutralino with primarily scalar coupling to nuclei. For an axially coupled neutralino, the event rate in a 50-gram hydrogen detector is roughly the same as that in a 10- to 500-m$^2$ muon detector. Expected experimental backgrounds favor forthcoming elastic-scattering detectors for scalar couplings while the neutrino detectors have the advantage for axial-vector couplings. "
"A number of observables are constructed which can give useful information on instanton ensembles.The basic properties used are : (1) Instantons are SU(2) configurations ,(2)They are self-dual or antiself-dual. "
"We present a theoretical approach to optical spectroscopy of open nonequilibrium systems, which generalizes traditional nonlinear optical spectroscopy tools by imposing charge and energy conservation at all levels of approximation. Both molecular and radiation field degrees of freedom are treated quantum mechanically. The formulation is based on the nonequilibrium Green's function (NEGF) approach and a double sided Feynman diagrammatic representation of the photon flux is developed. Numerical simulations are presented for a model system. Our study bridges the theoretical approaches of quantum transport and optical spectroscopy and establishes a firm basis for applying traditional tools of nonlinear optical spectroscopy in molecular optoelectronics. "
"We have investigated the preparation and bulk magnetic properties of NaxCoO2 in the range 0.5<x<0.95, including those for single crystals grown by the floating-zone method in an image furnace. To characterize the samples and ascertain their quality we performed x-ray powder diffraction, electron-probe microanalysis (EPMA) and magnetization measurements. Based on our findings we are able to report conditions for the preparation of single-phase polycrystalline and single-crystal samples in the range 0.65<x<0.95. For lower concentration samples, however, i.e. x<0.65, residual Co3O4 impurities above the detectable limit remained, and conditions to eliminate this have still to be identified. Investigations of the anisotropic magnetization of NaxCoO2 single crystals show: (i) transitions at ~320 K, ~275K and ~22 K present for all Na doping levels investigated, (ii) a strong increase in magnetization below ~8 K, (iii) a crossover in sense for the anisotropy around 8-10 K, and (iv) a hysteresis in the magnetization for certain Na doping levels at temperatures below ~15 K. Notably, neither of the high temperature anomalies (275 K, 320 K) could be observed in the powder samples. "
"In this paper, we consider positioning with observed-time-difference-of-arrival (OTDOA) for a device deployed in long-term-evolution (LTE) based narrow-band Internet-of-things (NB-IoT) systems. We propose an iterative expectation-maximization based successive interference cancellation (EM-SIC) algorithm to jointly consider estimations of residual frequency-offset (FO), fading-channel taps and time-of-arrival (ToA) of the first arrival-path for each of the detected cells. In order to design a low complexity ToA detector and also due to the limits of low-cost analog circuits, we assume an NB-IoT device working at a low-sampling rate such as 1.92 MHz or lower. The proposed EM-SIC algorithm comprises two stages to detect ToA, based on which OTDOA can be calculated. In a first stage, after running the EM-SIC block a predefined number of iterations, a coarse ToA is estimated for each of the detected cells. Then in a second stage, to improve the ToA resolution, a low-pass filter is utilized to interpolate the correlations of time-domain PRS signal evaluated at a low sampling-rate to a high sampling-rate such as 30.72 MHz. To keep low-complexity, only the correlations inside a small search window centered at the coarse ToA estimates are upsampled. Then, the refined ToAs are estimated based on upsampled correlations. If at least three cells are detected, with OTDOA and the locations of detected cell sites, the position of the NB-IoT device can be estimated. We show through numerical simulations that, the proposed EM-SIC based ToA detector is robust against impairments introduced by inter-cell interference, fading-channel and residual FO. Thus significant signal-to-noise (SNR) gains are obtained over traditional ToA detectors that do not consider these impairments when positioning a device. "
"We present thermal conductivity measurements performed in three short-period (GaAs)_9(AlAs)_5 superlattices. The samples were grown at different temperatures, leading to different small scale roughness and broadening of the interfaces. The cross-plane conductivity is measured with a differential 3w method, at room temperature. The order of magnitude of the overall thermal conductivity variation is consistent with existing theoretical models, although the actual variation is smaller than expected. "
"In this paper, we investigate the network utility maximization problem in FDMA systems. We summarize with a suite of criteria on designing utility functions so as to achieve the global optimization convex. After proposing the general form of the utility functions, we present examples of commonly used utility function forms that are consistent with the criteria proposed in this paper, which include the well-known proportional fairness function and the sigmoidal-like functions. In the second part of this paper, we use numerical results to demonstrate a case study based on the criteria mentioned above, which deals with the subcarrier scheduling problem with dynamic rate allocation in FDMA system. "
"Degenerate dynamical systems are characterized by symplectic structures whose rank is not constant throughout phase space. Their phase spaces are divided into causally disconnected, nonoverlapping regions such that there are no classical orbits connecting two different regions. Here the question of whether this classical disconnectedness survives quantization is addressed. Our conclusion is that in irreducible degenerate systems --in which the degeneracy cannot be eliminated by redefining variables in the action--, the disconnectedness is maintained in the quantum theory: there is no quantum tunnelling across degeneracy surfaces. This shows that the degeneracy surfaces are boundaries separating distinct physical systems, not only classically, but in the quantum realm as well. The relevance of this feature for gravitation and Chern-Simons theories in higher dimensions cannot be overstated. "
"Electrons and photons offer complementary strengths for information processing. Photons are excellent for communication, while electrons are superior for computation and memory. Cognition requires distributed computation to be communicated across the system for information integration. We present reasoning from neuroscience, network theory, and device physics supporting the conjecture that large-scale cognitive systems will benefit from electronic devices performing synaptic, dendritic, and neuronal information processing operating in conjunction with photonic communication. On the chip scale, integrated dielectric waveguides enable fan-out to thousands of connections. On the system scale, fiber and free-space optics can be employed. The largest cognitive systems will be limited by the distance light can travel during the period of a network oscillation. We calculate that optoelectronic networks the area of a large data center ($10^5$\,m$^2$) will be capable of system-wide information integration at $1$\,MHz. At frequencies of cortex-wide integration in the human brain ($4$\,Hz, theta band), optoelectronic systems could integrate information across the surface of the earth. "
"The first elastic electron scattering has been successfully performed at the self-confining RI ion target (SCRIT) facility, the world's first electron scattering facility for exotic nuclei. The SCRIT technique achieved high luminosity (over 10$^{27}$~cm$^{-2}$s$^{-1}$, sufficient for determining the nuclear shape) with only 10$^8$ target ions. While $^{132}$Xe used in this time as a target is stable isotope, the charge density distribution was firstly extracted from the momentum transfer distributions of the scattered electrons by comparing the results with those calculated by a phase shift calculation. "
"In this paper, we propose an efficient reliability based segmentation-discarding decoding (SDD) algorithm for short block-length codes. A novel segmentation-discarding technique is proposed along with the stopping rule to significantly reduce the decoding complexity without a significant performance degradation compared to ordered statistics decoding (OSD). In the proposed decoder, the list of test error patterns (TEPs) is divided into several segments according to carefully selected boundaries and every segment is checked separately during the reprocessing stage. Decoding is performed under the constraint of the discarding rule and stopping rule. Simulations results for different codes show that our proposed algorithm can significantly reduce the decoding complexity compared to the existing OSD algorithms in literature. "
"Wireless objects equipped with multiple antennas are able to simultaneously transmit multiple packets by exploiting the channel's spatial dimensions. In this paper, we study the benefits of such Multiple Packet Transmission (MPT) approach, when it is used in combination with a Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) protocol for fully interconnected networks, addressing the interactions between the two mechanisms and showing the performance gains that can be achieved. To this end, a very simple Media Access Control (MAC) protocol that captures the fundamental properties and tradeoffs of a CSMA/CA channel access protocol supporting MPT is introduced. Using this protocol as a reference, a new analytical model is presented for the case of non-saturated traffic sources with finite buffer space. Simulation results show that the analytical model is able to accurately characterize the steady-state behaviour of the reference protocol for different number of antennas and different traffic loads, providing a useful tool for understanding the performance gains achieved by MAC protocols supporting MPT. "
"We point out that the intrinsic relationship between space and momentum in quantum physics through the uncertainty principle has potential implications for momentum anisotropy in heavy-ion collisions. Using a harmonic oscillator potential we calculate the elliptic anisotropy and find it to be sizeable compared to elliptic flow measurements in nuclear collisions. Our results question the validity of the completely hydrodynamic interpretation of anisotropic flow data, and highlight the importance of including quantum physics in hydrodynamic calculations which has largely been neglected so far. "
"We found that in 156Dy and 162Yb the lowest odd spin gamma-vibrational states transform to the wobbling excitations after the backbending, associated with the transition from axially-symmetric to nonaxial shapes. The analysis of quadrupole electric transitions determines uniquely the sign of the gamma-deformation in both nuclei after the transition point. "
"The possibility that leptons, quarks or both might be highly relativistic bound states of a spin-0 and spin-1/2 constituent bound by minimal electrodynamics is discussed. Typically, strongly bound solutions of the Bethe-Salpeter equation exist only when the coupling constant is on the order of or greater than unity. For the bound-state system discussed here, there exist two classes of boundary conditions that could yield strongly bound solutions with coupling constants on the order of the electromagnetic fine structure constant. In both classes the bound state must have spin one half, thus providing a possible explanation for the absence of higher-spin leptons and quarks. "
"We study models of gauge mediation with strongly coupled hidden sectors, employing a hard wall background as an holographic dual description. The structure of the soft spectrum depends crucially on the boundary conditions one imposes on bulk fields at the IR wall. Generically, vector and fermion correlators have poles at zero momentum, leading to gauge mediation by massive vector messengers and/or generating Dirac gaugino masses. Instead, non-generic choices of boundary conditions let one cover all of GGM parameter space. Enriching the background with R-symmetry breaking scalars, the SSM soft term structure becomes more constrained and similar to previously studied top-down models, while retaining the more analytic control the present bottom-up approach offers. "
"One of the first successes of neutral ecology was to predict realistically-broad distributions of rare and abundant species. However, it has remained an outstanding theoretical challenge to describe how this distribution of abundances changes with spatial scale, and this gap has hampered attempts to use observed species abundances as a way to quantify what non-neutral processes are needed to fully explain observed patterns. To address this, we introduce a new formulation of spatial neutral biodiversity theory and derive analytical predictions for the way abundance distributions change with scale. For tropical forest data where neutrality has been extensively tested before now, we apply this approach and identify an incompatibility between neutral fits at regional and local scales. We use this approach derive a sharp quantification of what remains to be explained by non-neutral processes at the local scale, setting a quantitative target for more general models for the maintenance of biodiversity. "
"We study conditions under which spatially extended systems with coupling a la Swift-Hohenberg exhibit spatial patterns induced purely by the presence of quenched dichotomous disorder. Complementing the theoretical results based on a generalized mean-field approximation, we also present numerical simulations of particular dynamical systems that exhibit the proposed phenomenology. "
"Tunnelling is one of the most paradigmatic and evocative phenomena of quantum physics, underlying processes such as photosynthesis and nuclear fusion, as well as devices ranging from SQUID magnetometers to superconducting qubits for quantum computers. The question of how long a particle takes to tunnel, however, has remained controversial since the first attempts to calculate it, which relied on the group delay. It is now well understood that this delay (the arrival time of the transmitted wave packet peak at the far side of the barrier) can be smaller than the barrier thickness divided by the speed of light, without violating causality. There have been a number of experiments confirming this, and even a recent one claiming that tunnelling may take no time at all. There have also been efforts to identify another timescale, which would better describe how long a given particle spends in the barrier region. Here we present a direct measurement of such a time, studying Bose-condensed $^{87}$Rb atoms tunnelling through a 1.3-${\mu}$m thick optical barrier. By localizing a pseudo-magnetic field inside the barrier, we use the spin precession of the atoms as a clock to measure the time it takes them to cross the classically forbidden region. We find a traversal time of 0.62(7) ms and study its dependence on incident energy. In addition to finally shedding light on the fundamental question of the tunnelling time, this experiment lays the groundwork for addressing deep foundational questions about history in quantum mechanics: for instance, what can we learn about where a particle was at earlier times by observing where it is now?

"Let $QD^1(\mathcal{M}_{g,n})$ be the unit cotangent bundle of the moduli space of Riemann surfaces $\mathcal{M}_{g,n}$. There is a metric $d_E$ on $QD^1(\mathcal{M}_{g,n})$ that is locally bi-Lipschitz to the Euclidean metrics defined by systems of period coordinates coming from of short and moderate-length saddle connections. We show the following: if $\mathcal{M}_{g,n}$ is equipped with the Teichm\""uller metric $d_T$, then the projection $(QD^1(\mathcal{M}_{g,n}),d_E) \to (\mathcal{M}_{g,n},d_T)$ is locally a H\""older map. We give a lower bound on the exponent in terms of $g$ and $n$. "
"We reexamine the feasibility of two-photon reactions at DA$\Phi$NE with the KLOE detector excluding the small angle tagging system. Event-rate predictions of interesting channels : $\gamma \gamma \to \pi^0, \eta $ and $\gamma \gamma \to \pi^+ \pi^-, \pi^0 \pi^0$ are discussed. "
"We use 189 new radial velocities, an $R$ band CCD mosiac, archival X-ray images, and gas temperatures to study substructure, masses, luminosity functions, and mass-to-light ratios in A2626 and A2440. The symmetric X-ray emission from A2626 suggests a relaxed, single-component system; however, 159 redshifts reveals a complex, three component cluster at cz~17,500km/s. One components is a typical X-ray bright cluster, a second has a cluster-like galaxy population with lower central galaxy and gas density, and the third is a background structure with field galaxy composition. A comparison of the magnitude distributions within the two subclusters suggests that A2626 is a merger in progress. Virial masses and a composite luminosity function for a region with projected radius r=1.5h^{-1}Mpc yield a mass to light ratio M/L_R~610h. Analysis of the X-ray emission from the primary component yields a gas mass fraction of 2.2h^{-3/2}% and a baryon fraction of 3.4%. A radial infall model implies that the virial mass may be an underestimate. In A2440, deep CCD $R$ band photometry indicates a striking correspondence between the galaxy and gas distributions. The galaxy distribution has three main components, each associated with a giant elliptical galaxy. The two larger peaks in the galaxy distribution coincide with the primary peaks in the X-ray emission, and the third is associated with a significant X-ray surface brightness enhancement. We use this galaxy-gas correspondence and 48 redshifts to argue that the subclusters are bound within a single system, and that the two primary components are beginning to merge. The composite luminosity function and estimates of the subcluster virial masses indicate a mass-to-light ratio from 660h to 880h. "
"Being a task of establishing spatial correspondences, medical image registration is often formalized as finding the optimal transformation that best aligns two images. Since the transformation is such an essential component of registration, most existing researches conventionally quantify the registration uncertainty, which is the confidence in the estimated spatial correspondences, by the transformation uncertainty. In this paper, we give concrete examples and reveal that using the transformation uncertainty to quantify the registration uncertainty is inappropriate and sometimes misleading. Based on this finding, we also raise attention to an important yet subtle aspect of probabilistic image registration, that is whether it is reasonable to determine the correspondence of a registered voxel solely by the mode of its transformation distribution. "
"Two of the most striking and yet unresolved manifestations of the hidden order (HO) in URu2Si2, are associated on one hand with the double-step metamagnetic transitions and on the other with the giant anomalous Nernst signal. Both are observed when a magnetic field is applied along the c-axis. Here we provide for the first time a unified understanding of these puzzling phenomena and the related field-temperature (B-T) phase diagram. We demonstrate that the HO phase at finite fields can be explained with a chiral dxy+idx2-y2 spin density wave, assuming that the zero field HO contains only the time-reversal symmetry preserving idx2-y2 component. We argue that the presence of the field-induced chiral HO can be reflected in a distinctive non-linear B-dependence of the Kerr angle, when a Kerr experiment is conducted for finite fields. This fingerprint can be conclusive for the possible emergence of chirality in the HO. "
"Elliptic flow of direct photons in relativistic heavy ion collisions is believed to be dominated by contribution from thermal radiation of quark gluon plasma up to $p_T$ $\sim 5$ GeV/$c$, although other sources start outshining the thermal contribution at already smaller values of $p_T$ in the direct photon spectrum. The elliptic flow of thermal photons from ideal hydrodynamics considering a smooth initial density distribution under-predicts the PHENIX direct photon data from 200A GeV Au+Au collisions at RHIC by a large margin in the range $1 < p_T < 5$ GeV/$c$. However, a significant enhancement of thermal photon production due to fluctuations in the initial QCD matter density distributions is expected. We show that such fluctuations result in substantially larger photon elliptic flow for $p_T > 2.5 $ GeV/$c$ compared to a smooth initial-state-averaged density profile. The results from event-by-event hydrodynamics are found to be sensitive to the fluctuation size parameter. However, the effects of initial state fluctuations are insufficient to account for the discrepancy to the PHENIX data for direct photon elliptic flow. Furthermore, the photon $v_2$ is reduced even more when we include the NLO pQCD prompt photon component. We also calculate the spectra and elliptic flow of thermal photons for 2.76A TeV Pb+Pb collisions at LHC and for the 0--40% centrality bin. Thermal photons from event-by-event hydrodynamics along with prompt photons from NLO pQCD calculations explain the ALICE preliminary direct photon data well in the region $p_T \ge 2.5$ GeV/c. Similar to RHIC, the elliptic flow results at LHC are again found to be much smaller than the ALICE preliminary $v_2$ data. "
"We report measurements of the de Haas-van Alphen effect in the layered heavy-fermion compound CePt$_2$In$_7$ in high magnetic fields up to 35 T. Above an angle-dependent threshold field, we observed several de Haas-van Alphen frequencies originating from almost ideally two-dimensional Fermi surfaces. The frequencies are similar to those previously observed to develop only above a much higher field of 45 T, where a clear anomaly was detected and proposed to originate from a change in the electronic structure [M. M. Altarawneh et al., Phys. Rev. B 83, 081103 (2011)]. Our experimental results are compared with band structure calculations performed for both CePt$_2$In$_7$ and LaPt$_2$In$_7$, and the comparison suggests localized $f$ electrons in CePt$_2$In$_7$. This conclusion is further supported by comparing experimentally observed Fermi surfaces in CePt$_2$In$_7$ and PrPt$_2$In$_7$, which are found to be almost identical. The measured effective masses in CePt$_2$In$_7$ are only moderately enhanced above the bare electron mass $m_0$, from 2$m_0$ to 6$m_0$. "
"Frequency offset modulation (FOM) is proposed as a new concept to provide both high energy efficiency and high spectral efficiency for communications. In the FOM system, an array of transmitters (TXs) is deployed and only one TX is activated for data transmission at any signaling time instance. The TX index distinguished by a very slight frequency offset among the entire occupied bandwidth is exploited to implicitly convey a bit unit without any power or signal radiation, saving the power and spectral resources. Moreover, the FOM is characterized by removing the stringent requirements on distinguishable spatial channels and perfect priori channel knowledge, while retaining the advantages of no inter-channel interference and no need of inter-antenna synchronization. In addition, a hybrid solution integrating the FOM and the spatial modulation is discussed to further improve the energy efficiency and spectral efficiency. Consequently, the FOM will be an enabling and green solution to support ever-increasing high-capacity data traffic in a variety of interdisciplinary fields. "
"The convergence of the iterative solutions of the transport equations of cosmic muon and tau neutrinos propagating through Earth is studied and analyzed. For achieving a fast convergence of the iterative solutions of the coupled transport equations of nu_tau, nubar_tau and the associated tau^{\pm} fluxes, a new semi-analytic input algorithm is presented where the peculiar tau-decay contributions are implemented already in the initial zeroth order input. Furthermore, the common single transport equation for muon neutrinos is generalized by taking into account the contributions of secondary nu_mu and nubar_mu fluxes due to the prompt tau-decay tau -> nu_mu initiated by the associated tau flux. Differential and total nadir angle integrated upward-going mu^- + mu^+ event rates are presented for underground neutrino telescopes and compared with the muon rates initiated by the primary nu_mu, nu_tau and tau fluxes. "
"Let $G$ be a real linear algebraic group and $L$ a finitely generated cosimplicial group. We prove that the space of homomorphisms $Hom(L_n,G)$ has a homotopy stable decomposition for each $n\geq 1$. When $G$ is a compact Lie group, we show that the decomposition is $G$-equivariant with respect to the induced action of conjugation by elements of $G$. The spaces $Hom(L_n,G)$ assemble into a simplicial space $Hom(L,G)$. When $G=U$ we show that its geometric realization $B(L,U)$, has a non-unital $E_\infty$-ring space structure whenever $Hom(L_0,U(m))$ is path connected for all $m\geq1$. "
"The Noble Prize in physics 2016 motivates one to study different aspects of topological properties and topological defects as their related objects. Considering the significant role of the topological defects (especially magnetic strings) in cosmology, here, we will investigate three dimensional horizonless magnetic solutions in the presence of two generalizations: massive gravity and nonlinear electromagnetic field. The effects of these two generalizations on properties of the solutions and their geometrical structure are investigated. The differences between de Sitter and anti de Sitter solutions are highlighted and conditions regarding the existence of phase transition in geometrical structure of the solutions are studied. "
The gluon collision process that creates a heavy-quark-antiquark pair with small relative momentum and large transverse momentum predicts at leading-order in the QCD coupling constant that the transverse polarization of the pair should increase with its transverse momentum. Measurements at the Fermilab Tevatron of the polarization of charmonium and bottomonium states with respect to a particular spin-quantization axis are inconsistent with this prediction. However the predicted rate of approach to complete transverse polarization depends on the choice of spin-quantization axis. We introduce axes that maximize and minimize the transverse polarization from the leading-order gluon collision process. They are determined by the direction of the jet that provides most of the balancing transverse momentum.
"Cocycles are constructed by polynomial expressions for Alexander quandles. As applications, non-triviality of some quandle homology groups are proved, and quandle cocycle invariants of knots are studied. In particular, for an infinite family of quandles, the non-triviality of quandle homology groups is proved for all odd dimensions. "
"The chiral symmetry of QCD shows up in the linear Weyl--Wigner mode at short Euclidean distances or at high temperatures. On the other hand, low-lying hadronic states exhibit the nonlinear Nambu--Goldstone mode. An interesting question was raised as to whether the linear realization of the chiral symmetry is asymptotically restored for highly excited states. We address it in a number of ways. On the phenomenological side we argue that to the extent the meson Regge trajectories are observed to be linear and equidistant, the Weyl--Wigner mode is not realized. This picture is supported by quasiclassical arguments implying that the quark spin interactions in high excitations are weak, the trajectories are linear, and there is no chiral symmetry restoration. Then we use the string/gauge duality. In the top-down Sakai--Sugimoto construction the nonlinear realization of the chiral symmetry is built in. In the bottom-up AdS/QCD construction by Erlich et al., and Karch et al. the situation is more ambiguous. However, in this approach linearity and equidistance of the Regge trajectories can be naturally implemented, with the chiral symmetry in the Nambu--Goldstone mode. Asymptotic chiral symmetry restoration might be possible if a nonlinearity (convergence) of the Regge trajectories in an ""intermediate window"" of $n,J$, beyond the explored domain, takes place. This would signal the failure of the quasiclassical picture. "
"We study the entropy production estimate for the polyatomic ellipsoidal BGK model, which is a relaxation type kinetic model describing the time evolution of polyatomic particle systems. An interesting dichotomy is observed between $0<\theta\leq 1$ and $\theta=0$: In each case, a distinct target Maxwellians should be chosen to estimate the entropy production functional from below by the relative entropy. The time asymptotic equilibrium state toward which the distribution function stabilizes bifurcates accordingly. "
"The properties of the extremely strong magnetic fields of neutron stars affect in a unique way their evolution and the associated phenomenology. Due to the lack of constraints from direct observations, our understanding of the magnetic field configuration in neutron star interiors depends on the progress in theoretical modelling. Here we discuss the effort in building models of magnetized neutron stars focussing on some of the recent results. In particular, we comment on the instability of purely poloidal and purely toroidal magnetic field configurations and on the evidence in favour of the so-called twisted-torus solutions. We conclude with an outlook on the present status of the field and future directions. "
"In this paper, we introduce a new online decision making paradigm that we call Thresholding Graph Bandits. The main goal is to efficiently identify a subset of arms in a multi-armed bandit problem whose means are above a specified threshold. While traditionally in such problems, the arms are assumed to be independent, in our paradigm we further suppose that we have access to the similarity between the arms in the form of a graph, allowing us gain information about the arm means in fewer samples. Such settings play a key role in a wide range of modern decision making problems where rapid decisions need to be made in spite of the large number of options available at each time. We present GrAPL, a novel algorithm for the thresholding graph bandit problem. We demonstrate theoretically that this algorithm is effective in taking advantage of the graph structure when available and the reward function homophily (that strongly connected arms have similar rewards) when favorable. We confirm these theoretical findings via experiments on both synthetic and real data. "
"This paper presents a consensus protocol that achieves max-consensus in multi-agent systems over wireless channels. Interference, a feature of the wireless channel, is exploited: each agent receives a superposition of broadcast data, rather than individual values. With this information, the system endowed with the proposed consensus protocol reaches max-consensus in a finite number of steps. A comparison with traditional approaches shows that the proposed consensus protocol achieves a faster convergence. "
"We introduce a ternary quantum key distribution (QKD) protocol and asymptotic security proof based on three coherent states and homodyne detection. Previous work had considered the binary case of two coherent states and here we nontrivially extend this to three. Our motivation is to leverage the practical benefits of both discrete and continuous (Gaussian) encoding schemes creating a best-of-both-worlds approach; namely, the postprocessing of discrete encodings and the hardware benefits of continuous ones. We present a thorough and detailed security proof in the limit of infinite signal states which allows us to lower bound the secret key rate. We calculate this is in the context of collective eavesdropping attacks and reverse reconciliation postprocessing. Finally, we compare the ternary coherent state protocol to other well-known QKD schemes (and fundamental repeaterless limits) in terms of secret key rates and loss. "
We introduce an generalized action functional describing the equations of motion and the variational equations for any Lagrangian system. Using this novel scheme we are able to generalize Noether's theorem in such a way that to any $n$-parameter continuous symmetry group of the Lagrangian there exist 1) the usual $n$ constants of motion and 2) $n$ extra constants valid in the variational equations. The new constants are related to the infinitesimal generators of the symmetry transformation by relations similar to the ones that stem from the `nonextended' Noether theorem.
"The role of Aharonov-Bohm effect in quantum tunneling is examined when a potential is defined on the $S^1$ and has $N$-fold symmetry. We show that the low-lying energy levels split from the $N$-fold degenerate ground state oscillate as a function of the Aharonov-Bohm phase, from which general degeneracy conditions depending on the magnetic flux is obtained. We apply these results to the spin tunneling in a spin system with $N$-fold rotational symmetry around a hard axis. "
"Purpose: We report what is to our knowledge the initial experience with a new 3-dimensional ultrasound robotic system for prostate brachytherapy assistance, focal therapy and prostate biopsies. Its ability to track prostate motion intraoperatively allows it to manage motions and guide needles to predefined targets. Materials and Methods: A robotic system was created for transrectal ultrasound guided needle implantation combined with intraoperative prostate tracking. Experiments were done on 90 targets embedded in a total of 9 mobile, deformable, synthetic prostate phantoms. Experiments involved trying to insert glass beads as close as possible to targets in multimodal anthropomorphic imaging phantoms. Results were measured by segmenting the inserted beads in computerized tomography volumes of the phantoms. Results: The robot reached the chosen targets in phantoms with a median accuracy of 2.73 mm and a median prostate motion of 5.46 mm. Accuracy was better at the apex than at the base (2.28 vs 3.83 mm, p <0.001), and similar for horizontal and angled needle inclinations (2.7 vs 2.82 mm, p = 0.18). Conclusions: To our knowledge this robot for prostate focal therapy, brachytherapy and targeted prostate biopsies is the first system to use intraoperative prostate motion tracking to guide needles into the prostate. Preliminary experiments show its ability to reach targets despite prostate motion. "
"In 1973 two Salam prot\'{e}g\'{e}s (Derek Capper and the author) discovered that the conformal invariance under Weyl rescalings of the metric tensor $g_{\mu\nu}(x)\rightarrow\Omega^2(x)g_{\mu\nu}(x)$ displayed by classical massless field systems in interaction with gravity no longer survives in the quantum theory. Since then these Weyl anomalies have found a variety of applications in black hole physics, cosmology, string theory and statistical mechanics. We give a nostalgic review. (Talk given at the {\it Salamfest}, ICTP, Trieste, March 1993.) "
"The WW domain of the human Pin1 protein for its simple topology and the large amount of experimental data is an ideal candidate to assess theoretical approaches to protein folding. The purpose of the present work is to compare the reliability of the chemically-based Sorenson/Head-Gordon (SHG) model and a standard native centric model in reproducing through molecular dynamics simulations some of the well known features of the folding transition of this small domain. Our results show that the G\={o} model correctly reproduces the cooperative, two-state, folding mechanism of the WW-domain, while the SHG model predicts a transition occurring in two stages: a collapse followed by a structural rearrangement. The lack of a cooperative folding in the SHG simulations appears to be related to the non-funnel shape of the energy landscape featuring a partitioning of the native valley in sub-basins corresponding to different chain chiralities. However the SHG approach remains more reliable in estimating the $\Phi$-values with respect to G\={o}-like description. This may suggest that the WW-domain folding process is stirred by energetic and topological factors as well, and it highlights the better suitability of chemically-based models in simulating mutations. "
"We present spectroscopic observations with high spectral resolution of eta Car as seen by the SE lobe of the Homunculus nebula over the 2003.5 ""spectroscopic event"". The observed spectra represent the stellar spectrum emitted near the pole of the star and are much less contaminated with nebular emission lines than direct observations of the central object. The ""event"" is qualitatively similar near the pole to what is observed in direct spectra of the star (more equator-on at 45 degree), but shows interesting differences. The observations show that the equivalent width changes of H alpha emission and other lines are less pronounced at the pole than in the line of sight. Also the absorption components appear less variable. A pronounced high-velocity absorption is present near the event in the He I lines indicating a mass-ejection event. This feature is also seen, but less pronounced, in the hydrogen lines. HeII4686 emission is observed for a brief period of time near the event and appears, if corrected for light travel time, to precede similar emission in the direct view. Our observations indicate that the event is probably not only a change in ionization and excitation structure or a simple eclipse-like event. "
We produce an equality between the Gromov-Witten invariants of the moduli space M of rank two odd degree stable vector bundles over a Riemann surface $\Sigma$ and the Donaldson invariants of the algebraic surface $\Sigma \times P^1$. We discuss on to how extent the Quantum cohomology of M determines its Gromow-Witten invariants. Finally we find the isomorphism between the usual cohomology and the Quantum cohomology for the moduli space M over a Riemann surface of genus g=3.
"We initiate the study of definable V-topolgies and show that there is at most one such V-topology on a t-henselian NIP field. Equivalently, we show that if $(K,v_1,v_2)$ is a bi-valued NIP field with $v_1$ henselian (resp. t-henselian) then $v_1$ and $v_2$ are comparable (resp. dependent). As a consequence Shelah's conjecture for NIP fields implies the henselianity conjecture for NIP fields. Furthermore, the latter conjecture is proved for any field admitting a henselian valuation with a dp-minimal residue field. We conclude by showing that Shelah's conjecture is equivalent to the statement that any NIP field not contained in the algebraic closure of a finite field is t-henselian. "
"We present axisymmetric, orbit superposition models for 12 galaxies using data taken with the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) and ground-based observatories. In each galaxy, we detect a central black hole (BH) and measure its mass to accuracies ranging from 10% to 70%. We demonstrate that in most cases the BH detection requires both the HST and ground-based data. Using the ground-based data alone does provide an unbiased measure of the BH mass (provided they are fit with fully general models), but at a greatly reduced significance. The most significant correlation with host galaxy properties is the relation between the BH mass and the velocity dispersion of the host galaxy; we find no other equally strong correlation, and no second parameter that improves the quality of the mass-dispersion relation. We are also able to measure the stellar orbital properties from these general models. The most massive galaxies are strongly biased to tangential orbits near the BH, consistent with binary BH models, while lower-mass galaxies have a range of anisotropies, consistent with an adiabatic growth of the BH. "
"I give an informal overview of the decoherent histories approach to quantum mechanics, due to Griffiths, to Omn\`es, and to Gell-Mann and Hartle is given. Results on the connections between decoherence, records, correlation and entropy are described. The emphasis of the presentation is on understanding the broader meaning of the conditions of consistency and decoherence, and in particular, the extent to which they permit one to assign definite properties to the system. The quantum Brownian motion model is briefly discussed. (To appear in proceedings of the workshop, ""Stochastic Evolution of Quantum States in Open Systems and Measurement Processes"", Budapest, March, 1993, edited by L.Diosi). "
"The texture of high purity superconducting niobium sheets plays an important role in the physical and mechanical properties of high purity niobium sheet that are important for manufacturing of superconducting accelerator cavities. In a particular batch of sheet metal, orientation imaging microscopy showed an inhomogeneous texture from the surface to the mid-thickness of the sheet consisting a gamma fiber, {111}<uvw>), cube fiber, {100}<uvw>), and also some components on the alpha fiber, {hkl}<110>. With uniaxial deformation, peaks on the {uvw}<111> gamma fiber evolve differently depending on the in-plane direction of deformation, and the position in the sample (surface vs. center). Applying a different strain path such as balanced biaxial bulging, leads to development of rotated Goss, {110}<110> components in the texture of the deformed niobium. These results show that the texture of niobium is very sensitive to the deformation and strain path. "
"Numerical solution of nonlinear eigenvalue problems (NEPs) is frequently encountered in computational science and engineering. The applicability of most existing methods is limited by matrix structures, property of eigen-solutions, size of the problem, etc. This paper aims to break those limitations and to develop robust and universal NEP solvers for large-scale engineering applications. The novelty lies in two aspects. First, a rational interpolation approach (RIA) is proposed based on the Keldysh theorem for holomorphic matrix functions. Comparing with the existing contour integral approach (CIA), the RIA provides the possibility to select sampling points in more general regions and has advantages in improving accuracy and reducing computational cost. Second, a resolvent sampling scheme using the RIA is proposed for constructing reliable search spaces for the Rayleigh-Ritz procedure, based on which a robust eigen-solver, denoted by RSRR, is developed for solving general NEPs. RSRR can be easily implemented and parallelized. The advantages of the RIA and the performance of RSRR are demonstrated by a variety of benchmark and practical problems. "
"Durhuus and Jonsson (1995) introduced the class of ""locally constructible"" (LC) 3-spheres and showed that there are only exponentially-many combinatorial types of simplicial LC 3-spheres. Such upper bounds are crucial for the convergence of models for 3D quantum gravity. We characterize the LC property for d-spheres (""the sphere minus a facet collapses to a (d-2)-complex"") and for d-balls. In particular, we link it to the classical notions of collapsibility, shellability and constructibility, and obtain hierarchies of such properties for simplicial balls and spheres. The main corollaries from this study are: 1.) Not all simplicial 3-spheres are locally constructible. (This solves a problem by Durhuus and Jonsson.) 2.) There are only exponentially many shellable simplicial 3-spheres with given number of facets. (This answers a question by Kalai.) 3.) All simplicial constructible 3-balls are collapsible. (This answers a question by Hachimori.) 4.) Not every collapsible 3-ball collapses onto its boundary minus a facet. (This property appears in papers by Chillingworth and Lickorish.) "
"In this paper we introduce a perturbatively super-renormalizable and unitary theory of quantum gravity in any dimension D. The theory presents two entire functions, a.k.a. ""form factors"", and a finite number of local operators required by the quantum consistency of the theory itself. The main reason to introduce the entire functions is to avoid ghosts (states of negative norm) like the one in the four-dimensional Stelle's theory. The new theory is indeed ghost-free since the two entire functions have the property to generalize the Einstein-Hilbert action without introducing new poles in the propagator. The theory is renormalizable at one loop and finite from two loops upward. In this paper we essentially study three classes of form factors, systematically showing the tree-level unitarity. We prove that the gravitation potential is regular in r = 0 for all the choices of form factors compatible with renormalizability and unitarity. We also include Black hole spherical symmetric solutions omitting higher curvature corrections to the equation of motions. For two out of three form factors the solutions are regular and the classical singularity is replaced by a ""de Sitter-like core"" in r=0. For one particular choice of the form factors, we prove that the D-dimensional ""Newtonian cosmology"" is singularity-free and the Universe spontaneously follows a de Sitter evolution at the ""Planck scale"" for any matter content. We conclude the article stating that, in the ultraviolet regime, the spectral dimension takes on different values for the three cases: less than or equal to ""1"" for the first case, ""0"" for the second one and ""2"" for the third one. Once the class of theories compatible with renormalizability and unitarity is defined, the spectral dimension has the same short-distance ""critical value"" or ""accumulation point"" for any value of the topological dimension D. "
"Cross-correlated measurements of thermal noise are performed to determine the electron temperature in nanopatterned channels of a GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructure at 4.2 K. Two-dimensional (2D) electron reservoirs are connected via an extended one-dimensional (1D) electron waveguide network. Hot electrons are produced using a current $I_{\text{h}}$ in a source 2D reservoir, are transmitted through the ballistic 1D waveguide and relax in a drain 2D reservoir. We find that the electron temperature increase ${\Delta}T_{\text{e}}$ in the drain is proportional to the square of the heating current $I_{\text{h}}$, as expected from Joule's law. No temperature increase is observed in the drain when the 1D waveguide does not transmit electrons. Therefore, we conclude that electron-phonon interaction is negligible for heat transport between 2D reservoirs at temperatures below 4.2 K. Furthermore, mode control of the 1D electron waveguide by application of a top-gate voltage reveals that ${\Delta}T_{\text{e}}$ is not proportional to the number of populated subbands $N$, as previously observed in single 1D conductors. This can be explained with the splitting of the heat flow in the 1D waveguide network. "
"A search for T-violating transverse muon polarization ($P_T$) in the $K^{+}\to \pi^{0}\mu^{+}\nu$ decay was performed using kaon decays at rest. A new improved value, $P_T= -0.0017\pm 0.0023 (stat)\pm 0.0011 (syst)$, was obtained giving an upper limit, $| P_T | < 0.0050$. The T-violation parameter was determined to be Im$\xi = -0.0053 \pm 0.0071(stat)\pm 0.0036(syst)$ giving an upper limit, $|$Im$\xi| <0.016$. "
"Software testing is becoming a critical part of the development cycle of embedded devices, enabling vulnerability detection. A well-studied approach of software testing is fuzz-testing (fuzzing), during which mutated input is sent to an input-processing software while its behavior is monitored. The goal is to identify faulty states in the program, triggered by malformed inputs. Even though this technique is widely performed, fuzzing cannot be applied to embedded devices to its full extent. Due to the lack of adequately powerful I/O capabilities or an operating system the feedback needed for fuzzing cannot be acquired. In this paper we present and evaluate a new approach to extract feedback for fuzzing on embedded devices using information the power consumption leaks. Side-channel aware fuzzing is a threefold process that is initiated by sending an input to a target device and measuring its power consumption. First, we extract features from the power traces of the target device using machine learning algorithms. Subsequently, we use the features to reconstruct the code structure of the analyzed firmware. In the final step we calculate a score for the input, which is proportional to the code coverage. We carry out our proof of concept by fuzzing synthetic software and a light-weight AES implementation running on an ARM Cortex-M4 microcontroller. Our results show that the power side-channel carries information relevant for fuzzing. "
"A duality transformation that interrelates expanding and contracting cosmological models is shown to single out a duality invariant, interacting two-component description of any irrotational, geodesic and shearfree cosmic medium with vanishing three curvature scalar. We apply this feature to a system of matter and radiation, to a mixture of dark matter and dark energy, to minimal and conformal scalar fields, and to an enlarged Chaplygin gas model of the cosmic substratum. We extend the concept of duality transformations to cosmological perturbations and demonstrate the invariance of adiabatic pressure perturbations under these transformations. "
"We recast the system of Einstein field equations for Locally Rotationally Symmetric spacetimes into an autonomous system of covariantly defined geometrical variables. The analysis of this autonomous system gives all the important global features of the maximal extension of these spacetimes. We conclude that the dynamical system analysis can be a powerful mathematical tool for qualitative understanding of the global structure of spacetimes covariantly, without actually solving the field equations. "
"In a Hilbert setting, we introduce a new dynamical system and associated algorithms for solving monotone inclusions by rapid methods. Given a maximal monotone operator $A$, the evolution is governed by the time dependent operator $I -(I + \lambda(t) {A})^{-1}$, where the positive control parameter $\lambda(t)$ tends to infinity as $t \to + \infty$. The tuning of $ \lambda (\cdot) $ is done in a closed-loop way, by resolution of the algebraic equation $\lambda \norm{(I + \lambda {A})^{-1}x -x}=\theta$, where $\theta $ is a positive given constant. The existence and uniqueness of a strong global solution for the Cauchy problem follows from Cauchy-Lipschitz theorem. We prove the weak convergence of the trajectories to equilibria, and superlinear convergence under an error bound condition. When $A =\partial f$ is the subdifferential of a closed convex function $f$, we show a $\bigo(1/t^2)$ convergence property of $f(x(t))$ to the infimal value of the problem. Then, we introduce proximal-like algorithms which can be obtained by time discretization of the continuous dynamic, and which share the same fast convergence properties. As distinctive features, we allow a relative error tolerance for the solution of the proximal subproblem similar to the ones proposed in ~\cite{So-Sv1, So-Sv2}, and a large step condition, as proposed in~\cite{MS1,MS2}. For general convex minimization problems, the complexity is $\bigo(1/n^2)$. In the regular case, we show the global quadratic convergence of an associated proximal-Newton method. "
"Today, many extrasolar planets have been detected. Some of them exhibit properties quite different from the planets in our solar system and they have eluded attempts to explain their formation. One such case is HD 149026 b. It was discovered by Sato et al. (2005) . A transit-determined orbital inclination results in a total mass of 114 earth masses. The unusually small radius can be explained by a condensible element core with an inferred mass of 67 earth masses for the best fitting theoretical model. In the core accretion model, giant planets are assumed to form around a growing core of condensible materials. With increasing core mass, the amount of gravitationally bound envelope mass increases. This continues up to the so-called critical core mass -- the largest core allowing a hydrostatic envelope. For larger cores, the lack of static solutions forces a dynamic evolution of the protoplanet in the process accreting large amounts of gas or ejecting the envelope. This would prevent the formation of HD 149026 b. By studying all possible hydrostatic equilibria we could show that HD 149026 b can remain hydrostatic up to the inferred heavy core. This is possible if it is formed in-situ in a relatively low-pressure nebula. This formation process is confirmed by fluid-dynamic calculations using the environmental conditions as determined by the hydrostatic models. We present a quantitative in-situ formation scenario for the massive core planet HD 149026 b. Furthermore we predict a wide range of possible core masses for close-in planets like HD 149026 b. This is different from migration where typical critical core masses should be expected. "
"Ernst Specker considered a particular feature of quantum theory to be especially fundamental, namely that pairwise joint measurability of sharp measurements implies their global joint measurability (https://vimeo.com/52923835). To date, Specker's principle seemed incapable of singling out quantum theory from the space of all general probabilistic theories. In particular, its well-known consequence for experimental statistics, the principle of consistent exclusivity, does not rule out the set of correlations known as almost quantum, which is strictly larger than the set of quantum correlations. Here we show that, contrary to the popular belief, Specker's principle cannot be satisfied in any theory that yields almost quantum correlations. "
Recent tritium beta decay experiments yield unphysical negative best-fit values for the square of the neutrino mass. An unidentified bump-like excess of counts few eV below the endpoint in the electron energy spectrum has been tentatively recognized as the source of this anomaly. It is shown that the repulsive potential acting on the emitted antineutrino and originating in its coherent weak-interaction with the daughter atom may effectively account for this excess.
"We investigate the effect of a fixed forbidden clique minor upon the strong chromatic index, both in multigraphs and in simple graphs. We conjecture for each $k\ge 4$ that any $K_k$-minor-free multigraph of maximum degree $\Delta$ has strong chromatic index at most $\frac32(k-2)\Delta$. We present a construction certifying that if true the conjecture is asymptotically sharp as $\Delta\to\infty$. In support of the conjecture, we show it in the case $k=4$ and prove the statement for strong clique number in place of strong chromatic index. By contrast, we make a basic observation that for $K_k$-minor-free simple graphs, the problem of strong edge-colouring is ""between"" Hadwiger's Conjecture and its fractional relaxation. We also treat $K_k$-minor-free multigraphs of edge-diameter at most $2$. "
"We report a laser noise reduction method by locking it to an actively stabilized fiber-based Mach Zehnder interferometer with 10 km optical fiber to achieve large arm imbalance. An acousto optic modulator is used for interferometer stabilization and heterodyne detection. The out-of-loop frequency noise is reduced by more than 90 dB for Fourier frequency at 1 Hz. This structure presents an efficient laser noise reduction method both at high Fourier frequency and low Fourier frequency. The signal of stabilized laser is transferred via a 10 km fiber link with a fractional frequency stability of 1.12 times 10-16 at 1 s. Compared with the fractional frequency stability of that when the interferometer is not stabilized, more than one order of magnitude is improved. "
"Neutral pion transverse momentum (pT) spectra at mid-rapidity (|y| < 0.35) were measured in Cu+Cu collisions at \sqrt s_NN = 22.4, 62.4, and 200 GeV. Relative to pi -zero yields in p+p collisions scaled by the number of inelastic nucleon-nucleon collisions (Ncoll) at the respective energies, the pi-zero yields for pT \ge 2 GeV/c in central Cu+Cu collisions at 62.4 and 200 GeV are suppressed, whereas an enhancement is observed at 22.4 GeV. A comparison with a jet quenching model suggests that final state parton energy loss dominates in central Cu+Cu collisions at 62.4 GeV and 200 GeV, while the enhancement at 22.4 GeV is consistent with nuclear modifications in the initial state alone. "
"We note that the emerging features of lepton mixing can be reproduced if, with inverted neutrino mass ordering, both the smallest neutrino mass and the $\tau\tau$ element of the neutrino mass matrix vanish. Then, the atmospheric neutrino mixing angle is less than maximal and the Dirac phase $\delta$ is close to $\pi$. We derive the correlations among the mixing parameters and show that there is a large cancellation in the effective mass responsible for neutrinoless $\beta\beta$ decay. Three simple seesaw models leading to our scenario are provided. "
"This article surveys some recent work of the author on Hilbert modular fourfolds X. After some preliminaries on the cohomology and special, codimension 2 cycles Z on X of Hirzebruch-Zagier type, a proof of the Tate conjecture for X over abelian fields is exposed. It is followed by a description of a method to construct classes in the Bloch's Chow group CH^3(X,1) by using Hecke translates of the cycles Z as above with suitable intersections in translates of modular curves. The article ends with the introduction of a modular Gersten complex for a general Shimura variety X and the corresponding groups CH^p_{mod}(X) and CH^p_{mod}(X,1). "
"The fundamental solution of a variant of the three-dimensional wave equation known as ""unidirectional pulse propagation equation"" (UPPE) and its paraxial approximation is obtained. It is shown that the fundamental solution can be presented as a projection of a fundamental solution of the wave equation to some functional subspace. We discuss the degree of equivalence of the UPPE and the wave equation in this respect. In particular, we show that the UPPE, in contrast to the common belief, describes wave propagation in both longitudinal and temporal directions, and, thereby, its fundamental solution possesses a non-causal character.

"The J-Ks color distribution (CD) with a bin size of 0.05 magnitude for the entire Milky Way has been carried out by using the Two Micron All Sky Survey Point Source Catalog (2MASS PSC). The CDs are bimodal, which has a red peak at 0.8 < J-Ks < 0.85 and a blue peak at 0.3 < J-Ks < 0.4. The colors of the red peak are more or less the same for the whole sky, but that of the blue peak depend on Galactic latitude, (J-Ks ~ 0.35 at low Galactic latitudes and 0.35 < J-Ks < 0.4 for other sky areas). The blue peak dominates the bimodal CDs at low Galactic latitudes and becomes comparable with the red peak in other sky regions. In order to explain the bimodal distribution and the global trend shown by the all sky 2MASS CDs, we assemble an empirical HR diagram, which is composed by observational-based near infrared HR diagrams and color magnitude diagrams, and incorporate a Milky Way model. In the empirical HR diagram, the main sequence stars turnoff the thin disk is relatively bluer, (J-Ks)0 = 0.31, when we compare with the thick disk which is (J-Ks)0 = 0.39. The age of the thin/thick disk is roughly estimated to be around 4-5/8-9 Gyr according to the color-age relation of the main sequence turnoff. In general, the 2MASS CDs can be treated as a tool to census the age of stellar population of the Milky Way in a statistical manner and to our knowledge this is a first attempt to measure the age. "
"The astronomer E.V. Pitjeva, by analyzing with the EPM2008 ephemerides a large number of planetary observations including also two years (2004-2006) of normal points from the Cassini spacecraft, phenomenologically estimated a statistically significant non-zero correction to the usual Newtonian/Einsteinian secular precession of the longitude of the perihelion of Saturn, i.e. \Delta\dot\varpi_Sat = -0.006 +/- 0.002 arcsec/cy; the formal, statistical error is 0.0007 arcsec/cy. It can be explained neither by any of the standard classical and general relativistic dynamical effects mismodelled/unmodelled in the force models of the EPM2008 ephemerides nor by several exotic modifications of gravity recently put forth to accommodate certain cosmological/astrophysical observations without resorting to dark energy/dark matter. Both independent analyses by other teams of astronomers and further processing of larger data sets from Cassini will be helpful in clarifying the nature and the true existence of the anomalous precession of the perihelion of Saturn.

"Using JAVA for process control requires the access to I/O-Hardware. This problem is addressed in several ongoing standardisation efforts for Real Time Java. A spin-off of these standardisation efforts is the Siemens product JFPC (Java for Process Control), which is based on the ideas of OPC (OLE for Process Control). It is available under the proprietary RT kernel RMOS and under Windows NT. Based on a contract with Siemens, ZEL - the central electronics facility of Forschungszentrum Juelich - has implemented JFPC under Linux. Additionally, several JFPC providers, e.g for accessing industrial components via PROFIBUS DP have been implemented. "
"The effective interaction between spherical colloids in nematic liquid crystals is investigated in the framework of the Landau-de Gennes theory. The colloids differ through their interaction with the nematic. While both particles induce quadrupolar far-field distortions in the nematic matrix, with unlike quadrupole moments, one favours homeotropic and the other degenerate planar anchoring of the nematic director. In the strong anchoring regime the colloids with homeotropic anchoring are accompanied by an equatorial disclination line defect, known as ""Saturn-ring"", while the colloids with degenerate planar anchoring nucleate a pair of antipodal surface defects, called ""Boojums"". In the linear (large-distance) regime the colloidal interactions are of the quadrupolar type, where the quadrupoles have opposite signs. These are attractive when the colloids are aligned either parallel or perpendicular to the far-field director. At short distance, non-linear effects including ""direct"" interactions between defects give rise to a repulsion between the particles, which prevents them from touching. This finding supports the stability of nematic colloidal square crystallites the assembly of which has been reported recently. "
"The optimal resource allocation scheme in a full-duplex Wireless Powered Communication Network (WPCN) composed of one Access Point (AP) and two wireless devices is analyzed and derived. AP operates in a full-duplex mode and is able to broadcast wireless energy signals in downlink and receive information data in uplink simultaneously. On the other hand, each wireless device is assumed to be equipped with Radio-Frequency (RF) energy harvesting circuitry which gathers the energy sent by AP and stores it in a finite capacity battery. The harvested energy is then used for performing uplink data transmission tasks. In the literature, the main focus so far has been on slot-oriented optimization. In this context, all the harvested RF energy in a given slot is also consumed in the same slot. However, this approach leads to sub-optimal solutions because it does not take into account the Channel State Information (CSI) variations over future slots. Differently from most of the prior works, in this paper we focus on the long-term weighted throughput maximization problem. This approach significantly increases the complexity of the optimization problem since it requires to consider both CSI variations over future slots and the evolution of the batteries when deciding the optimal resource allocation. We formulate the problem using the Markov Decision Process (MDP) theory and show how to solve it. Our numerical results emphasize the superiority of our proposed full-duplex WPCN compared to the half-duplex WPCN and reveal interesting insights about the effects of perfect as well as imperfect self-interference cancellation techniques on the network performance.

"We introduce a class of unitarily invariant, locally $\|\cdot\|_1$-dominating, mutually continuous norms with repect to $\tau$ on a von Neumann algebra $\mathcal{M}$ with a faithful, normal, semifinite tracial weight $\tau$. We prove a Beurling-Chen-Hadwin-Shen theorem for $H^\infty$-invariant spaces of $L^\alpha(\mathcal{M},\tau)$, where $\alpha$ is a unitarily invariant, locally $\|\cdot\|_1$-dominating, mutually continuous norm with respect to $\tau$, and $H^\infty$ is an extension of Arveson's noncommutative Hardy space. We use our main result to characterize the $H^\infty$-invariant subspaces of a noncommutative Banach function space $\mathcal I(\tau)$ with the norm $\|\cdot\|_{E }$ on $\mathcal{M}$, the crossed product of a semifinite von Neumann algebra by an action $\beta$, and $B(\mathcal{H})$ for a separable Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}$.

"We study the number of solutions of the asymptotic Plateau problem in H^3. By using the analytical results in our previous paper, and some topological arguments, we show that there exists an open dense subset of C^3 Jordan curves in S^2_{infty}(H^3) such that any curve in this set bounds a unique least area plane in H^3.

"Light induced current in two-dimensional (2D) layered materials emerges from mechanisms such as photothermoelectric effect, photovoltaic effect or nonlocal hot carrier transport. Semiconducting layered transition metal dichalcogenides have been studied extensively in recent years as the generation of current by light is a crucial process in optoelectronic and photovoltaic devices. However, photocurrent generation is unexpected in metallic 2D layered materials unless a photothermal mechanism is prevalent. Typically, high thermal conductivity and low absorption of the visible spectrum prevent photothermal current generation in metals. Here, we report photoresponse from two-terminal devices of mechanically exfoliated metallic 3R-NbS$_2$ thin crystals using scanning photocurrent microscopy (SPCM) both at zero and finite bias. SPCM measurements reveal that the photocurrent predominantly emerges from metal/NbS$_2$ junctions of the two-terminal device at zero bias. At finite biases, along with the photocurrent generated at metal/NbS$_2$ junctions, now a negative photoresponse from all over the NbS$_2$ crystal is evident. Among our results, we realized that the observed photocurrent can be explained by the local heating caused by the laser excitation. These findings show that NbS$_2$ is among a few metallic materials in which photocurrent generation is possible. "
"In a magnetization vs. temperature (M vs. T) experiment, the blocking region of a magnetic nanoparticle (MNP) assembly is the interval of T values were the system begins to respond to an applied magnetic field H when heating the sample from the lower reachable temperature. The location of this region is determined by the anisotropy energy barrier depending on the applied field H, the volume V, the magnetic anisotropy constant K of the MNPs and the observing time of the technique. In the general case of a polysized sample, a representative blocking temperature value $T_B$ can be estimated from ZFC-FC experiments as a way to determine the effective anisotropy constant. In this work, a numerical solved Stoner-Wolfharth two level model with thermal agitation is used to simulate ZFC-FC curves of monosized and polysized samples and to determine the best method for obtaining a representative $T_B$ value of polysized samples. The results corroborate a technique based on the T derivative of the difference between ZFC and FC curves proposed by Micha et al(the good) and demonstrate its relation with two alternative methods: the ZFC maximum (the bad) and inflection point (the ugly). The derivative method is then applied to experimental data, obtaining the $T_B$ distribution of a polysized $Fe_3O_4$ MNP sample suspended in hexane with an excellent agreement with TEM characterization.

"We investigate in detail the magnetic cause of minifilament eruptions that drive coronal-hole jets. We study 13 random on-disk coronal hole jet eruptions, using high resolution X-ray images from Hinode/XRT, EUV images from SDO/AIA, and magnetograms from SDO/HMI. For all 13 events, we track the evolution of the jet-base region and find that a minifilament of cool (transition-region-temperature) plasma is present prior to each jet eruption. HMI magnetograms show that the minifilaments reside along a magnetic neutral line between majority-polarity and minority-polarity magnetic flux patches. These patches converge and cancel with each other, with an average cancelation rate of ~0.6 X 10$^18 Mx hr^{-1} for all 13 jets. Persistent flux cancelation at the neutral line eventually destabilizes the minifilament field, which erupts outward and produces the jet spire. Thus, we find that all 13 coronal-hole-jet-driving minifilament eruptions are triggered by flux cancelation at the neutral line. These results are in agreement with our recent findings Panesar et al 2016b for quiet-region jets, where flux cancelation at the underlying neutral line triggers the minifilament eruption that drives each jet. Thus from that study of quiet-Sun jets and this study of coronal hole jets, we conclude that flux cancelation is the main candidate for triggering quiet region and coronal hole jets "
"We present the results of long-baseline optical interferometry observations using the Precision Astronomical Visual Observations (PAVO) beam combiner at the Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy (CHARA) Array to measure the angular sizes of three bright Kepler stars: {\theta} Cygni, and both components of the binary system 16 Cygni. Supporting infrared observations were made with the Michigan Infrared Combiner (MIRC) and Classic beam combiner, also at the CHARA Array. We find limb-darkened angular diameters of 0.753+/-0.009 mas for {\theta} Cyg, 0.539+/-0.007 mas for 16 Cyg A and 0.490+/-0.006 mas for 16 Cyg B. The Kepler Mission has observed these stars with outstanding photometric precision, revealing the presence of solar-like oscillations. Due to the brightness of these stars the oscillations have exceptional signal-to-noise, allowing for detailed study through asteroseismology, and are well constrained by other observations. We have combined our interferometric diameters with Hipparcos parallaxes, spectrophotometric bolometric fluxes and the asteroseismic large frequency separation to measure linear radii ({\theta} Cyg: 1.48+/-0.02 Rsun, 16 Cyg A: 1.22+/-0.02 Rsun, 16 Cyg B: 1.12+/-0.02 Rsun), effective temperatures ({\theta} Cyg: 6749+/-44 K, 16 Cyg A: 5839+/-42 K, 16 Cyg B: 5809+/-39 K), and masses ({\theta} Cyg: 1.37+/-0.04 Msun, 16 Cyg A: 1.07+/-0.05 Msun, 16 Cyg B: 1.05+/-0.04 Msun) for each star with very little model dependence. The measurements presented here will provide strong constraints for future stellar modelling efforts. "

"In this paper we define multiple Dedekind zeta values (MDZV), using a new type of iterated integrals, called iterated integrals on a membrane. One should consider MDZV as a number theoretic generalization of Euler's multiple zeta values. Over imaginary quadratic fields MDZV capture, in particular, multiple Eisenstein series (Gangl, Kaneko and Zagier). We give an analogue of multiple Eisenstein series over real quadratic field and an alternative definition of values of multiple Eisenstein-Kronecker series (Goncharov). Each of them is a special case of multiple Dedekind zeta values. MDZV are interpolated into functions that we call multiple Dedekind zeta functions (MDZF). We show that MDZF have integral representation, can be written as infinite sum, and have analytic continuation. We compute explicitly the value of a multiple residue of certain MDZF over a quadratic number field at the point (1,1,1,1). Based on such computations, we state two conjectures about MDZV. "
"We propose a new method to obtain kinetic properties of infrequent events from molecular dynamics simulation. The procedure employs a recently introduced variational approach [Valsson and Parrinello, Phys. Rev. Lett. 113, 090601 (2014)] to construct a bias potential as a function of several collective variables that is designed to flood only the associated free energy surface up to a predefined level. The resulting bias potential effectively accelerates transitions between metastable free energy minima while ensuring bias-free transition states, thus allowing accurate kinetic rates to be obtained. We test the method on a few illustrative systems for which we obtain an order of magnitude improvement in efficiency relative to previous approaches, and several orders of magnitude relative to unbiased molecular dynamics. We expect an even larger improvement in more complex systems. This and the ability of the variational approach to deal efficiently with a large number of collective variables will greatly enhance the scope of these calculations. This work is a vindication of the potential that the variational principle has if applied in innovative ways "
"Circularly polarized gravitational sandwich waves exhibit, as do their linearly polarized counterparts, the Velocity Memory Effect: freely falling test particles in the flat after-zone fly apart along straight lines with constant velocity. In the inside zone their trajectories combine oscillatory and rotational motions in a complicated way. For circularly polarized periodic gravitational waves some trajectories remain bounded, while others spiral outward. These waves admit an additional ""screw"" isometry beyond the usual five. The consequences of this extra symmetry are explored. "
"We construct (hybrid) baryons in the flux-tube model of Isgur and Paton. In the limit of adiabatic quark motion, we build proper eigenstates of orbital angular momentum and indicate the flavour, spin, chirality and J^P of (hybrid) baryons. The adiabatic potential is calculated as a function of the quark positions. "
"We argue that the asymmetric morphology of the blue and red shifted components of the outflow at hundreds of AU from the massive binary system Eta Carinae can be understood from the collision of the primary stellar wind with the slowly expanding dense equatorial gas. Recent high spatial observations of some forbidden lines, e.g. [Fe III] lambda4659, reveal the outflowing gas within about one arcsecond (2300 AU) from Eta Car. The distribution of the blue and red shifted components are not symmetric about the center, and they are quite different from each other. The morphologies of the blue and red shifted components correlate with the location of dense slowly moving equatorial gas (termed the Weigelt blob environment; WBE), that is thought to have been ejected during the 1887 - 1895 Lesser Eruption. In our model the division to the blue and red shifted components is caused by the postshock flow of the primary wind on the two sides of the equatorial plane after it collides with the WBE. The fast wind from the secondary star plays no role in our model for these components, and it is the freely expanding primary wind that collides with the WBE. Because the line of sight is inclined to the binary axis, the two components are not symmetric. We show that the postshock gas can also account for the observed intensity in the [Fe III] lambda4659 line. "
"We study the resonant tunneling effect in a many-body Wannier-Stark system, realized by ultracold bosonic atoms in an optical lattice subjected to an external Stark force. The properties of the many-body system are effectively described in terms of upper-band excitation manifolds, which allow for the study of the transition between regular and quantum chaotic spectral statistics. We show that our system makes it possible to control the spectral statistics locally in energy space by the competition of the force and the interparticle interaction. By a time-dependent sweep of the Stark force the dynamics is reduced to a Landau-Zener problem in the single-particle setting. "
"We consider two possible sources of the $T$-violating muon transverse polarization in the process $K^+ \to \mu^+ \nu \gamma$: electromagnetic final state interaction in the SM and contribution due to charged-Higgs exchange diagrams in the framework of the Weinberg three doublets model. It is shown that at the one-loop level of the SM the muon transverse polarization, $P_T^{SM}$, varies within $(0.0 \div 1.1 \cdot 10^{-3})$ in the Dalitz plot region. Averaged value of the muon polarization, $<P^{SM}_T>$, in the kinematic region of $E_\gamma \geq 20$ MeV is equal to $4.76\cdot 10^{-4}$. In the case of the model with three Higgs doublets the muon transverse polarization is calculated as a function of charged Higgs masses, imaginary part of the Yukawa coupling constants product and vacuum expectation values of the Higgs doublets. The averaged value of the transverse polarization in the Weinberg model is $<P^{Higgs}_T > = - 6.62 \cdot 10^{-5}$. Perspectives to probe the effect caused by the charged Higgs exchange diagrams in planned kaon experiments are discussed. "
"The determination of the pattern of hadronic resonances as predicted by Quantum Chromodynamics requires the use of non-perturbative techniques. Lattice QCD has emerged as the dominant tool for such calculations, and has produced many QCD predictions which can be directly compared to experiment. The concepts underlying lattice QCD are outlined, methods for calculating excited states are discussed, and results from an exploratory Nucleon and Delta baryon spectrum study are presented. "
"Why Bi2Sr2CaCu2Ox (Bi2212) allows high critical current density Jc in round wires rather than only in the anisotropic tape form demanded by all other high temperature superconductors is important for future magnet applications. Here we compare the local texture of state-of-the-art Bi2212 and Bi2223 ((Bi,Pb)2Sr2Ca2Cu3O10), finding that round wire Bi2212 generates a dominant a-axis growth texture that also enforces a local biaxial texture (FWHM <15{\deg}) while simultaneously allowing the c-axes of its polycrystals to rotate azimuthally along and about the filament axis so as to generate macroscopically isotropic behavior. By contrast Bi2223 shows only a uniaxial (FWHM <15{\deg}) c-axis texture perpendicular to the tape plane without any in-plane texture. Consistent with these observations, a marked, field-increasing, field-decreasing Jc(H) hysteresis characteristic of weak-linked systems appears in Bi2223 but is absent in Bi2212 round wire. Growth-induced texture on cooling from the melt step of the Bi2212 Jc optimization process appears to be the key step in generating this highly desirable microstructure. "
"This paper presents intuitive interpretations of tightly focused beams of light by drawing analogies to two-dimensional electrostatics, magnetostatics and fluid dynamics. We use a Helmholtz decomposition of the transverse polarization components in the transverse plane to introduce generalized radial and azimuthal polarization states. This reveals the interplay between transverse and longitudinal polarization components in a transparent fashion. Our approach yields a comprehensive understanding of tightly focused laser beams, which we illustrate through several insightful examples. "
"The ALICE detector, expected to start operating at the Large Hadron Collider this year, was designed specifically for the study of heavy-ion collisions. In this paper we recall the main features of the apparatus and give some examples of the expected physics performance. "
"We present a rigorous and functorial quantization scheme for affine field theories, i.e., field theories where local spaces of solutions are affine spaces. The target framework for the quantization is the general boundary formulation, allowing to implement manifest locality without the necessity for metric or causal background structures. The quantization combines the holomorphic version of geometric quantization for state spaces with the Feynman path integral quantization for amplitudes. We also develop an adapted notion of coherent states, discuss vacuum states, and consider observables and their Berezin-Toeplitz quantization. Moreover, we derive a factorization identity for the amplitude in the special case of a linear field theory modified by a source-like term and comment on its use as a generating functional for a generalized S-matrix. "
"Motivated by the recent discoveries of binary black-hole mergers by the Advanced Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (Advanced LIGO), we investigate the prospects of ground-based detectors to perform a spectroscopic analysis of signals emitted during the ringdown of the final Kerr black-hole formed by a stellar mass binary black-hole merger. If we assume an optimistic rate of 240 Gpc$^{-3}$yr$^{-1}$, about 3 events per year can be measured by Advanced LIGO. Further, upgrades to the existing LIGO detectors will increase the odds of measuring multiple ringdown modes significantly. New ground-based facilities such as Einstein Telescope or Cosmic Explorer could measure multiple ringdown modes in about thousand events per year. We perform Monte-Carlo injections of $10^{6}$ binary black-hole mergers in a search volume defined by a sphere of radius 1500 Mpc centered at the detector, for various proposed ground-based detector models. We assume a uniform random distribution in component masses of the progenitor binaries, sky positions and orientations to investigate the fraction of the population that satisfy our criteria for detectability and resolvability of multiple ringdown modes. We investigate the detectability and resolvability of the sub-dominant modes $l=m=3$, $l=m=4$ and $l=2, m=1$. Our results indicate that the modes with $l=m=3$ and $l=2, m=1$ are the most promising candidates for sub-dominant mode measurability. We find that for stellar mass black-hole mergers, resolvability is not a limiting criteria for these modes. We emphasize that the measurability of the $l=2, m=1$ mode is not impeded by the resolvability criterion. "
"We show that the rotating generalization of Hayward's non-singular black hole previously studied in the literature is geodesically incomplete, and that its straightforward extension leads to a singular spacetime. We present another extension, which is devoid of any curvature singularity. The obtained metric depends on three parameters and, depending on their values, yields an event horizon or not. These two regimes, named respectively regular rotating Hayward black hole and naked rotating wormhole, are studied both numerically and analytically. In preparation for the upcoming results of the Event Horizon Telescope, the images of an accretion torus around Sgr A*, the supermassive object at the center of the Galaxy, are computed. These images contain, even in the absence of a horizon, a central faint region which bears a resemblance to the shadow of Kerr black holes and emphasizes the difficulty of claiming the existence of an event horizon from the analysis of strong-field images. The frequencies of the co- and contra-rotating orbits at the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) in this geometry are also computed, in the hope that quasi-periodic oscillations may permit to compare this model with Kerr's black hole on observational grounds. "
"Recently, Thornton et al. reported the detection of four fast radio bursts (FRBs). The dispersion measures indicate that the sources of these FRBs are at cosmological distance. Given the large full sky event rate ~ 10^4 sky^-1 day^-1, the FRBs are a promising target for multi-messenger astronomy. Here we propose double degenerate, binary white-dwarf (WD) mergers as the source of FRBs, which are produced by coherent emission from the polar region of a rapidly rotating, magnetized massive WD formed after the merger. The basic characteristics of the FRBs, such as the energetics, emission duration and event rate, can be consistently explained in this scenario. As a result, we predict that some FRBs can accompany type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) or X-ray debris disks. Simultaneous detection could test our scenario and probe the progenitors of SNe Ia, and moreover would provide a novel constraint on the cosmological parameters. We strongly encourage future SN and X-ray surveys that follow up FRBs. "
"In this paper, we show that the presence of nonlinear coupling between time series may be detected employing kernel feature space representations alone dispensing with the need to go back to solve the pre-image problem to gauge model adequacy. As a consequence, the canonical methodology for model construction, diagnostics, and Granger connectivity inference applies with no change other than computation using kernels in lieu of second-order moments. "
"Quantum algorithms are usually described as monolithic circuits, becoming large at modest input size. Near-term quantum architectures can only manage a small number of qubits. We develop an automated method to distribute quantum circuits over multiple agents, minimising quantum communication between them. We reduce the problem to hypergraph partitioning and then solve it with state-of-the-art optimisers. This makes our approach useful in practice, unlike previous methods. Our implementation is evaluated on five quantum circuits of practical relevance. "
"Fringing field has to be taken into account in the formulation of electrostatic parallel-plate actuators when the gap separating the electrodes is comparable to the geometrical dimensions of the moving plate. Even in this case, the existing formulations often result in complicated mathematical models from which it is difficult to determine the deflection of the moving plate for given voltages and therefore to predict the necessary applied voltages for actuation control. This work presents a new method for the modeling of fringing field, in which the effect of fringing field is modeled as a serial capacitor. Numerical simulation demonstrates the suitability of this formulation. Based on this model, a robust control scheme is constructed using the theory of input-to-state stabilization (ISS) and back-stepping state feedback design. The stability and the performance of the system using this control scheme are demonstrated through both stability analysis and numerical simulation. "
"The present study deals with LRS Bianchi type I cosmological model representing massive string. The energy-momentum tensor for such string as formulated by Letelier (1983) is used to construct massive string cosmological models for which we assume that the shear scalar ($\sigma$) is proportional to the expansion scalar ($\theta$). The study reveals that massive strings dominate the early Universe. The strings eventually disappear from the Universe for sufficiently large time, which is in agreement with the current astronomical observations. Some physical and geometrical behaviour of models are also discussed. "
"We present an analysis of structural features of all known galaxies with optical polar rings. We find a clear dichotomy for objects of this peculiar class. Bulge-dominated S0 galaxies possess only short narrow rings, while disk-dominated objects always have wide extended polar rings. We try by gas dynamical simulations to explain such a segregation by dependence of the ring-forming process on different galaxy potentials. It is found that the total mass captured into the ring during an encounter of a host-ring system with a gas-rich spiral galaxy of comparable mass exceeds 10^9 M_{\odot} (or about 10% of all gas in the donor galaxy), which is of the order of that found by observation. The process of gas to gather into a steady-state ring takes approximately (7 - 9) x 10^8 years. This time is somewhat shorter for rings forming around bulge-dominated galaxies. We also present observational arguments for S0 galaxies with extended rings to be similar to late-type spirals by their photometric properties, while numerical modelling of the extended ring formation suggests that these galaxies must possess massive dark halos as well. In this case, the sizes of the modelled rings turn out large enough (up to 30 kpc in diameter), and the time scale for ring formation is prolonged up to several Gyrs. "
"Semiclassical systems being symmetric under Lie group are studied. A state of a semiclassical system may be viewed as a set (X,f) of a classical state X and a quantum state f in the external classical background X. Therefore, the set of all semiclassical states may be considered as a bundle (""semiclassical bundle""). Its base {X} is the set of all classical states, while a fibre is a Hilbert space of quantum states in the external background X. Symmetry transformation of a semiclassical system may be viewed as an automorphism of the semiclassical bundle. Automorphism groups can be investigated with the help of sections of the bundle: to any automorphism of the bundle one assigns a transformation of section of the bundle. Infinitesimal properties of transformations of sections are investigated; correspondence between Lie groups and Lie algebras is discussed. For gauge theories, some points of the semiclassical bundle are identified: a gauge group acts on the bundle. For this case, only gauge-invariant sections of the semiclassical bundle are taken into account. "
"Kepler is a NASA mission designed to detect exoplanets and characterize the properties of exoplanetary systems. Kepler also includes an asteroseismic programme which is being conducted through the Kepler Asteroseismic Science Consortium (KASC), whose 400 members are organized into 13 working groups by type of variable star. So far data have been available from the first 7 month of the mission containing a total of 2937 targets observed at a 1-min. cadence for periods between 10 days and 7 months. The goals of the asteroseismic part of the Kepler project is to perform detailed studies of stellar interiors. The first results of the asteroseismic analysis are orders of magnitude better than seen before, and this bodes well for how the future analysis of Kepler data for many types of stars will impact our general understanding of stellar structure and evolution. "
"We have decomposed to symmetric and asymmetric modes the mass-TKE fission fragment distributions calculated by 4-dimensional Langevin approach and observed how the dominant fission mode and symmetric mode change as functions of $Z^2/\sqrt[3]{A}$ of the fissioning system in the actinides and trans-actinide region. As a result, we found that the symmetric mode makes a sudden transition from super-long to super short fission mode around $^{254}$Es. The dominant fission modes on the other hand, are persistently asymmetric except for $^{258}$Fm, $^{259}$Fm and $^{260}$Md when the dominant fission mode suddenly becomes symmetric although it returns to the asymmetric mode around $^{256}$No. These correlated ""twin transitions"" have been known empirically by Darleane Hoffman and her group back in 1989, but for the first time we have given a clear explanation in terms of a dynamical model of nuclear fission. More specifically, since we kept the shape model parameters unchanged over the entire mass region, we conclude that the correlated twin transition emerge naturally from the dynamics in 4-D potential energy surface. "
"With a simple model from the point of view of population synthesis we try to verify an interesting suggestion made by Pfahl & Rappaport (2001) that dim sources in globular clusters (GCs) can be isolated accreting neutron stars (NSs). Simple estimates show, that we can expect about 0.5-1 accreting isolated NS per typical GC with $M=10^5 M_{\odot}$ in correspondence with observations. Properties of old accreting isolated NSs in GCs are briefly discussed. We suggest that accreting NSs in GCs experienced significant magnetic field decay. "
"We investigate the behavior of persistent currents for a fixed number of noninteracting fermions in a periodic quantum ladder threaded by Aharonov-Bohm and transverse magnetic fluxes $\Phi$ and $\chi$. We show that the coupling between ladder legs provides a way to effectively change the ground-state fermion-number parity, by varying $\chi$. Specifically, we demonstrate that varying $\chi$ by $2\pi$ (one flux quantum) leads to an apparent fermion-number parity switch. We find that persistent currents exhibit a robust $4\pi$ periodicity as a function of $\chi$, despite the fact that $\chi \to \chi + 2\pi$ leads to modifications of order $1/N$ of the energy spectrum, where $N$ is the number of sites in each ladder leg. We show that these parity-switch and $4\pi$ periodicity effects are robust with respect to temperature and disorder, and outline potential physical realizations using cold atomic gases and, for bosonic analogs of the effects, photonic lattices. "
The wire method is a more rapid and less costly method to measure impedances of RF components compared to methods using a beam. A setup using a single displaced wire to excite and measure transverse resonant modes in accelerating structures for the Next Linear Collider/ Japanese Linear Collider (NLC/JLC) has been built. The RF signal is coupled into and out of the structure using two matching sections with a broadband frequency from 11 to 18 GHz. Their contribution to the scattering parameter is minimized by a calibration technique. A standing wave structure has been measured. Difficulties in accurately predicting the modal loss factors were encountered related to the approximations made and to experimental issues. The measurements are presented and comparisons with simulations are made.
"With stereoscopic displays, a depth sensation that is too strong could impede visual comfort and result in fatigue or pain. Electroencephalography (EEG) is a technology which records brain activity. We used it to develop a novel brain-computer interface that monitors users' states in order to reduce visual strain. We present the first proof-of-concept system that discriminates comfortable conditions from uncomfortable ones during stereoscopic vision using EEG. It reacts within 1s to depth variations, achieving 63% accuracy on average and 74% when 7 consecutive variations are measured. This study could lead to adaptive systems that automatically suit stereoscopic displays to users and viewing conditions. "
"We present a spectral analysis of three simultaneous NuSTAR and Swift/XRT observations of the transient Be-neutron star binary KS 1947+300 taken during its outburst in 2013/2014. These broad-band observations were supported by Swift/XRT monitoring snap-shots every 3 days, which we use to study the evolution of the spectrum over the outburst. We find strong changes of the power-law photon index, which shows a weak trend of softening with increasing X-ray flux. The neutron star shows very strong pulsations with a period of P ~ 18.8 s. The 0.8-79 keV broad-band spectrum can be described by a power-law with an exponential cutoff and a black-body component at low energies. During the second observation we detect a cyclotron resonant scattering feature at 12.5 keV, which is absent in the phase-averaged spectra of observations 1 and 3. Pulse phase-resolved spectroscopy reveals that the strength of the feature changes strongly with pulse phase and is most prominent during the broad minimum of the pulse profile. At the same phases the line also becomes visible in the first and third observation at the same energy. This discovery implies that KS 1947+300 has a magnetic field strength of B ~ 1.1e12 (1+z)G, which is at the lower end of known cyclotron line sources. "
"In order to complete tasks in a new environment, robots must be able to recognize unseen, unique objects. Fully supervised methods have made great strides on the object segmentation task, but require many examples of each object class and don't scale to unseen environments. In this work, we present a method that acquires pixelwise object labels for manipulable in-hand objects with no human supervision. Our two-step approach does a foreground-background segmentation informed by robot kinematics then uses a self-recognition network to segment the robot from the object in the foreground. We are able to achieve 49.4% mIoU performance on a difficult and varied assortment of items. "
"Charge fluctuations as a possible signal of quark - gluon plasma (QGP) were recently suggested. A short summary of comments presented on this subject is given and supplemented by a discussion of the coexistence of pions produced ""directly"" and through a QGP phase. Such a coexistence may obscure the expected plasma signal similarly to the effects considered in the comments mentioned above. "
"We explore the relationship between gas and dust in massive star-forming regions by comparing physical properties derived from each. We compare the temperatures and column densities in a massive star-forming Infrared Dark Cloud (IRDC, G32.02+0.05), which shows a range of evolutionary states, from quiescent to active. The gas properties were derived using radiative transfer modeling of the (1,1), (2,2), and (4,4) transitions of NH3 on the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA), while the dust temperatures and column densities were calculated using cirrus-subtracted, modified blackbody fits to Herschel data. We compare the derived column densities to calculate an NH3 abundance, 4.6 x 10^-8. In the coldest star-forming region, we find that the measured dust temperatures are lower than the measured gas temperatures (mean and standard deviations T_dust ~ 11.6 +/- 0.2 K vs. T_gas ~ 15.2 +/- 1.5 K), which may indicate that the gas and dust are not well-coupled in the youngest regions (~0.5 Myr) or that these observations probe a regime where the dust and/or gas temperature measurements are unreliable. Finally, we calculate millimeter fluxes based on the temperatures and column densities derived from NH3 which suggest that millimeter dust continuum observations of massive star-forming regions, such as the Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey or ATLASGAL, can probe hot cores, cold cores, and the dense gas lanes from which they form, and are generally not dominated by the hottest core. "
"In this work, we study charged current quasi elastic scattering of muon anti-neutrino off nucleon and nucleus using a formalism based on Llewellyn Smith (LS) model. Parameterizations by Galster et al. are used for electric and magnetic Sach's form factors of nucleons. We use Fermi gas model along with Pauli suppression condition to take into account the nuclear effects in anti-neutrino - nucleus QES. We calculate muon anti-neutrino-p and muon anti-neutrino-^{12}C charged current quasi elastic scattering differential and total cross sections for different values of axial mass M_{A} and compare the results with data from GGM, SKAT, BNL, NOMAD, MINERvA and MiniBooNE experiments. The present theoretical approach gives an excellent description of differential cross section data. The calculations with axial mass M_{A} = 0.979 and 1.05 GeV are compatible with data from most of the experiments. "
"In situations where the sampling units in a study can be more easily ranked based on the measurement of an auxiliary variable, ranked set sampling provide unbiased estimators for the mean of a population that they are more efficient than unbiased estimator based on simple random sample. In this paper, we consider the Morgenstern type bivariate generalized exponential distribution (MTBGED) and obtain several unbiased estimators for a parameter mean of the marginal distribution of MTBGED based on different ranked set sampling schemes. The efficiency of all considered estimators are evaluate and has also been demonstrated with numerical illustrations. "
"The appearance of the big bounce (BB) in the evolution of the universe is analyzed in the setting of loop quantum cosmology (LQC). Making use of an idea of a minimum length turns classical Big Bang into BB. We argue why the spectrum of the kinematical area operator of loop quantum gravity cannot be used for the determination of this length. We find that the fundamental length, at the present stage of development of LQC, is a free parameter of this model. "
"In this paper, we propose to infer music genre embeddings from audio datasets carrying semantic information about genres. We show that such embeddings can be used for disambiguating genre tags (identification of different labels for the same genre, tag translation from a tag system to another, inference of hierarchical taxonomies on these genre tags). These embeddings are built by training a deep convolutional neural network genre classifier with large audio datasets annotated with a flat tag system. We show empirically that they makes it possible to retrieve the original taxonomy of a tag system, spot duplicates tags and translate tags from a tag system to another. "
"We present the on-going observational program of a VIMOS Integral Field Unit survey of the central regions of massive, gravitational lensing galaxy clusters at redshift z~0.2. We have observed six clusters using the low-resolution blue grism (R about 200), and the spectroscopic survey is complemented by a wealth of photometric data, including Hubble Space Telescope optical data and near infrared VLT data. The principal scientific aims of this project are: the study of the high-z lensed galaxies, the transformation and evolution of galaxies in cluster cores and the use of multiple images to constrain cosmography. We briefly report here on the first results from this project on the clusters Abell 2667 and Abell 68. "
"Graphs are typically visualized as node-link diagrams. Although there is a fair amount of research focusing on crossing minimization to improve readability, little attention has been paid on how to handle crossings when they are an essential part of the final visualizations. This requires us to understand how people read graphs and how crossings affect reading performance. As an initial step to this end, a preliminary eye tracking experiment was conducted. The specific purpose of this experiment was to test the effects of crossing angles and geometric-path tendency on eye movements and performance. Sixteen subjects performed both path search and node locating tasks with six drawings. The results showed that small angles can slow down and trigger extra eye movements, causing delays for path search tasks, whereas crossings have little impact on node locating tasks. Geometric-path tendency indicates that a path between two nodes can become harder to follow when many branches of the path go toward the target node. The insights obtained are discussed with a view to further confirmation in future work. "
"We study some equivalent properties of the curvature-dimension conditions $CD(n,K)$ inequality on infinite, but locally finite graph. These equivalences are gradient estimate, Poincar\'e type inequalities and reverse Poincar\'e inequalities. And we also obtain one equivalent property of gradient estimate for a new notion of curvature-dimension conditions $CDE'(\infty, K)$ at the same assumption of graphs. "
"Recently the low-energy effective string theory has been used by Gasperini and Veneziano to elaborate a very interesting scenario for the early history of the universe (``birth of the universe as quantum scattering''). Here we investigate the gauge fixing and the problem of the definition of a global time parameter for this model, and we obtain the positive norm Hilbert space of states. "
"The present article is devoted to the study of transfers for $A_\infty$ structures, their maps and homotopies, as developed in \cite{Markl06}. In particular, we supply the proofs of claims formulated therein and provide their extension by comparing them with the former approach based on the homological perturbation lemma. "
"The Bogoliubov transformation in thermofield dynamics, an operator formalism for the finite-temperature quantum-field theory, is generalized to describe a field in arbitrary confined regions of space and time. Starting with the scalar field, the approach is extended to the electromagnetic field and the energy-momentum tensor is written via the Bogoliubov transformation. In this context, the Casimir effect is calculated for zero and non-zero temperature, and therefore it can be considered as a vacuum condensation effect of the electromagnetic field. This aspect opens an interesting perspective for using this procedure as an effective scheme for calculations in the studies of confined fields, including the interacting fields. "
"We propose the notion of $E_{2}$-quasi-exact solvability and apply this idea to find explicit solutions to the eigenvalue problem for a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian system depending on two parameters. The model considered reduces to the complex Mathieu Hamiltonian in a double scaling limit, which enables us to compute the exceptional points in the energy spectrum of the latter as a limiting process of the zeros for some algebraic equations. The coefficient functions in the quasi-exact eigenfunctions are univariate polynomials in the energy obeying a three-term recurrence relation. The latter property guarantees the existence of a linear functional such that the polynomials become orthogonal. The polynomials are shown to factorize for all levels above the quantization condition leading to vanishing norms rendering them to be weakly orthogonal. In two concrete examples we compute the explicit expressions for the Stieltjes measure. "
"Debye screening of static chromoelectric fields at high temperature is investigated at next-to-leading order through one-loop resummed perturbation theory. At this order the gluon propagator appears to give rise to strong deviations from a Yukawa form of screening. Generally, an oscillatory behavior is found which asymptotically becomes repulsive, but in a gauge-dependent manner. However, these features are strongly sensitive to the existence of screening of static magnetic fields. It is shown that a small magnetic screening mass can restore exponential screening with a gauge independent value of the screening mass, which depends logarithmically on the magnitude of the magnetic mass. Recent results obtained in temporal axial gauge, which instead indicate an asymptotic (repulsive) power-law behavior of screening, are also critically discussed. In order to arrive at a gauge-invariant treatment of chromoelectric screening, Polyakov loop correlations are considered, both with and without dynamical gauge symmetry breaking. Again a crucial sensitivity to the scale of magnetic screening is found. A detailed comparison of the perturbative results with recent high-precision lattice simulations of the SU(2) Polyakov loop correlator is made, which are found to agree well with the perturbative result in the symmetric phase when a magnetic mass $\sim g^2T/4$ is included. "
"We investigate the standard generalized Gorenstein algebras of homological dimension three, giving a structure theorem for their resolutions. Moreover in many cases we are able to give a complete description of their graded Betti numbers. "
"In this paper, we present a flexible low-rank matrix completion (LRMC) approach for topological interference management (TIM) in the partially connected K-user interference channel. No channel state information (CSI) is required at the transmitters except the network topology information. The previous attempt on the TIM problem is mainly based on its equivalence to the index coding problem, but so far only a few index coding problems have been solved. In contrast, in this paper, we present an algorithmic approach to investigate the achievable degrees-of-freedom (DoFs) by recasting the TIM problem as an LRMC problem. Unfortunately, the resulting LRMC problem is known to be NP-hard, and the main contribution of this paper is to propose a Riemannian pursuit (RP) framework to detect the rank of the matrix to be recovered by iteratively increasing the rank. This algorithm solves a sequence of fixed-rank matrix completion problems. To address the convergence issues in the existing fixed-rank optimization methods, the quotient manifold geometry of the search space of fixed-rank matrices is exploited via Riemannian optimization. By further exploiting the structure of the low-rank matrix varieties, i.e., the closure of the set of fixed- rank matrices, we develop an efficient rank increasing strategy to find good initial points in the procedure of rank pursuit. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed RP algorithm achieves a faster convergence rate and higher achievable DoFs for the TIM problem compared with the state-of-the-art methods. "
"AMANDA is a high-energy neutrino telescope presently under construction at the geographical South Pole. In the Antarctic summer 1995/96, an array of 80 optical modules (OMs) arranged on 4 strings (AMANDA-B4) was deployed at depths between 1.5 and 2 km. In this paper we describe the design and performance of the AMANDA-B4 prototype, based on data collected between February and November 1996. Monte Carlo simulations of the detector response to down-going atmospheric muon tracks show that the global behavior of the detector is understood. We describe the data analysis method and present first results on atmospheric muon reconstruction and separation of neutrino candidates. The AMANDA array was upgraded with 216 OMs on 6 new strings in 1996/97 (AMANDA-B10), and 122 additional OMs on 3 strings in 1997/98. "
"Through an equivalent condition on the Farey series set forth by Franel and Landau, we prove Riemann Hypothesis for the Riemann zeta-function and the Dirichlet L-function. "
"Inspired by previous work in 2+1 dimensional quantum gravity, which found evidence for a discretization of time in the quantum theory, we reexamine the issue for the case of pure Lorentzian gravity with vanishing cosmological constant and spatially compact universes of genus larger than 1. Taking as our starting point the Chern-Simons formulation with Poincare gauge group, we identify a set of length variables corresponding to space- and timelike distances along geodesics in three-dimensional Minkowski space. These are Dirac observables, that is, functions on the reduced phase space, whose quantization is essentially unique. For both space- and timelike distance operators, the spectrum is continuous and not bounded away from zero. "
"Let F_{q^n} be the field of order q^n, and let Tr be the trace map from F_{q^n} to its q-element subfield. We exhibit nine sequences of polynomials of the form f(x):=x+c*Tr(x^k), with c in F_{q^n}, such that for each polynomial the function F_{q^n}-->F_{q^n} given by c-->f(c) is a permutation of F_{q^n}. We also computed all permutation polynomials of this form over finite fields of size less than 5000, and found that our examples comprise all examples with n>1 except for some simple cases where the polynomial induces a homomorphism of the additive group of F_{q^n}, along with a few sporadic examples. One intriguing feature is that our proofs of the different sequences use various different methods, including a new variant of Dobbertin's method among others. "

"Cloud computing is emerging as a revolutionary computing paradigm which pro-vides a flexible and economic strategy for data management and resource sharing. Security and privacy become major concerns in the cloud scenario, for which Searchable Encryption (SE) technology is proposed to support efficient retrieval of encrypted data. However, the absence of lightweight ranked search is still a typical shortage in existing SE schemes. In this paper, we propose a Lightweight Efficient Multi-keyword Ranked Search over Encrypted Cloud Data using Dual Word Embeddings (LRSE) scheme that supports top-k retrieval in the known background model. For the first time, we formulate the privacy issue and design goals for lightweight ranked search in SE. We employ word embedding trained on the whole English Wikipedia using word2vec to replace the general dictionary, afterwards we make use of Dual Embedding Space Model (DESM) to substitute traditional Vector Space Model (VSM), based on which we achieve the goal of lightweight ranked search with higher precision and solve the challenging prob-lems caused by updating the traditional dictionary in existing SE schemes. In LRSE, we employ an improved secure kNN scheme to guarantee sufficient pri-vacy protection. Our security analysis shows that LRSE satisfies our formulated privacy requirements and extensive experiments performed on real-world datasets demonstrate that LRSE indeed accords with our proposed design goals.

"For decades, the detection of phosphorus-bearing molecules in the interstellar medium was restricted to high-mass star-forming regions (as e.g. SgrB2 and Orion KL) and the circumstellar envelopes of evolved stars. However, recent higher-sensitivity observations have revealed that molecules such as PN and PO are present not only toward cold massive cores and low-mass star-forming regions with PO/PN ratios >1, but also toward the Giant Molecular Clouds in the Galactic Center known to be exposed to highly energetic phenomena such as intense UV radiation fields, shock waves and cosmic rays. In this paper, we carry out a comprehensive study of the chemistry of phosphorus-bearing molecules across different astrophysical environments which cover a range of physical conditions (cold molecular dark clouds, warm clouds, hot cores/hot corinos) and are exposed to different physical processes and energetic phenomena (proto-stellar heating, shock waves, intense UV radiation and cosmic rays). We show how the measured PO/PN ratio (either >1 as in e.g. hot molecular cores, or <1 as in UV strongly illuminated environments) can provide constraints on the physical conditions and energetic processing of the source. We propose that the reaction P + OH --> PO + H, not included in previous works, could be an efficient gas-phase PO formation route in shocks. Our modelling provides a template with which to study the detectability of P-bearing species not only in regions in our own Galaxy but also in extragalactic sources. "
"The BTeV Collaboration is starting to develop its C++ based offline software suite, an integral part of which is a series of tutorials. These tutorials are targeted at a diverse audience, including new graduate students, experienced physicists with little or no C++ experience, those with just enough C++ to be dangerous, and experts who need only an overview of the available tools. The tutorials must both teach C++ in general and the BTeV specific tools in particular. Finally, they must teach physicists how to find and use the detailed documentation. This report will review the status of the BTeV experiment, give an overview of the plans for and the state of the software and will then describe the plans for the tutorial suite. "
"Free-running Fabry-Perot lasers normally operate in a single-mode regime until the pumping current is increased beyond the single-mode instability threshold, above which they evolve into a multimode state. As a result of this instability, the single-mode operation of these lasers is typically constrained to few percents of their output power range, this being an undesired limitation in spectroscopy applications. In order to expand the span of single-mode operation, we use an optical injection seed generated by an external-cavity single-mode laser source to force the Fabry-Perot quantum cascade laser into a single-mode state in the high current range, where it would otherwise operate in a multimode regime. Utilizing this approach we achieve single-mode emission at room temperature with a tuning range of $36 \, \mathrm{cm}^-1$ and stable continuous-wave output power exceeding 1 W. Far-field measurements show that a single transverse mode is emitted up to the highest optical power indicating that the beam properties of the seeded Fabry-Perot laser remain unchanged as compared to free-running operation.

"The aim of this presentation is to promote the use of interval methods in the so called 'hard science', like physics or materials science. The example problem, simulation of ferromagnetic resonance spectra in amorphous wire, serves as an evidence of their power, even in their simplest, easy to understand, forms. The spectra, simulated for realistic values of anisotropy constants, show amazingly rich variety of their forms, probably never suspected by experimentalists. The method delivers guaranteed values of resonance fields for any orientation of the sample in the external magnetic field, not just for specific, 'highly symmetric', analytical cases; no resonance field is ever missed. The experimental data, to be published elsewhere, are in excellent concordance with numerical findings. "
"We consider a one-dimensional system consisting of a granular tracer particle of mass $M$ in a bath of thermalized particles each of mass $m$. When the mass ratio, $M/m$, is equal to the coefficient of restitution, $\alpha$, the system maps to a a one-dimensional elastic gas. In this case, Boltzmann equation can be solved exactly. We also obtain expressions for the velocity autocorrelation function and the diffusion coefficient. Numerical simulations of the Boltzmann equation are performed for $M/m\neq \alpha$ where no analytical solution is available. It appears that the dynamical features remain qualitatively similar to those found in the exactly solvable case. "
"In trained deep neural networks, unstructured pruning can reduce redundant weights to lower storage cost. However, it requires the customization of hardwares to speed up practical inference. Another trend accelerates sparse model inference on general-purpose hardwares by adopting coarse-grained sparsity to prune or regularize consecutive weights for efficient computation. But this method often sacrifices model accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel fine-grained sparsity approach, balanced sparsity, to achieve high model accuracy with commercial hardwares efficiently. Our approach adapts to high parallelism property of GPU, showing incredible potential for sparsity in the widely deployment of deep learning services. Experiment results show that balanced sparsity achieves up to 3.1x practical speedup for model inference on GPU, while retains the same high model accuracy as fine-grained sparsity. "
"During the recent years, tampering of digital images has become a general habit among people and professionals. As a result, establishment of image authenticity has become a key issue in fields those make use of digital images. Authentication of an image involves separation of original camera outputs from their tampered or Stego counterparts. Digital image cloning being a popular type of image tampering, in this paper we have experimentally analyzed seven different algorithms of cloning detection such as the simple overlapped block matching with lexicographic sorting (SOBMwLS) algorithm, block matching with discrete cosine transformation, principal component analysis, discrete wavelet transformation and singular value decomposition performed on the blocks (DCT, DWT, PCA, SVD), two combination models where, DCT and DWT are combined with singular value decomposition (DCTSVD and DWTSVD. A comparative study of all these techniques with respect to their time complexities and robustness of detection against various post processing operations such as cropping, brightness and contrast adjustments are presented in the paper.

"Spatial smoothing is a widely used preprocessing scheme to improve the performance of high-resolution parameter estimation algorithms in case of coherent signals or if only a small number of snapshots is available. In this paper, we present a first-order performance analysis of the spatially smoothed versions of R-D Standard ESPRIT and R-D Unitary ESPRIT for sources with arbitrary signal constellations as well as R-D NC Standard ESPRIT and R-D NC Unitary ESPRIT for strictly second-order (SO) non-circular (NC) sources. The derived expressions are asymptotic in the effective signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), i.e., the approximations become exact for either high SNRs or a large sample size. Moreover, no assumptions on the noise statistics are required apart from a zero-mean and finite SO moments. We show that both R-D NC ESPRIT-type algorithms with spatial smoothing perform asymptotically identical in the high effective SNR regime. Generally, the performance of spatial smoothing based algorithms depends on the number of subarrays, which is a design parameter and needs to be chosen beforehand. In order to gain more insights into the optimal choice of the number of subarrays, we simplify the derived analytical R-D mean square error (MSE) expressions for the special case of a single source. The obtained MSE expression explicitly depends on the number of subarrays in each dimension, which allows us to analytically find the optimal number of subarrays for spatial smoothing. Based on this result, we additionally derive the maximum asymptotic gain from spatial smoothing and explicitly compute the asymptotic efficiency for this special case. All the analytical results are verified by simulations. "
"We present a general formulation of the theory for a non-minimally coupled perfect fluid in which both conformal and disformal couplings are present. We discuss how such non-minimal coupling is compatible with the assumptions of a perfect fluid and derive both the Einstein and the fluid equations for such model. We found that, while the Euler equation is significantly modified with the introduction of an extra force related to the local gradients of the curvature, the continuity equation is unaltered, thus allowing for the definition of conserved quantities along the fluid flow. As an application to cosmology and astrophysics we compute the effects of the non-minimal coupling on a Friedmann--Lema\^itre--Robertson--Walker metric at both background and linear perturbation level and on the Newtonian limit of our theory. "
This is the first of two papers examining the critical collapse of spherically symmetric perfect fluids with the equation of state P = (Gamma -1)rho. Here we present the equations of motion and describe a computer code capable of simulating the extremely relativistic flows encountered in critical solutions for Gamma <= 2. The fluid equations are solved using a high-resolution shock-capturing scheme based on a linearized Riemann solver.
"The CKM matrix element $|V_{cb}|$ can be extracted by combining experimentally determined branching fractions for $\bar{B}\to D^{(*)}\ell\bar{\nu}$ decays with form factors from the lattice. While successful, the precision of this approach has been limited by heavy-quark discretization effects. An improved version of the Fermilab action, the Oktay-Kronfeld action, can be used to reduce heavy-quark discretization effects in calculations performed at the physical bottom and charm quark masses. Treating charm and bottom quarks as massive, we are carrying out improvement of the flavor-changing currents through third order in the momentum (HQET) expansion. "
"The recent success of brain-inspired deep neural networks (DNNs) in solving complex, high-level visual tasks has led to rising expectations for their potential to match the human visual system. However, DNNs exhibit idiosyncrasies that suggest their visual representation and processing might be substantially different from human vision. One limitation of DNNs is that they are vulnerable to adversarial examples, input images on which subtle, carefully designed noises are added to fool a machine classifier. The robustness of the human visual system against adversarial examples is potentially of great importance as it could uncover a key mechanistic feature that machine vision is yet to incorporate. In this study, we compare the visual representations of white- and black-box adversarial examples in DNNs and humans by leveraging functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We find a small but significant difference in representation patterns for different (i.e. white- versus black- box) types of adversarial examples for both humans and DNNs. However, human performance on categorical judgment is not degraded by noise regardless of the type unlike DNN. These results suggest that adversarial examples may be differentially represented in the human visual system, but unable to affect the perceptual experience. "
"We report on the theoretical investigation of photonic crystal cavities etched on a suspended membrane for the generation of polarization entangled photon pairs using the biexciton cascade in a single quantum dot. The implementation of spontaneous emission enhancement effect increases the entanglement visibility, while the concomitant preferential funneling of the emission in the cavity mode increases the collection of both entangled photons. We demonstrate and quantify that standard cavity designs present a polarization dependent emission diagram, detrimental to entanglement. The optimization of H1 cavities allows to obtain both high collection efficiencies and polarization independent emission, while keeping high Purcell factors necessary for high quality entangled photon sources. "
"This article explores the novel notion of gyrogroup actions, which is a natural generalization of the usual notion of group actions. As a first step toward the study of gyrogroup actions from the algebraic viewpoint, we prove three well-known theorems in group theory for gyrogroups: the orbit-stabilizer theorem, the orbit decomposition theorem, and the Burnside lemma (or the Cauchy-Frobenius lemma). We then prove that under a certain condition, a gyrogroup $G$ acts transitively on the set $G/H$ of left cosets of a subgyrogroup $H$ in $G$ in a natural way. From this we prove the structure theorem that every transitive action of a gyrogroup can be realized as a gyrogroup action by left gyroaddition. We also exhibit concrete examples of gyrogroup actions from the M\""obius and Einstein gyrogroups. "
"Let X be a holomorphic symplectic manifold, of dimension divisible by 4, and s an antisymplectic involution of X . The fixed locus F of s is a Lagrangian submanifold of X ; we show that its \^A-genus is 1. As an application, we determine all possibilities for the Chern numbers of F when X is a deformation of the Hilbert square of a K3 surface. "
"We analyze the ROSAT Deep Cluster Survey (RDCS) to derive cosmological constraints from the evolution of the cluster X-ray luminosity distribution. The sample contains 103 galaxy clusters out to z=0.85 and flux-limit Flim=3 10^{-14} cgs (RDCS-3) in the [0.5-2.0] keV energy band, with a high-z extension containing four clusters at 0.90<z<1.26 and F>1 10^{-14} cgs (RDCS-1). Model predictions for the cluster mass function are converted into the X-ray luminosity function in two steps. First we convert mass into intra-cluster gas temperature by assuming hydrostatic equilibrium. Then temperature is converted into X-ray luminosity by using the most recent data on the Lx-T relation for nearby and distant clusters. These include the Chandra data for seven distant clusters at 0.57<z<1.27. From RDCS-3 we find \Omega_m=0.35+/-0.12 and \sigma_8=0.66+/-0.06 for a spatially flat Universe with cosmological constant, with no significant constraint on \Gamma . Even accounting for theoretical and observational uncertainties in the mass/X-ray luminosity conversion, an Einstein-de-Sitter model is always excluded at far more than the 3sigma level. "
"Fix a strictly positive measure $W$ on the $d$-dimensional torus $\bb T^d$. For an integer $N\ge 1$, denote by $W^N_x$, $x=(x_1, ..., x_d)$, $0\le x_i <N$, the $W$-measure of the cube $[x/N, (x+\mb 1)/N)$, where $\mb 1$ is the vector with all components equal to 1. In dimension 1, we prove that the hydrodynamic behavior of a superposition of independent random walks, in which a particle jumps from $x/N$ to one of its neighbors at rate $(N W^N_x)^{-1}$, is described in the diffusive scaling by the linear differential equation $\partial_t \rho = (d/dW)(d/dx) \rho$. In dimension $d>1$, if $W$ is a finite discrete measure, $W=\sum_{i\ge 1} w_i \delta_{x_i}$, we prove that the random walk which jumps from $x/N$ uniformly to one of its neighbors at rate $(W^N_x)^{-1}$ has a metastable behavior, as defined in \cite{bl1}, described by the $K$-process introduced in \cite{fm1}. "
"In the present paper an introduction to the new subject of nonlinear dispersive hamiltonian equations on graphs is given. The focus is on recently established properties of solutions in the case of nonlinear Schr\""odinger equation. Special consideration is given to existence and behaviour of solitary solutions. Two subjects are discussed in some detail concerning NLS equation on a star graph: the standing waves of NLS equation on a graph with a $\delta$ interaction at the vertex; the scattering of fast solitons through an Y-junction in the cubic case. The emphasis is on description of concepts and results and on physical context, without reporting detailed proofs; some perspectives and more ambitious open problems are discussed. "
"It has been shown that graph-cover pseudocodewords can be used to characterize the behavior of sum-product algorithm (SPA) decoding of classical codes. In this paper, we leverage and adapt these results to analyze SPA decoding of quantum stabilizer codes. We use the obtained insights to formulate modifications to the SPA that overcome some of its weaknesses. "
"One-loop radiative Majorana neutrino masses through the exchange of scalars have been considered for many years. We show for the first time how such a one-loop mass is also possible through the exchange of vector gauge bosons. It is based on a simple variation of a recently proposed $SU(2)_N$ extension of the standard model, where a vector boson is a candidate for the dark matter of the Universe. "
"The anthropic principle is an inevitable constraint on the space of possible theories. As such it is central to determining the limits of physics. In particular, we contend that what is ultimately possible in physics is determined by restrictions on the computational capacity of the universe, and that observers are more likely to be found where more complicated calculations are possible. Our discussion covers the inevitability of theoretical bias and how anthropics and computation can be an aid to imposing these biases on the theory landscape in a systematic way. Further, we argue for (as far as possible) top-down rather than bottom-up anthropic measures, contending that that the latter can often be misleading. We begin the construction of an explicit computational measure by examining the effect of the cosmological constant on computational bounds in a given universe, drawing from previous work on using entropy production as a proxy for observers by Bousso, Harnik, Kribs and Perez. In addition, we highlight a few of the additional computational considerations that may be used to extend such a measure. "
"The existence of a solution, convergence and stability of the penalty method for variational inequalities with nonsmooth unbounded uniformly and properly monotone operators in Banach spase $B$ are investigated. All the objects of the inequality - the operator A, ""the right-hand part"" $f$ and the set of constrains $\Omega $ - are to be perturbed. The stability theorems are formulated in terms of geometric characteristics of the spaces $B$ and $B^*$. The results of this paper are continuity and generalization of the Lions' ones, published earlier in \cite{l}. They are new even in Hilbert spaces. "
"Let $M$ be an even-dimensional, oriented closed manifold. We show that the restriction of a singular Riemannian flow on $M$ to a small tubular neighborhood of each connected component of its singular stratum is foliated-diffeomorphic to an isometric flow on the same neighborhood. We then prove a formula that computes characteristic numbers of $M$ as the sum of residues associated to the infinitesimal foliation at the components of the singular stratum of the flow. "
"By using the diffusion Monte Carlo method we calculate the one- and two-body density matrix of an interacting Fermi gas at T=0 in the BCS-BEC crossover. Results for the momentum distribution of the atoms, as obtained from the Fourier transform of the one-body density matrix, are reported as a function of the interaction strength. Off-diagonal long-range order in the system is investigated through the asymptotic behavior of the two-body density matrix. The condensate fraction of fermionic pairs is calculated in the unitary limit and on both sides of the BCS-BEC crossover. "
"We study the low transverse momentum (p_T) distribution of the Z-boson at hadron colliders for p_T ~ Lambda_{QCD} using a factorization and resummation formula derived in the Soft Collinear Effective Theory (SCET). In the region p_T ~ Lambda_{QCD}, new non-perturbative effects arise that cannot be entirely captured by the standard parton distribution functions, and require an additional new non-perturbative transverse momentum function (TMF). The TMF is field-theoretically defined in SCET, fully gauge invariant, and captures the non-perturbative dynamics that affects the p_T-distribution in the region p_T ~ Lambda_{QCD}. The TMF also reduces to the expected perturbative result in the region p_T >> Lambda_{QCD}. We develop phenomenological models for these TMFs in the non-perturbative region and present example fits to the available data. "
"We provide an affirmative answer to a question posed by Tod \cite{Tod:1995b}, and construct all four-dimensional Kahler metrics with vanishing scalar curvature which are invariant under the conformal action of Bianchi V group. The construction is based on the combination of twistor theory and the isomonodromic problem with two double poles. The resulting metrics are non-diagonal in the left-invariant basis and are explicitly given in terms of Bessel functions and their integrals. We also make a connection with the LeBrun ansatz, and characterise the associated solutions of the SU(\infty) Toda equation by the existence a non-abelian two-dimensional group of point symmetries. "
"The fermionic molecular dynamics approach uses Gaussian wave packets as single-particle basis states. Many-body basis states are Slater determinants projected on parity, angular momentum and total linear momentum. The wave-packet basis is very flexible - FMD contains harmonic oscillator shell model and Brink-type cluster states as special cases. The parameters of the wave packets are obtained by variation. A realistic effective interaction derived from the Argonne V18 interaction by means of the unitary correlation operator method is employed. We discuss the fully microscopic calculation of the 3He(alpha,gamma)7Be capture reaction within the FMD approach. The model space contains frozen cluster configurations at large distances and polarized configurations in the interaction region. The polarized configurations are essential for a successful description of the 7Be bound state properties and for the S- and D-wave scattering states. The calculated cross section agrees well with recent measurements regarding both the absolute normalization and the energy dependence. We also discuss the structure of the cluster states, including the famous Hoyle state, in 12C. From the two-body densities we conclude that the Hoyle state has a spatially extended triangular alpha-cluster structure, whereas the third 0+ state features a chain-like obtuse triangle structure. We also calculate the N hbar Omega decomposition of our wave functions to illuminate the challenges of no-core shell model calculations for these cluster states. "
"We calculate the tensor and axial charges of the quark in the Schwinger-Dyson formalism of Landau gauge QCD. It is found that the dressed tensor and isovector axial charges of the quark are suppressed against the bare quark contribution, and the result agrees qualitatively with the experimental data. We show that this is due to the superposition of the spin flip of the quark arising from the successive emission of gluons which dress the vertex. For the isoscalar quark axial charge, we have analyzed the Schwinger-Dyson equation by including the leading unquenching quark-loop effect. It is found that the suppression is more significant, due to the axial anomaly effect. "
"Paramagnetic, dipolar Hund's case-a radicals are considered in the presence of arbitrary, non-collinear combinations of electric and magnetic fields. The field-dependent part of the Hamiltonian is found to be exactly diagonalizable, and described by quantum numbers given by the projection of the molecule's total angular momentum along a space-fixed axis that is determined by both the fields and the electric and magnetic dipole moments of the molecule. In cases of strong fields, this procedure identifies a set of quantum numbers for the molecule in crossed fields. We dub this set a ""Hund's case-X"" basis. "
"We claim that for calculations of the electronic structure of 3d oxides very strong electron correlations have to be taken into account similarly to those assumed in many-electron crystal field approach. For Co3+ ions in NaxCoO2.yH2O there are 15 low lying many-electron states within 0.1 eV as can be obtained in the many-electron CEF approach with taking into account the spin-orbit coupling. We claim, that the used by us Hamiltonian for the trigonal distortion is correct. "
"These lecture notes present an overview of equilibrium statistical mechanics of classical fluids, with special applications to the structural and thermodynamic properties of systems made of particles interacting via the hard-sphere potential or closely related model potentials. The exact statistical-mechanical properties of one-dimensional systems, the issue of thermodynamic (in)consistency among different routes in the context of several approximate theories, and the construction of analytical or semi-analytical approximations for the structural properties are also addressed. "
"We present in the context of supersymmetric gauge theories an extension of the Weyl integration formula, first discovered by Robert Wendt, which applies to a class of non-connected Lie groups. This allows to count in a systematic way gauge-invariant chiral operators for these non-connected gauge groups. Applying this technique to $\mathrm{O}(n)$, we obtain, via the ADHM construction, the Hilbert series for certain instanton moduli spaces. We validate our general method and check our results via a Coulomb branch computation, using three-dimensional mirror symmetry. "
"Non-orthogonal space-time block codes (STBC) with {\em large dimensions} are attractive because they can simultaneously achieve both high spectral efficiencies (same spectral efficiency as in V-BLAST for a given number of transmit antennas) {\em as well as} full transmit diversity. Decoding of non-orthogonal STBCs with large dimensions has been a challenge. In this paper, we present a reactive tabu search (RTS) based algorithm for decoding non-orthogonal STBCs from cyclic division algebras (CDA) having large dimensions. Under i.i.d fading and perfect channel state information at the receiver (CSIR), our simulation results show that RTS based decoding of $12\times 12$ STBC from CDA and 4-QAM with 288 real dimensions achieves $i)$ $10^{-3}$ uncoded BER at an SNR of just 0.5 dB away from SISO AWGN performance, and $ii)$ a coded BER performance close to within about 5 dB of the theoretical MIMO capacity, using rate-3/4 turbo code at a spectral efficiency of 18 bps/Hz. RTS is shown to achieve near SISO AWGN performance with less number of dimensions than with LAS algorithm (which we reported recently) at some extra complexity than LAS. We also report good BER performance of RTS when i.i.d fading and perfect CSIR assumptions are relaxed by considering a spatially correlated MIMO channel model, and by using a training based iterative RTS decoding/channel estimation scheme. "
"We calculate how much a first-quantized string is excited after crossing the inner horizon of charged Vaidya solutions, as a simple model of generic black holes. To quantize a string suitably, we first show that the metric is approximated by a {\it plane-wave} metric near the inner horizon when the surface gravity of the horizon $\kappa_I$ is small enough. Next, it is analytically shown that the string crossing the inner horizon is excited infinitely in an asymptotically flat spacetime, while it is finite in an asymptotically de Sitter spacetime and the string can pass across the inner horizon when $\kappa_I<2\kappa:= 2 {min}\{\kappa_B,\kappa_C \}$, where $\kappa_B$~($\kappa_C$) is the surface gravity of the black hole~(cosmological) event horizon. This implies that the strong cosmic censorship holds in an asymptotically flat spacetime, while it is violated in an asymptotically de Sitter spacetime from the point of view of string theory. "
"We report the discovery of a small aggregate of young stars seen in high-resolution, deep near-infrared ($JHK_S$) images towards IRAS 06345-3023 in the outer Galaxy and well below the mid-plane of the Galactic disc. The group of young stars is likely to be composed of low-mass stars, mostly Class I young stellar objects. The stars are seen towards a molecular cloud whose CO map peaks at the location of the IRAS source. The near-infrared images reveal, additionally, the presence of nebular emission with rich morphological features, including arcs in the vicinity of embedded stars, wisps and bright rims of a butterfly-shaped dark cloud. The location of this molecular cloud as a new star formation site well below the Galactic plane in the outer Galaxy indicates that active star formation is taking place at vertical distances larger than those typical of the (thin) disc. "
"Autonomous service robots require computational frameworks that allow them to generalize knowledge to new situations in a manner that models uncertainty while scaling to real-world problem sizes. The Robot Common Sense Embedding (RoboCSE) showcases a class of computational frameworks, multi-relational embeddings, that have not been leveraged in robotics to model semantic knowledge. We validate RoboCSE on a realistic home environment simulator (AI2Thor) to measure how well it generalizes learned knowledge about object affordances, locations, and materials. Our experiments show that RoboCSE can perform prediction better than a baseline that uses pre-trained embeddings, such as Word2Vec, achieving statistically significant improvements while using orders of magnitude less memory than our Bayesian Logic Network baseline. In addition, we show that predictions made by RoboCSE are robust to significant reductions in data available for training as well as domain transfer to MatterPort3D, achieving statistically significant improvements over a baseline that memorizes training data. "
Kaluza-Klein (KK) parity can be violated in five-dimensional universal extra dimensional model with boundary-localized (kinetic or mass) terms (BLTs) at the fixed points of $S^1/Z_2$ orbifold. In this framework we study the resonant production of Kaluza-Klein excitations of the neutral electroweak gauge bosons at the LHC and their decay into an electron-positron pair or a muon-antimuon pair. We use the results (first time in our knowledge) given by the LHC experiment to constrain the mass range of the first KK-excitation of the electroweak gauge bosons ($B^1\ \textrm{and} \ W_3^1$). It is interesting to note that the LHC result puts an upper limit on the masses of the $n=1$ KK-leptons for positive values of BLT parameters and depending upon the mass of $\ell^{+}\ell^{-}$ resonance.
"The random intensity of noise approach to one-dimensional Laval-Dubrulle-Nazarenko type model having deductive support from the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equation is used to describe Lagrangian acceleration statistics of a fluid particle in developed turbulent flows. Intensity of additive noise and cross correlation between multiplicative and additive noises entering a nonlinear Langevin equation are assumed to depend on random velocity fluctuations in an exponential way. We use exact analytic result for the acceleration probability density function obtained as a stationary solution of the associated Fokker-Planck equation. We give a complete quantitative description of the available experimental data on conditional and unconditional acceleration statistics within the framework of a single model with a single set of fit parameters. The acceleration distribution and variance conditioned on Lagrangian velocity fluctuations, and the marginal distribution calculated by using independent Gaussian velocity statistics are found to be in a good agreement with the recent high-Reynolds-number Lagrangian experimental data. The fitted conditional mean acceleration is very small, that is in agreement with DNS, and increases for higher velocities but it departs from the experimental data, which exhibit anisotropy of the studied flow. "
"We search for standard model single-top-quark production in the W-gluon fusion and W* channels using 106 pb^-1 of data from p-pbar collisions at sqrt(s)=1.8 TeV collected with the Collider Detector at Fermilab. We set an upper limit at 95% C.L. on the combined W-gluon fusion and W* single-top cross section of 14 pb, roughly six times larger than the standard model prediction. Separate 95% C.L. upper limits in the W-gluon fusion and W* channels are also determined and are found to be 13 and 18 pb, respectively. "
"We present a vector formulation of an interferometric observation of a star, including the effects of the barycentric motion of the observatory, the proper motions of the star, and the reflex motions of the star due to orbiting planets. We use this model to empirically determine the magnitude and form of the signal due to a single Earth-mass planet orbiting about a sun-mass star. Using bounding values for the known components of the model, we perform a series of expansions, comparing the residuals to this signal. We demonstrate why commonly used first order linearizations of similar measurement models are insufficient for signals of the magnitude of the one due to an Earth-mass planet, and present a consistent expansion which is linear in the unknown quantities, with residuals multiple orders of magnitude below the Earth-mass planet signal. We also discuss numerical issues that can arise when simulating or analyzing these measurements. "
Geometric positions of square roots of quasi-free states of CCR algebras are investigated together with an explicit formula for transition amplitudes among them.
"In a previous work [math.AP/0305408] three of us have studied a nonlinear parabolic equation arising in the mesoscopic modelling of concentrated suspensions of particles that are subjected to a given time-dependent shear rate. In the present work we extend the model to allow for a more physically relevant situation when the shear rate actually depends on the macroscopic velocity of the fluid, and as a feedback the macroscopic velocity is influenced by the average stress in the fluid. The geometry considered is that of a planar Couette flow. The mathematical system under study couples the one-dimensional heat equation and a nonlinear Fokker-Planck type equation with nonhomogeneous, nonlocal and possibly degenerate, coefficients. We show the existence and the uniqueness of the global-in-time weak solution to such a system. "
"We compare the gamma-ray photon flux variability of northern blazars in the Fermi/LAT First Source Catalog with 37 GHz radio flux density curves from the Metsahovi quasar monitoring program. We find that the relationship between simultaneous millimeter (mm) flux density and gamma-ray photon flux is different for different types of blazars. The flux relation between the two bands is positively correlated for quasars and does no exist for BLLacs. Furthermore, we find that the levels of gamma-ray emission in high states depend on the phase of the high frequency radio flare, with the brightest gamma-ray events coinciding with the initial stages of a mm flare. The mean observed delay from the beginning of a mm flare to the peak of the gamma-ray emission is about 70 days, which places the average location of the gamma-ray production at or downstream of the radio core. We discuss alternative scenarios for the production of gamma-rays at distances of parsecs along the length of the jet "
"In the description of general covariance, the vierbein and the Lorentz connection can be treated as independent fundamental fields. With the usual gauge Lagrangian, the Lorentz connection is characterized by an asymptotically free running coupling. When running from high energy, the coupling gets large at a scale which can be called the Planck mass. If the Lorentz connection is confined at that scale, the low energy theory can have the Einstein Lagrangian induced at low energy through dimensional transmutation. However, in general there will be new divergences in such a theory and the Lagrangian basis should be expanded. I construct a conformally invariant model with a larger basis size which potentially may have the same property. "
"We investigate the thermalization time scale in the planar limit of the SU(N) N=4 SYM plasma at strong yet finite 't Hooft coupling by considering its supergravity dual description, including the full O(alpha'^3) type IIB string theory corrections. We also discuss on the effects of the leading non-planar corrections. We use extended geometric probes in the bulk which are dual to different non-local observables in the N=4 SYM theory. This is carried out within the framework of dynamical holographic thermalization. "
"We present an image-based method for comparing the structural properties of galaxies produced in hydrodynamical simulations to real galaxies in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey. The key feature of our work is the introduction of extensive observational realism, such as object crowding, noise and viewing angle, to the synthetic images of simulated galaxies, so that they can be fairly compared to real galaxy catalogs. We apply our methodology to the dust-free synthetic image catalog of galaxies from the Illustris simulation at $z=0$, which are then fit with bulge+disc models to obtain morphological parameters. In this first paper in a series, we detail our methods, quantify observational biases, and present publicly available bulge+disc decomposition catalogs. We find that our bulge+disc decompositions are largely robust to the observational biases that affect decompositions of real galaxies. However, we identify a significant population of galaxies (roughly 30\% of the full sample) in Illustris that are prone to internal segmentation, leading to systematically reduced flux estimates by up to a factor of 6, smaller half-light radii by up to a factor of $\sim$ 2, and generally erroneous bulge-to-total fractions of (B/T)=0. "
"If T is a multiplicity-free contraction of class C_0 with minimal function m_T, then it is quasisimilar to the Jordan block S(m_T). In case m_T is a Blaschke product with simple roots forming a Carleson sequence, we show that the relation between T and S(m_T) can be strengthened to similarity. Under the additional assumption that u(T) has closed range for every inner divisor u of m_T, the result also holds in the more general setting where the roots have bounded multiplicities. "
"In this article, we continue our study of Baire one functions on a topological space $X$, denoted by $B_1(X)$ and extend the well known M. H. Stones's theorem from $C(X)$ to $B_1(X)$. Introducing the structure space of $B_1(X)$, it is observed that $X$ may not be embedded inside this structure space. This observation inspired us to build a space $\MMM(B_1(X))/\sim$, from the structure space of $B_1(X)$ and to show that $X$ is densely embedded in $\MMM(B_1(X))/\sim$. It is further established that it is a $T_0$-compactification of $X$. Such compactification of $X$ possesses the extension property for continuous functions, though it lacks Hausdorffness in general. Therefore, it is natural to search for condition(s) under which it becomes Hausdorff. In the last section, a set of necessary and sufficient conditions for such compactification to become a Stone-Ceck compatification, is finally arrived at. "
"In this article, virtualization security concerns in the cloud computing domain are reviewed. The focus is toward virtual machine (VM) security where attacks and vulnerabilities such as VM escape, VM hopping, cross-VM side-channel, VM-based rootkits (VMBRs), VM mobility, and VM remote are mentioned and discussed according to their relevance in the clouds. For each attack we outline how they affect the security of cloud systems. Countermeasures and security measures to detect or prevent them through techniques such as VM detection, GuardHype, VM introspection, VM image scanning, etc. are also discussed. Through the surveyed work we present a classification of VM threats within the clouds. Finally, we include our observations and those of other researchers on this matter of cloud virtualization security. "
"This paper links the conjecture that the physical world is a virtual reality to the findings of modern physics. What is usually the subject of science fiction is here proposed as a scientific theory open to empirical evaluation. We know from physics how the world behaves, and from computing how information behaves, so whether the physical world arises from ongoing information processing is a question science can evaluate. A prima facie case for the virtual reality conjecture is presented. If a photon is a pixel on a multi-dimensional grid that gives rise to space, the speed of light could reflect its refresh rate. If mass, charge and energy all arise from processing, the many conservation laws of physics could reduce to a single law of dynamic information conservation. If the universe is a virtual reality, then its big bang creation could be simply when the system was booted up. Deriving core physics from information processing could reconcile relativity and quantum theory, with the former how processing creates the space-time operating system and the latter how it creates energy and matter applications. "
KEKB was in operation from December 1988 to June 2010. The crab cavities were installed at KEKB in February 2007 and worked very stably until the end of KEKB operation. Operational experience of the crab cavities with beams is described.
"We review the use of quantum feedback for combatting the decoherence of Schroedinger-cat-like states in electromagnetic cavities, with special emphasys on our recent proposal of an automatic mechanism based on the injection of appropriately prepared ``probe'' and ``feedback'' Rydberg atoms. In the latter scheme, the information transmission from the probe to the feedback atom is directly mediated by a second auxiliary cavity. The detection efficiency for the probe atom is no longer a critical parameter, and the decoherence time of the linear superposition state can be significantly increased using presently available technology. "
"First experimental observations of the ferromagnetic shielding effect in high-Tc superconducting coated conductors were carried out. Experimental results were compared to simulations calling upon finite-element calculations based on the H-formulation of Maxwell equations to model superconducting strips with ferromagnetic shields. Samples of copper-stabilized coated conductors were electroplated with nickel shields and afterwards characterized. Both externally applied oscillating transverse magnetic fields as well as transport currents were studied. Having observed promising gains with respect to the reduction of ac losses in both cases, we further investigated the potential of ferromagnetic shielding. The numerical model was able to reproduce and also predict experimental results very well and will serve as an indispensable tool to determine the potential of soft ferromagnetic materials to significantly reduce hysteretic losses. "
"In 3D single particle imaging with X-ray free-electron lasers, particle orientation is not recorded during measurement but is instead recovered as a necessary step in the reconstruction of a 3D image from the diffraction data. Here we use harmonic analysis on the sphere to cleanly separate the angu- lar and radial degrees of freedom of this problem, providing new opportunities to efficiently use data and computational resources. We develop the Expansion-Maximization-Compression algorithm into a shell-by-shell approach and implement an angular bandwidth limit that can be gradually raised during the reconstruction. We study the minimum number of patterns and minimum rotation sampling required for a desired angular and radial resolution. These extensions provide new av- enues to improve computational efficiency and speed of convergence, which are critically important considering the very large datasets expected from experiment. "
"A convolutional neural network (CNN) approach is used to implement a level 2 autonomous vehicle by mapping pixels from the camera input to the steering commands. The network automatically learns the maximum variable features from the camera input, hence requires minimal human intervention. Given realistic frames as input, the driving policy trained on the dataset by NVIDIA and Udacity can adapt to real-world driving in a controlled environment. The CNN is tested on the CARLA open-source driving simulator. Details of a beta-testing platform are also presented, which consists of an ultrasonic sensor for obstacle detection and an RGBD camera for real-time position monitoring at 10Hz. Arduino Mega and Raspberry Pi are used for motor control and processing respectively to output the steering angle, which is converted to angular velocity for steering. "
"In this paper we explore the stability of an inverted pendulum with generalized parametric excitation described by a superposition of $N$ sines with different frequencies and phases. We show that when the amplitude is scaled with the frequency we obtain the stabilization of the real inverted pendulum, i.e., with values of $g$ according to planet Earth ($g\approx 9.8$m/s$^{2}$) for high frequencies. By randomly sorting the frequencies, we obtain a critical amplitude in light of perturbative theory in classical mechanics which is numerically tested by exploring its validity regime in many alternatives. We also analyse the effects when different values of $N$ as well as the pendulum size $l$ are taken into account. "
It is shown that a Bose gas of two-level atoms in the intense resonant laser field at zero temperature is a mixture of two condensates with a definite ratio of the densities. The criteria of stability are found for the stationary states of such system against the increment of the amplitudes of quasi Bogoliubov elementary excitations. Besides the usual acoustic mode the gap mode is shown to exist and the magnitude of the gap is proportional to the laser field amplitude. The involvement of the gas nonideality under definite conditions results in an instability and decay of the condensates.
"Quantum phase slippage (QPS) in a superconducting nanowire is a new candidate for developing a quantum bit. It has also been theoretically predicted that the occurrence of QPS significantly changes the current-phase relationship (CPR) of the wire due to the tunneling between topologically different metastable states. We present studies on the microwave response of the superconducting nanowires to reveal their CPRs. First, we demonstrate a simple nanowire fabrication technique, based on commercially available adhesive tapes, which allows making thin superconducting wire from different metals. We compare the resistance vs. temperature curves of Mo$_{76}$Ge$_{24}$ and Al nanowires to the classical and quantum models of phase slips. In order to describe the experimentally observed microwave responses of these nanowires, we use the McCumber-Stewart model, which is generalized to include either classical or quantum CPR. "
"We revisit the ``Smile Dynamics'' problem, which consists in relating the implied leverage (i.e. the correlation of the at-the-money volatility with the returns of the underlying) and the skew of the option smile. The ratio between these two quantities, called ``Skew-Stickiness Ratio'' (SSR) by Bergomi (Smile Dynamics IV, RISK, 94-100, December 2009), saturates to the value 2 for linear models in the limit of small maturities, and converges to 1 for long maturities. We show that for more general, non-linear models (such as the asymmetric GARCH model), Bergomi's result must be modified, and can be larger than 2 for small maturities. The discrepancy comes from the fact that the volatility skew is, in general, different from the skewness of the underlying. We compare our theory with empirical results, using data both from option markets and from the underlying price series, for the S&P500 and the DAX. We find, among other things, that although both the implied leverage and the skew appear to be too strong on option markets, their ratio is well explained by the theory. We observe that the SSR indeed becomes larger than 2 for small maturities. "
"A study of electromagnetic structure of the deuteron in the framework of relativistic quantum mechanics is presented. The deuteron form factors dependencies on the transferred 4-momentum Q are calculated. We compare results obtained with different realistic deuteron wave functions stemming from Nijmegen-I, Nijmegen-II, JISP16, CD-Bonn, Paris and Moscow (with forbidden states) potentials. A nucleon form factor parametrization consistent with modern experimental analysis was used as an input data. "
"We introduce and study a novel semi-random multigraph process, described as follows. The process starts with an empty graph on $n$ vertices. In every round of the process, one vertex $v$ of the graph is picked uniformly at random and independently of all previous rounds. We then choose an additional vertex (according to a strategy of our choice) and connect it by an edge to $v$. For various natural monotone increasing graph properties $P$, we prove tight upper and lower bounds on the minimum (extended over the set of all possible strategies) number of rounds required by the process to obtain, with high probability, a graph that satisfies $P$. Along the way, we show that the process is general enough to approximate (using suitable strategies) several well-studied random graph models. "
"In this paper we survey the effects of residual long-range forces associated to $\gamma_5$-spin dependent-couplings of fermions to massless bosons exerted by unpolarised bulk matter over macroscopic distances. We establish that such forces with behaviour proportional to $R^{-6}$ do indeed exist. They arise as a quantum mechanical effect due to simultaneous exchange of two quanta. We explore their presence in existing astronomical as well as laboratory data on non-newtonian components of the force between macroscopic bodies. Since no limits on their real existence could be found, we conclude that residual long-range pseudoscalar attractive and composition dependent forces between neutral unpolarised bulk matter extending over macroscopic distances are very efficiently shielded over a huge range of distances: from astronomical scales down to the micron scale.

"We focus on the use of a mu-tau interchange symmetry to explain features of lepton mixing, especially maximal atmospheric neutrino mixing. We review two models which achieve this goal and are based on the seesaw mechanism and on the soft breaking of the family-lepton-number symmetries. We also note that that symmetry may be embedded in a generalized CP symmetry. We show that, in the context of some of our models, arguments of naturalness may be used for explaining the smallness of the mass ratio m_mu / m_tau. "
"Cooperative effects of periodic force and noise in globally Cooperative effects of periodic force and noise in globally coupled systems are studied using a nonlinear diffusion equation for the number density. The amplitude of the order parameter oscillation is enhanced in an intermediate range of noise strength for a globally coupled bistable system, and the order parameter oscillation is entrained to the external periodic force in an intermediate range of noise strength. These enhancement phenomena of the response of the order parameter in the deterministic equations are interpreted as stochastic resonance and stochastic synchronization in globally coupled systems. "
"We study the influence of weak periodic signals on the transport properties of underdamped ratchets. We find that the constant current intervals related to the ratchet, can be significantly enlarged by a weak subharmonic signal which is in phase with the internal driver. This stabilization phenomenon is found to exist both in absence and in presence of noise. The dependence of this effect on the phase of the applied signal is also investigated. "
"Let $\textbf{A}$ be a symmetric convex quadratic form on $\mathbb{R}^{Nn}$ and $\Omega\Subset \mathbb{R}^n$ a bounded convex domain. We consider the problem of existence of solutions $u: \Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^n \longrightarrow \mathbb{R}^N$ to the problem \[ \tag{1} \label{1} \begin{split} \sum_{\beta=1}^N\sum_{i,j=1}^n \textbf{A}_{\alpha i \beta j}\, D^2_{ij}u_\beta \,=\, f_\alpha, \text{ in }\Omega,\quad \ u\,=\, 0, \text{ on }\partial \Omega, \end{split} \] when $ f\in L^2(\Omega,\mathbb{R}^N)$. \eqref{1} is degenerate elliptic and it has not been considered before without the assumption of strict rank-one convexity. In general, it may not have even distributional solutions. By introducing an extension of distributions adapted to \eqref{1}, we prove existence, partial regularity and by imposing an extra condition uniqueness as well. The satisfaction of the boundary condition is also an issue due to the low regularity of the solution. The motivation to study \eqref{1} and the method of the proof arose from recent work of the author [K4, arXiv:1501.06164] on generalised solutions for fully nonlinear systems. "
"A ""magic rectangle"" of eleven observables of four qubits, employed by Harvey and Chryssanthacopoulos (2008) to prove the Bell-Kochen-Specker theorem in a 16-dimensional Hilbert space, is given a neat finite-geometrical reinterpretation in terms of the structure of the symplectic polar space $W(7, 2)$ of the real four-qubit Pauli group. Each of the four sets of observables of cardinality five represents an elliptic quadric in the three-dimensional projective space of order two (PG$(3, 2)$) it spans, whereas the remaining set of cardinality four corresponds to an affine plane of order two. The four ambient PG$(3, 2)$s of the quadrics intersect pairwise in a line, the resulting six lines meeting in a point. Projecting the whole configuration from this distinguished point (observable) one gets another, complementary ""magic rectangle"" of the same qualitative structure. "
"In this paper we study the Near-Gathering problem for a finite set of dimensionless, deterministic, asynchronous, anonymous, oblivious and autonomous mobile robots with limited visibility moving in the Euclidean plane in Look-Compute-Move (LCM) cycles. In this problem, the robots have to get close enough to each other, so that every robot can see all the others, without touching (i.e., colliding with) any other robot. The importance of solving the Near-Gathering problem is that it makes it possible to overcome the restriction of having robots with limited visibility. Hence it allows to exploit all the studies (the majority, actually) done on this topic in the unlimited visibility setting. Indeed, after the robots get close enough to each other, they are able to see all the robots in the system, a scenario that is similar to the one where the robots have unlimited visibility. We present the first (deterministic) algorithm for the Near-Gathering problem, to the best of our knowledge, which allows a set of autonomous mobile robots to nearly gather within finite time without ever colliding. Our algorithm assumes some reasonable conditions on the input configuration (the Near-Gathering problem is easily seen to be unsolvable in general). Further, all the robots are assumed to have a compass (hence they agree on the ""North"" direction), but they do not necessarily have the same handedness (hence they may disagree on the clockwise direction). We also show how the robots can detect termination, i.e., detect when the Near-Gathering problem has been solved. This is crucial when the robots have to perform a generic task after having nearly gathered. We show that termination detection can be obtained even if the total number of robots is unknown to the robots themselves (i.e., it is not a parameter of the algorithm), and robots have no way to explicitly communicate. "
"We theoretically investigate the phenomena of adiabatic quantum charge pumping through a normal-insulator-superconductor-insulator-normal (NISIN) setup of silicene within the scattering matrix formalism. Assuming thin barrier limit, we consider the strength of the two barriers ($\chi_{1}$ and $\chi_{2}$) as the two pumping parameters in the adiabatic regime. Within this geometry, we obtain crossed Andreev reflection (CAR) with probability unity in the $\chi_{1}$-$\chi_{2}$ plane without concomitant transmission or elastic cotunneling (CT). Tunability of the band gap at the Dirac point by applying an external electric field perpendicular to the silicene sheet and variation of the chemical potential at the normal silicene region, open up the possibility of achieving perfect either CAR or transmission process through our setup. This resonant behavior is periodic with the barrier strengths. We analyze the behavior of the pumped charge through the NISIN structure as a function of the pumping strength and angles of the incident electrons. We show that large ($Q\sim2e$) pumped charge can be obtained through our geometry when the pumping contour encloses either the CAR or transmission resonance in the pumping parameter space. We discuss possible experimental feasibility of our theoretical predictions. "
"Introduction. The aim is to provide a summary of methods available for the assessment of tear turnover and tear clearance rates. The review defines tear clearance and tear turnover and describes their implication for ocular surface health. Additionally, it describes main types of techniques for measuring tear turnover, including fluorescein tear clearance tests, techniques utilizing electromagnetic spectrum and tracer molecule and novel experimental techniques utilizing optical coherence tomography and fluorescein profilometry. Areas covered. Internet databases (PubMed, Science Direct, Google Scholar) and most frequently cited references were used as a principal resource of information on tear turnover rate and tear clearance rate, presenting methodologies and equipment, as well as their definition and implications for the anterior eye surface health and function. Keywords used for data-search were as follows: tear turnover, tear clearance, fluorescein clearance, scintigraphy, fluorophotometry, tear flow, drainage, tear meniscus dynamics, Krehbiel flow and lacrimal functional unit. Expert Commentary. After decades, the topic of tear turnover assessment is reintroduced. Recently, new techniques have been developed to propose less invasive, less time consuming and simpler methodologies for the assessment of tear dynamics that have the potential to be utilized in a clinical practice. Keywords. Fluorescein clearance test, fluorophotometry, tear clearance, tear film dynamics, tear turnover, scintigraphy, optical coherence tomography. "
"The study of heavy-ion collisions has currently unprecedented opportunities with two first class facilities, the Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) at BNL and the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN, and five large experiments ALICE, ATLAS, CMS, PHENIX and STAR producing a wealth of high quality data. Selected results recently obtained are presented on the study of flow, energy loss and direct photons. "
"In this paper, we show that the quantum bound state problems are mapped to $N$ point vortices with the identical circulation or strength using the Steiljes electrostatic model with imaginary charges. We also show that these $N$ point charges or vortices, become imaginary, in a constant background field will admit a wave solution under paraxial wave approximation. Therefore, in quantum mechanics as long as paraxial approximation is valid it behaves like a wave. "
"We report on a semi-empirical tight binding model for 3C-SiC including the effect of sp3d5s* orbitals and spin-orbital coupling. In this work, we illustrate in detail the method to develop such a model for semiconductors with zincblende structure, based on Slater-Koster integrals, and we explain the optimization method used to fit the experimental results with such a model. This method shows high accuracy for the evaluation of 3C-SiC band diagram both in terms of the experimental energy levels at high symmetry points and the effective masses. "
"Generating big data pervades much of physics. But some problems, which we call extreme data problems, are too large to be treated within big data science. The nonequilibrium quantum many-body problem on a lattice is just such a problem, where the Hilbert space grows exponentially with system size and rapidly becomes too large to fit on any computer (and can be effectively thought of as an infinite-sized data set). Nevertheless, much progress has been made with computational methods on this problem, which serve as a paradigm for how one can approach and attack extreme data problems. In addition, viewing these physics problems from a computer-science perspective leads to new approaches that can be tried to solve them more accurately and for longer times. We review a number of these different ideas here. "
"The effect of electronic band curvature, i.e. the deviation from parabolicity of electronic dispersion, on de Haas-van Alphen oscillations spectra is studied. Although the oscillations amplitude remain unaffected, it is demonstrated that non-quadratic terms of the Landau bands dispersion, which is particularly relevant in the case of Dirac fermions, induces a field- and temperature-dependent Onsager phase. As a result, a temperature-dependent shift of the de Haas-van Alphen oscillations frequency is predicted. "
"We study the capability of the space-based gravitational wave observatory TianQin to test the no-hair theorem of General Relativity, using the ringdown signal from the coalescence of massive black hole binaries. We parameterize the ringdown signal by the four strongest quasinormal modes and estimate the signal to noise ratio for various source parameters. We consider constraints both from single detections and from all the events combined throughout the lifetime of the observatory, for different astrophysical models. We find that at the end of the mission, TianQin will have constrained deviations of the frequency and decay time of the dominant 22 mode from the general relativistic predictions to within 0.2% and 1.5% respectively, the frequencies of the subleading modes can be also constrained within 0.3%. We also find that TianQin and LISA are highly complementary, by virtue of their different frequency windows. Indeed, LISA can best perform ringdown tests for black hole masses in excess of $\sim 3\times 10^6 M_\odot$, while TianQin is best suited for lower masses. "
"In characteristic two and dimension two, wild Z/2Z-actions on k[[u,v]] ramified precisely at the origin were classified by Artin, who showed in particular that they induce hypersurface singularities. We introduce in this article a new class of wild quotient singularities in any characteristic p>0 arising from certain non-linear actions of Z/pZ on the formal power series ring in n variables. These actions are ramified precisely at the origin, and their rings of invariants in dimension n=2 are hypersurface singularities, with an equation of a form similar to the form found by Artin when p=2. In higher dimension, the rings of invariants are not local complete intersection in general, but remain quasi-Gorenstein. We establish several structure results for such actions and their corresponding rings of invariants. "
"In this work, a study of the average transverse momentum (pt) as a function of the mid-rapidity charged hadron multiplicity (Nch) and hadron mass (m) in p-Pb and Pb-Pb collisions at LHC energies is presented. For the events producing low Nch, the average pt is found to scale with the reduced hadron mass, i.e., mass divided by the number of quark constituents (m/nq), this scaling also holds for inelastic pp collisions at RHIC and LHC energies. The scaling is broken in high multiplicity p-Pb and Pb-Pb collisions, where, for <Nch/deta> < 60 the average pt is higher for baryons than that for mesons, though they increase linearly with m/nq. This behavior is qualitatively well reproduced by Pythia 8, but not by hydro calculations, where an universal scaling with the hadron mass (and not with m/nq) is predicted for all the multiplicity event classes. Only the central (0-60%) Pb-Pb collisions behave as expected from hydro. "
"We show the consistency of ""there is a nice sigma --ideal I on the reals with add(I)= omega_1 which cannot be represented as the union of a strictly increasing sequence of length omega_1 of sigma-subideals"". This answers a question by Borodulin-Nadzieja and Glab. "
"We investigate the transient electronic structure of BaFe2As2, a parent compound of iron-based superconductors, by time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. In order to probe the entire Brillouin zone, we utilize extreme ultraviolet photons and observe photoemission intensity oscillation with the frequency of the A1g phonon which is antiphase between the zone-centered hole Fermi surfaces (FSs) and zone-cornered electron FSs. We attribute the antiphase behavior to the warping in one of the zone-centered hole FSs accompanying the displacement of the pnictogen height, and find that this displacement is the same direction as that induced by substitution of P for As, where superconductivity is induced by a structural modification without carrier doping in this system.

"We consider how the Pad'e-Borel, Pad'e-Borel-Leroy, and conformal mapping summation methods for asymptotic series can be used to calculate the dynamical critical exponent for homogeneous and disordered Ising-like systems. "
"Using recently proposed soliton equations we derive a basic identity for the scaling violation of $N=2$ supersymmetric gauge theories $\sum_i a_i\partial F/\partial a_i-2F=8 \pi i b_1 u$. Here $F$ is the prepotential, $a_i$'s are the expectation values of the scalar fields in the vector multiplet, $u=1/2\, {\rm Tr}\, \langle\phi^2\rangle$ and $b_1$ is the coefficient of the one-loop $\beta$-function. This equation holds in the Coulomb branch of all $N=2$ supersymmetric gauge theories coupled with massless matter. "
"The Big Bang predicted theoretically by Friedmann could not be discovered in the 1920th, since global cosmological distances (more than 300-1000 Mpc) were not available for observations at that time. In 1927-29, Lema\^itre and Hubble studied receding motions of galaxies at local distances of less than 20-30 Mpc and found that the motions followed the (nearly) linear velocity-distance relation, known now as Hubble's law. For decades, the real nature of this phenomenon has remained a mystery, in Sandage's words. After the discovery of dark energy, it was suggested that the dynamics of local expansion flows is dominated by omnipresent dark energy, and it is the dark energy antigravity that is able to introduce the linear velocity-distance relation to the flows. It implies that Hubble's law observed at local distances was in fact the first observational manifestation of dark energy. If this is the case, the commonly accepted criteria of scientific discovery lead to the conclusion: In 1927, Lema\^itre discovered dark energy and Hubble confirmed this in 1929. "
"Consider a random walk in a uniformly elliptic i.i.d. random environment in dimensions $d\ge 2$. In 2002, Sznitman introduced for each $\gamma\in (0,1)$ the ballisticity conditions $(T)_\gamma$ and $(T'),$ the latter being defined as the fulfilment of $(T)_\gamma$ for all $\gamma\in (0,1).$ He proved that $(T')$ implies ballisticity and that for each $\gamma\in (0.5,1),$ $(T)_\gamma$ is equivalent to $(T')$. It is conjectured that this equivalence holds for all $\gamma\in (0,1).$ Here we prove that for $\gamma\in (\gamma_d,1),$ where $\gamma_d$ is a dimension dependent constant taking values in the interval $(0.366,0.388),$ $(T)_\gamma$ is equivalent to $(T').$ This is achieved by a detour along the effective criterion, the fulfilment of which we establish by a combination of techniques developed by Sznitman giving a control on the occurrence of atypical quenched exit distributions through boxes. "
We perform a convergence analysis of a two-grid staggered solution algorithm for the Biot system modeling coupled flow and deformation in heterogeneous poroelastic media. The algorithm first solves the flow subproblem on a fine grid using a mixed finite element method (by freezing a certain measure of the mean stress) followed by the poromechanics subproblem on a coarse grid using a conforming Galerkin method. Restriction operators map the fine scale flow solution to the coarse scale poromechanical grid and prolongation operators map the coarse scale poromechanical solution to the fine scale flow grid. The coupling iterations are repeated until convergence and Backward Euler is employed for time marching. The analysis is based on studying the equations satisfied by the difference of iterates to show that the two-grid scheme is a contraction map under certain conditions. Those conditions are used to construct the restriction and prolongation operators as well as arrive at coarse scale elastic properties in terms of the fine scale data. We show that the adjustable parameter in the measure of the mean stress is linked to the Voigt and Reuss bounds frequently encountered in computational homogenization of multiphase composites.
Let $D$ be a large category which is cocomplete. We construct a model structure (in the sense of Quillen) on the category of small functors from $D$ to simplicial sets. As an application we construct homotopy localization functors on the category of simplicial sets which satisfy a stronger universal property than the customary homotopy localization functors do.
"The effects of plateau width and step edge kinking on carbon monoxide (CO)-induced restructuring of platinum surfaces were explored using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Platinum crystals displaying four different vicinal surfaces [(321), (765), (112), and (557)] were constructed and exposed to partial coverages of carbon monoxide. Platinum-CO interactions were fit to recent experimental data and density functional theory (DFT) calculations, providing a classical interaction model that captures the atop binding preference on Pt. The differences in Pt-Pt binding strength between edge atoms on the various facets were found to play a significant role in step edge wandering and reconstruction events. Because the mechanism for step doubling relies on a stochastic meeting of two wandering edges, the widths of the plateaus on the original surfaces was also found to play a role in these reconstructions. On the Pt(321) surfaces, the CO adsorbate was found to assist in reordering the kinked step edges into straight {100} edge segments. "
"Half-life of proton radioactivity of spherical proton emitters is studied within the scheme of covariant density functional (CDF) theory, and for the first time the potential barrier that prevents the emitted proton is extracted with the similarity renormalization group (SRG) method, in which the spin-orbit potential along with the others that turn out to be non-negligible can be derived automatically. The spectroscopic factor that is significant is also extracted from the CDF calculations. The estimated half-lives are found in good agreement with the experimental values, which not only confirms the validity of the CDF theory in describing the proton-rich nuclei, but also indicates the prediction power of present approach to calculate the half-lives and in turn to extract the structural information of proton emitters. "
"This paper provides comprehensive coding and outer bound for the half-duplex multiple access channel with generalized feedback (MAC-GF). Two users communicate with one destination over a discrete memoryless channel using time division. Each transmission block is divided into 3 time slots with variable durations: the destination is always in receive mode, while each user alternatively transmits and receives during the first 2 time slots, then both cooperate to send information during the last one. The paper proposes two decode-forward based coding schemes, analyzes their rate regions, and also derives two outer bounds with rate constraints similar to the achievable regions. Both schemes requires no block Makovity, allowing the destination to decode at the end of each block without any delay. In the first scheme, the codewords in the third time slot are superimposed on the codewords of the first two, whereas in the second scheme, these codewords are independent. While the second scheme is simpler, the first scheme helps emphasize the importance of joint decoding over separate decoding among multiple time slots at the destination. For the Gaussian channel, the two schemes with joint decoding are equivalent, as are the two outer bounds. For physically degraded Gaussian channels, the proposed schemes achieve the capacity. Extension to the m-user half-duplex MAC-GF are provided. Numerical results for the Gaussian channel shows significant rate region improvement over the classical MAC and that the outer bound becomes increasingly tight as the inter-user link quality increases "
"We consider the minimum of a super-critical branching random walk. Addario-Berry and Reed [Ann. Probab. 37 (2009) 1044-1079] proved the tightness of the minimum centered around its mean value. We show that a convergence in law holds, giving the analog of a well-known result of Bramson [Mem. Amer. Math. Soc. 44 (1983) iv+190] in the case of the branching Brownian motion. "
"Two-magnon Raman scattering provides important information about electronic correlations in the insulating parent compounds of high-$T_c$ materials. Recent experiments have shown a strong dependence of the Raman signal in $B_{1g}$ geometry on the frequency of the incoming photon. We present an analytical and numerical study of the Raman intensity in the resonant regime. It has been previously argued by one of us (A.Ch) and D. Frenkel that the most relevant contribution to the Raman vertex at resonance is given by the triple resonance diagram. We derive an expression for the Raman intensity in which we simultaneously include the enhancement due to the triple resonance and a final state interaction. We compute the two-magnon peak height (TMPH) as a function of incident frequency and find two maxima at $\omega^{(1)}_{res} \approx 2\Delta + 3J$ and $\omega^{(2)}_{res} \approx 2\Delta + 8J$. We argue that the high-frequency maximum is cut only by a quasiparticle damping, while the low-frequency maximum has a finite amplitude even in the absence of damping. We also obtain an evolution of the Raman profile from an asymmetric form around $\omega^{(1)}_{res}$ to a symmetric form around $\omega^{(2)}_{res}$. We further show that the TMPH depends on the fermionic quasiparticle damping, the next-nearest neighbor hopping term $t^{\prime}$ and the corrections to the interaction vertex between light and the fermionic current. We discuss our results in the context of recent experiments by Blumberg et al. on $Sr_2CuO_2Cl_2$ and $YBa_2Cu_3O_{6.1}$ and R\""{u}bhausen et al. on $PrBa_2Cu_3O_7$ and show that the triple resonance theory yields a qualitative and to some extent also quantitative understanding of the experimental data.

"Mason's Conjecture asserts that for an $m$--element rank $r$ matroid $\M$ the sequence $(I_k/\binom{m}{k}: 0\leq k\leq r)$ is logarithmically concave, in which $I_k$ is the number of independent $k$--sets of $\M$. A related conjecture in probability theory implies these inequalities provided that the set of independent sets of $\M$ satisfies a strong negative correlation property we call the \emph{Rayleigh condition}. This condition is known to hold for the set of bases of a regular matroid. We show that if $\omega$ is a weight function on a set system $\Q$ that satisfies the Rayleigh condition then $\Q$ is a convex delta--matroid and $\omega$ is logarithmically submodular. Thus, the hypothesis of the probabilistic conjecture leads inevitably to matroid theory. We also show that two--sums of matroids preserve the Rayleigh condition in four distinct senses, and hence that the Potts model of an iterated two--sum of uniform matroids satisfies the Rayleigh condition. Numerous conjectures and auxiliary results are included. "
"Multipartite pure states are equivalent under Stochastic Local Operations and Classical Communication (SLOCC) whenever they can be mapped into one another by Invertible Local Operations. It is shown that this is equivalent to the inter-convertibility through finite sequences of Elementary Local Operations. A multipartite version of the Gauss-Jordan elimination strategy is then obtained, enabling the analytical SLOCC-classification of previously unknown examples. It is argued that the problem of SLOCC-classification is equivalent to the problem of classifying the Multipartite Fully Reduced Forms that the coefficient matrix of a state can assume after being subjected to this Gauss-Jordan elimination procedure. The method is applied to examples of so-called LME and hypergraph states, showing new SLOCC-equivalences. Moreover, possible physical implications for states with a Dicke-like structure are sketched. "
"Motivated in part by a problem of combinatorial optimization and in part by analogies with quantum computations, we consider approximations of orthogonal matrices U by ``non-commutative convex combinations'' A of permutation matrices of the type A=sum A_sigma sigma, where sigma are permutation matrices and A_sigma are positive semidefinite nxn matrices summing up to the identity matrix. We prove that for every nxn orthogonal matrix U there is a non-commutative convex combination A of permutation matrices which approximates U entry-wise within an error of c n^{-1/2}ln n and in the Frobenius norm within an error of c ln n. The proof uses a certain procedure of randomized rounding of an orthogonal matrix to a permutation matrix. "
"We argue that there is a spontaneously broken rotational symmetry between space-time coordinates and gauge theoretical phases. The dilatonic mode acts as the massive Higgs boson, whose vacuum expectation value determines the gauge couplings. This mechanism requires that the quadratic divergences, or tadpoles of the three gauge-theory couplings, unify at a certain scale. We verify this statement, and find that this occurs at \Lambda_u ~ 4x10^7 GeV. The tadpole cancellation condition, together with the dilaton self-energy, fixes the value of the unified tadpole coefficient to be 1/[4 ln(\Lambda_cut/\Lambda_u)]. The observed values of the coupling constants at \Lambda_u then implies \Lambda_cut ~ 4x10^18 GeV, which is close to the value of the reduced Planck mass MR_Pl=M_Pl/sqrt(8 pi)=2.4 x 10^18 GeV. In other words, by assuming a cutoff at M_Pl or MR_Pl, we are able to obtain predictions for the gauge couplings which agree with the true values to within a few percent. It turns out that this symmetry breaking can only take place if mass is generated with the aid of some other means such as electroweak symmetry breaking. Assuming dynamical symmetry breaking originating at MR_Pl, we obtain M_chi ~ 10^9 GeV, which is not unreasonable but somewhat higher than \Lambda_u. The cancellation of an anomaly in the dilaton self-energy requires that the number of fermionic generations equals three. "
"In this work, we study the tensor ring decomposition and its associated numerical algorithms. We establish a sharp transition of algorithmic difficulty of the optimization problem as the bond dimension increases: On one hand, we show the existence of spurious local minima for the optimization energy landscape even when the tensor ring format is much over-parameterized, i.e., with bond dimension much larger than that of the true target tensor. On the other hand, when the bond dimension is further increased, we establish one-loop convergence for alternating least square algorithm for tensor ring decomposition. The theoretical results are complemented by numerical experiments for both local minimum and one-loop convergence for the alternating least square algorithm. "
"In this work we present Cutting Plane Inference (CPI), a Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) inference method for Statistical Relational Learning. Framed in terms of Markov Logic and inspired by the Cutting Plane Method, it can be seen as a meta algorithm that instantiates small parts of a large and complex Markov Network and then solves these using a conventional MAP method. We evaluate CPI on two tasks, Semantic Role Labelling and Joint Entity Resolution, while plugging in two different MAP inference methods: the current method of choice for MAP inference in Markov Logic, MaxWalkSAT, and Integer Linear Programming. We observe that when used with CPI both methods are significantly faster than when used alone. In addition, CPI improves the accuracy of MaxWalkSAT and maintains the exactness of Integer Linear Programming. "
"In the exact renormalization group (RG) flow in the infrared cutoff $\Lambda$ one needs boundary conditions. In a previous paper on $SU(2)$ Yang-Mills theory we proposed to use the nine physical relevant couplings of the effective action as boundary conditions at the physical point $\Lambda=0$ (these couplings are defined at some non-vanishing subtraction point $\mu \ne 0$). In this paper we show perturbatively that it is possible to appropriately fix these couplings in such a way that the full set of Slavnov-Taylor (ST) identities are satisfied. Three couplings are given by the vector and ghost wave function normalization and the three vector coupling at the subtraction point; three of the remaining six are vanishing (\eg the vector mass) and the others are expressed by irrelevant vertices evaluated at the subtraction point. We follow the method used by Becchi to prove ST identities in the RG framework. There the boundary conditions are given at a non-physical point $\Lambda=\Lambda' \ne 0$, so that one avoids the need of a non-vanishing subtraction point. "
"Continuum mechanics with dislocations, with the Cattaneo type heat conduction, with mass transfer, and with electromagnetic fields is put into the Hamiltonian form and into the form of the Godunov type system of the first order, symmetric hyperbolic partial differential equations (SHTC equations). The compatibility with thermodynamics of the time reversible part of the governing equations is mathematically expressed in the former formulation as degeneracy of the Hamiltonian structure and in the latter formulation as the existence of a companion conservation law. In both formulations the time irreversible part represents gradient dynamics. The Godunov type formulation brings the mathematical rigor (the well-posedness of the Cauchy initial value problem) and the possibility to discretize while keeping the physical content of the governing equations (the Godunov finite volume discretization).

Binary representations of the trefoil and other knots of up to ten crossings in the simple cubic lattice were created. The BiEntropy of each knot was computed using a variety of binary encodings and compared against controls. This showed that binary encoded knots are highly disordered information objects. The BiEntropy of knots on the simple cubic lattice increases slightly as the number of crossings and length of encoding increases. We show that the non-alternating knots of nine and ten crossings are more disordered than the alternating knots of nine and ten crossings.
"We use scanning gate microscopy to map out the trajectories of ballistic carriers in high-mobility graphene encapsulated by hexagonal boron nitride and subject to a weak magnetic field. We employ a magnetic focusing geometry to image carriers that emerge ballistically from an injector, follow a cyclotron path due to the Lorentz force from an applied magnetic field, and land on an adjacent collector probe. The local electric field generated by the scanning tip in the vicinity of the carriers deflects their trajectories, modifying the proportion of carriers focused into the collector. By measuring the voltage at the collector while scanning the tip, we are able to obtain images with arcs that are consistent with the expected cyclotron motion. We also demonstrate that the tip can be used to redirect misaligned carriers back to the collector. "
"A classical microscopic theory of rovibrational motion at high angular momenta in symmetrical non-linear molecules AB$_2$ is derived within the framework of small oscillations near the stationary states of a rotating molecule. The full-dimensional analysis including stretching vibrations has confirmed the existence of the bifurcation predicted previously by means of the rigid-bender model. The formation of fourfold energy clusters has already been experimentally verified for H$_2$Se and it has been demonstrated in fully-dimensional quantum mechanical calculations using the MORBID computer program. We show in the present work that apart from the level clustering, the bifurcation produces physically important effects including molecular symmetry-breaking and a transition from the normal mode to the local mode limit for the stretching vibrations due to rovibrational interaction. The application of the present theory with realistic molecular potentials to the H$_2$Te, H$_2$Se and H$_2$S hydrides results in predictions of the bifurcation points very close to those calculated previously. However for the lighter H$_2$O molecule we find that the bifurcation occurs at higher values of the total angular momentum than obtained in previous estimations. The present work shows it to be very unlikely that the bifurcation in H$_2$O will lead to clustering of energy levels. This result is in agreement with recent variational calculations. "
"The Sivers function describes the correlation between the transverse spin of a nucleon and the transverse motion of its partons. It was extracted from measurements of the azimuthal asymmetry of hadrons produced in semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering of leptons off transversely polarised nucleon targets, and it turned out to be non-zero for quarks. In this letter the evaluation of the Sivers asymmetry for gluons in the same process is presented. The analysis method is based on a Monte Carlo simulation that includes three hard processes: photon-gluon fusion, QCD Compton scattering and leading-order virtual-photon absorption process. The Sivers asymmetries of the three processes are simultaneously extracted using the LEPTO event generator and a neural network approach. The method is applied to samples of events containing at least two hadrons with large transverse momentum from the COMPASS data taken with a 160 GeV/$c$ muon beam scattered off transversely polarised deuterons and protons. With a significance of more than two standard deviations a negative value is obtained for the gluon Sivers asymmetry. The result of a similar analysis for a Collins-like asymmetry for gluons is consistent with zero. "
"Extra-solar planet search programs require high-precision velocity measurements. They need to study how to disentangle radial-velocity variations due to Doppler motion from the noise induced by stellar activity. We monitored the active K2V star HD 189733 and its transiting planetary companion that has a 2.2-day orbital period. We used the high-resolution spectograph SOPHIE mounted on the 1.93-m telescope at the Observatoire de Haute-Provence to obtain 55 spectra of HD 189733 over nearly two months. We refined the HD 189733b orbit parameters and put limits on the eccentricity and on a long-term velocity gradient. After subtracting the orbital motion of the planet, we compared the variability of spectroscopic activity indices to the evolution of the radial-velocity residuals and the shape of spectral lines. The radial velocity, the spectral-line profile and the activity indices measured in HeI (5875.62 \AA), Halpha (6562.81 \AA) and the CaII H&K lines (3968.47 \AA and 3933.66 \AA, respectively) show a periodicity around the stellar rotation period and the correlations between them are consistent with a spotted stellar surface in rotation. We used such correlations to correct for the radial-velocity jitter due to stellar activity. This results in achieving high precision on the orbit parameters, with a semi-amplitude K = 200.56 \pm 0.88 m.s-1 and a derived planet mass of M_{P}=1.13 \pm 0.03 M$_{Jup}$. "
"We present a drift scan survey covering a ~5 deg by 50 deg region toward the southern portion of the Taurus-Auriga molecular cloud. Data taken in the B,R,I filters with the Quest-2 camera on the Palomar 48-inch telescope were combined with 2MASS near-infrared photometry to select candidate young stars. Follow-up optical spectroscopy of 190 candidates led to identification of 42 new low mass pre-main sequence stars with spectral types M4-M8, of which approximately half exhibit surface gravity signatures similar to known Taurus stars while the other half exhibit surface gravity signatures similar to members of the somewhat older Upper Sco, TW Hya and Beta Pic associations. The pre-main sequence stars are spread over ~35 deg, and many are located well outside of previously explored regions. From assessment of the spatial and proper motion distributions, we argue that the new pre-main sequence stars identified far from the clouds cannot have originated from the vicinity of the 1-2 Myr-old subclusters which contain the bulk of the identified Taurus members, but instead represent a newly-identified area of recent star-formation near the clouds. "
"A self-consistent Quasiparticle-Random-Phase-Approximation (QRPA) model which employs the canonical Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) basis and an energy-density functional with a Skyrme mean field part and a density-dependent pairing, is used to study the monopole collective excitations of spherical even-even nuclei. The influence of the spurious state on the strength function of the isoscalar monopole excitations is clearly assessed. We compare the effect of different kinds of pairing forces (volume pairing, surface pairing and mixed pairing) on the monopole excitation strength function. The energy of the Isoscalar Giant Monopole Resonance (ISGMR), which is related to the nuclear incompressibility $K_{\infty}$, is calculated for tin isotopes and the results are discussed. "
"Consider a dataset of vector-valued observations that consists of noisy inliers, which are explained well by a low-dimensional subspace, along with some number of outliers. This work describes a convex optimization problem, called REAPER, that can reliably fit a low-dimensional model to this type of data. This approach parameterizes linear subspaces using orthogonal projectors, and it uses a relaxation of the set of orthogonal projectors to reach the convex formulation. The paper provides an efficient algorithm for solving the REAPER problem, and it documents numerical experiments which confirm that REAPER can dependably find linear structure in synthetic and natural data. In addition, when the inliers lie near a low-dimensional subspace, there is a rigorous theory that describes when REAPER can approximate this subspace. "
"Using finite size scaling and histogram methods we obtain numerical results from lattice simulations indicating the logarithmic triviality of scalar quantum electrodynamics, even when the bare gauge coupling is chosen large. Simulations of the non-compact formulation of the lattice abelian Higgs model with fixed length scalar fields on $L^{4}$ lattices with $L$ ranging from $6$ through $20$ indicate a line of second order critical points. Fluctuation-induced first order transitions are ruled out. Runs of over ten million sweeps for each $L$ produce specific heat peaks which grow logarithmically with $L$ and whose critical couplings shift with $L$ picking out a correlation length exponent of $0.50(5)$ consistent with mean field theory. This behavior is qualitatively similar to that found in pure $\lambda\phi^{4}$. "
"The failure of the XMM-Newton and Chandra X-ray telescopes to detect cooling gas in elliptical galaxies and clusters of galaxies has led many to adopt the position that the gas is not cooling at all and that heating by an active nucleus in the central E or cD galaxy is sufficient to offset radiative cooling. In this paper we explore an idealized limiting example of this point of view in which hot, buoyant bubbles formed near the center return the inflowing, radiatively cooling gas to distant regions in the flow. We show that idealized steady state, centrally heated non-cooling flows can indeed be constructed. In addition, the emission-weighted temperature profiles in these circulating flows resemble those of normal cooling flows. However, these solutions are valid only (1) for a range of bubble parameters for which there is no independent justification, (2) for a limited spatial region in the cooling flow and (3) for a limited period of time after which cooling seems inevitable. Our exploration of non-cooling flows is set in the context of galaxy/group flows. "
"The size of the emission volume of pions and kaons, r_{\pi\pi} and r_{KK}, were measured in the hadronic Z^0 decays through the two-pion and two-kaon Bose-Einstein correlations near threshold. Recently the emitter size of the two identical baryons, \Lambda \Lambda (\bar \Lambda \bar \Lambda), was evaluated from the dependence of the fraction of the spin S=1 state on the energy near threshold where it is affected by the Pauli exclusion principle. Here we show that the r dependence on the particle masses, namely the hierarchy r_{\pi\pi} > r_{KK} > r_{\Lambda \Lambda} observed in the Z^0 hadronic decays, is well described in terms of the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. A good description can also be obtained via the virial theorem when applied to a general QCD potential. Other available approaches are also discussed. "
The discrete cocompact subgroups of the 5-dimensional Lie group G_53 are determined up to isomorphism. Each of their group C*-algebras is studied by determining all of its simple infinite dimensional quotient C*-algebras. The K-groups and trace invariants of the latter are also obtained.
"The effect of fluctuating internal viscosity and hydrodynamic interactions on a range of rheological properties of dilute polymer solutions is examined using a finitely extensible dumbbell model for a polymer. Brownian dynamics simulations are used to compute both transient and steady state viscometric functions in shear flow. The results enable a careful differentiation of the influence, on rheological properties, of solvent-mediated friction from that of a dissipative mechanism that is independent of solvent viscosity. In particular, hydrodynamic interactions have a significant influence on the magnitude of the stress jump at the inception of shear flow, and on the transient viscometric functions, but a negligible effect on the steady state viscometric functions at high shear rates. Zero-shear rate viscometric functions of free-draining dumbbells remain essentially independent of the internal viscosity parameter, as predicted by the Gaussian approximation, but the inclusion of hydrodynamic interactions induces a dependence on both the hydrodynamic interaction and the internal viscosity parameter. Large values of the internal viscosity parameter lead to linear viscoelastic predictions that mimic the behavior of rigid dumbbell solutions. On the other hand, steady-shear viscometric functions at high shear rates differ in general from those for rigid dumbbells, depending crucially on the finite extensibility of the dumbbell spring. "
"The stack calculus is a functional language in which is in a Curry-Howard correspondence with classical logic. It enjoys confluence but, as well as Parigot's lambda-mu, does not admit the Bohm Theorem, typical of the lambda-calculus. We present a simple extension of stack calculus which is for the stack calculus what Saurin's Lambda-mu is for lambda-mu. "
"This paper presents end-to-end learning from spectrum data - an umbrella term for new sophisticated wireless signal identification approaches in spectrum monitoring applications based on deep neural networks. End-to-end learning allows to (i) automatically learn features directly from simple wireless signal representations, without requiring design of hand-crafted expert features like higher order cyclic moments, and (ii) train wireless signal classifiers in one end-to-end step which eliminates the need for complex multi-stage machine learning processing pipelines. The purpose of this article is to present the conceptual framework of end-to-end learning for spectrum monitoring and systematically introduce a generic methodology to easily design and implement wireless signal classifiers. Furthermore, we investigate the importance of the choice of wireless data representation to various spectrum monitoring tasks. In particular, two case studies are elaborated (i) modulation recognition and (ii) wireless technology interference detection. For each case study three convolutional neural networks are evaluated for the following wireless signal representations: temporal IQ data, the amplitude/phase representation and the frequency domain representation. From our analysis we prove that the wireless data representation impacts the accuracy depending on the specifics and similarities of the wireless signals that need to be differentiated, with different data representations resulting in accuracy variations of up to 29%. Experimental results show that using the amplitude/phase representation for recognizing modulation formats can lead to performance improvements up to 2% and 12% for medium to high SNR compared to IQ and frequency domain data, respectively. For the task of detecting interference, frequency domain representation outperformed amplitude/phase and IQ data representation up to 20%. "
"We study the first-order $\alpha'$ corrections to the singular 4-dimensional massless stringy black holes studied in the nineties in the context of the Heterotic Superstring. We show that the $\alpha'$ corrections not only induce a non-vanishing mass and give rise to an event horizon, but also eliminate the singularity giving rise to a regular spacetime whose global structure includes further asymptotically flat regions in which the spacetime's mass is positive or negative. We study the timelike and null geodesics and their effective potential, showing that the spacetime is geodesically complete. We discuss the validity of this solution, arguing that the very interesting and peculiar properties of the solution are associated to the negative energy contributions coming from the terms quadratic in the curvature. As a matter of fact, the 10-dimensional configuration is singular. We extract some general lessons on attempts to eliminate black-hole singularities by introducing terms of higher order in the curvature. "
"The second Stokes problem about behavior of the viscous fluid (matter) filling half-space is considered. A flat surface limiting half-space makes harmonious oscillations in the eigen plane. The equations of mechanics of the continuous environment are used. It is shown, that in considered process there is the temperature difference between temperature of a surface and temperature environments far from a surface. Usually similar difference is called as temperature jump. The method of small parameter is applied. Temperature jump in the second approach is found out. "
"This paper summarises the current state-of-the art in the study of compositionality in distributional semantics, and major challenges for this area. We single out generalised quantifiers and intensional semantics as areas on which to focus attention for the development of the theory. Once suitable theories have been developed, algorithms will be needed to apply the theory to tasks. Evaluation is a major problem; we single out application to recognising textual entailment and machine translation for this purpose. "
"We describe a simple experimental implementation of the Malkus-Lorenz water wheel. We demonstrate that both chaotic and periodic behavior is found as wheel parameters are changed in agreement with predictions from the Lorenz model. We furthermore show that when the measured angular velocity of our water wheel is used as an input signal to a computer model implementing the Lorenz equations, high quality chaos synchronization of the model and the water wheel is achieved. This indicates that the Lorenz equations provide a good description of the water wheel dynamics. "
"In [22] a form of extremum seeking for control (ESC) was developed for the stabilization of uncertain nonlinear systems. In ESC the extremum seeker itself controls the systems through feedback rather than fine tuning a controller. The ESC results, and other related results, apply only to systems affine in control. However, in most physical systems the control effort enters the system's dynamics through a nonlinear function, such as an input with deadline and saturation. In this work, we utilize our previous results on ESC to develop stabilizing controllers for systems of practical interest that are non-affine in control. "
"The QCD factorization (QCDF) method usually contains infrared divergences which introduce large model dependence to its predictions on charmless B decays. The amplitudes of charmless B decays can be decomposed into ""tree"" and ""penguin"" parts which are conventionally defined, not from the topology of the dominant diagrams, but through their associated CKM factors V_{ub}^* V_{uq} and V_{tb}^* V_{tq}, respectively, with q=d,s. We find that for B_{d,s} \to \pi^+ K^- decays, the ""tree"" amplitude can be well estimated in QCDF with small errors, as the endpoint singularities have been canceled to a large extent. With this as the only input from QCDF and combined with flavor symmetry, the branching ratio of B_s \to \pi^+ K^- are estimated to be significantly larger than the CDF measurement. This contradiction could be solved if the form factor F^{B_s K} is smaller than the light cone sum rules estimation or the ""tree"" amplitude has been over estimated in QCDF. The latter possibility could happen if charming penguins are nonperturbative and not small, as argued in soft collinear effective theory. To differentiate between these two possibilities, we examine the similar B_s \to \rho^+ K^- decay with the same technique. It is found that a large part of the uncertainties are canceled in the ratio B(B_s \to \rho^+ K^-)/B(B_s \to \pi^+ K^-). It is predicted to be 2.5 \pm 0.2 in QCDF which is independent on the form factor. However if charming penguins are important, this ratio could be very different from the QCDF prediction. Therefore the ratio of these two branching ratios could be an interesting indicator of the role of charming penguins in charmless B decays. "
We obtain large deviations theorems for nonconventional sums with underlying process being a Markov process satisfying the Doeblin condition or a dynamical system such as subshift of finite type or hyperbolic or expanding transformation.
"In an earlier paper, we proved that given an asymptotically cylindrical G_2-manifold M with a Calabi-Yau boundary X, the moduli space of coassociative deformations of an asymptotically cylindrical coassociative 4-fold C in M with a fixed special Lagrangian boundary L in X is a smooth manifold of dimension dim(V_+), where V_+ is the positive subspace of the image of H^2_{cs}(C,R) in H^2(C,R). In order to prove this we used the powerful tools of Fredholm Theory for noncompact manifolds which was developed by Lockhart and McOwen, and independently by Melrose. In this paper, we extend our result to the moving boundary case. Let Upsilon:H^2(L,R)--> H^3_{cs}(C,R) be the natural projection, so that ker(Upsilon) is a vector subspace of H^2(L,R). Let F be a small open neighbourhood of 0 in ker(Upsilon) and L_s denote the special Lagrangian submanifolds of X near L for some s in F and with phase i. Here we prove that the moduli space of coassociative deformations of an asymptotically cylindrical coassociative submanifold C asymptotic to L_s x (R,infinity), s in F, is a smooth manifold of dimension equal to dim V_++dim(ker(Upsilon))=dim V_+ +b^2(L)-b^0(L)+b^3(C)-b^1(C)+b^0(C). "
"This paper considers the practically important case of nonparametrically estimating heterogeneous average treatment effects that vary with a limited number of discrete and continuous covariates in a selection-on-observables framework where the number of possible confounders is very large. We propose a two-step estimator for which the first step is estimated by machine learning. We show that this estimator has desirable statistical properties like consistency, asymptotic normality and rate double robustness. In particular, we derive the coupled convergence conditions between the nonparametric and the machine learning steps. We also show that estimating population average treatment effects by averaging the estimated heterogeneous effects is semi-parametrically efficient. The new estimator is an empirical example of the effects of mothers' smoking during pregnancy on the resulting birth weight. "
"With the aid of the creation operators introduced in our previous works, we show how to construct a basis of the space of quasi-local operators for the homogeneous XXZ chain. "
"We investigate how to obtain various flows of K\""ahler metrics on a fixed manifold as variations of K\""ahler reductions of a metric satisfying a given static equation on a higher dimensional manifold. We identify static equations that induce the geodesic equation for the Mabuchi's metric, the Calabi flow, the pseudo-Calabi flow of Chen-Zheng and the K\""ahler-Ricci flow. In the latter case we re-derive the V-soliton equation of La Nave-Tian. "
"The formalism for treating the leading-twist contributions of the two-gluon Fock components occurring in hard exclusive processes that involve eta and eta' mesons is reviewed. The calculation of the eta, eta'--photon transition form factor in next-to-leading order in alpha_s, as well as, the analysis of the g* g* eta' vertex and the electro- and photoproduction of eta, eta' mesons are presented. Applications of this formalism to other relevant quantities such as glueballs are also discussed. "
"It is well-established that the vast majority of metal-poor Galactic halo stars shows evidence for enrichment by solely massive stars. Recent observations have identified more varied behavior in the pattern of elemental abundances measured for metal-rich, [Fe/H]=-1, halo stars, with both high and low values of the ratio of [alpha/Fe]. The low values are most naturally due to the incorporation of iron from Type Ia supernovae. These `low-alpha' halo stars have been interpreted as being accreted from dwarf galaxies. However, these stars are on very high-energy radial orbits, that plunge into the Galactic center, from the outer regions of the stellar halo. We demonstrate here that known dwarf galaxies could not reproduce the observations. Rather, the observations are consistent with fragmentation of a gaseous proto-halo into transient star-forming regions, some of which are sufficiently dense to survive close to the Galactic center, and self-enrich to relatively high metallicities. Those that probe the outer halo sustain star formation long enough to incorporate the ejecta from Type Ia supernovae. The values of the `Type II plateau' in the element ratios for disk stars and for halo stars are equal. This implies that the (massive) stars that enriched the early disk and halo had the same IMF. However, there is a discontinuity in the chemical enrichment history between the halo and disk, as probed by these samples, consistent with previous inferences based on angular momentum considerations. "
"Weakly chaotic or weakly interacting systems have a wide regime where the common random matrix theory modeling does not apply. As an example we consider cold atoms in a nearly integrable optical billiard with displaceable wall (""piston""). The motion is completely chaotic but with small Lyapunov exponent. The Hamiltonian matrix does not look like one taken from a Gaussian ensemble, but rather it is very sparse and textured. This can be characterized by parameters $s$ and $g$ that reflect the percentage of large elements, and their connectivity, respectively. For $g$ we use a resistor network calculation that has a direct relation to the semi-linear response characteristics of the system, hence leading to a novel prediction regarding the rate of heating of cold atoms in optical billiards with vibrating walls. "
"During its cycle-1 observation period, between April 2005 and March 2006, the MAGIC telescope was able to observe nine Gamma Ray Burst (GRB) events since their early beginning. Other observations were performed during the following months in the cycle-2 observation period. The observations, with an energy threshold spanning from 80 to 200 GeV, did not reveal any gamma ray emission. The computed upper limits are compatible with a power law extrapolation, where intrinsic fluxes are evaluated taking into account the attenuation due to the scattering in the metagalactic radiation field. "
"Vortex formation through the Rossby wave instability (RWI) in protoplanetary discs has been invoked to play a role in planet formation theory, and suggested to explain the observation of large dust asymmetries in several transitional discs. However, whether or not vortex formation operates in layered accretion discs, i.e. models of protoplanetary discs including dead zones near the disc midplane --- regions that are magnetically inactive and the effective viscosity greatly reduced --- has not been verified. As a first step toward testing the robustness of vortex formation in layered discs, we present non-linear hydrodynamical simulations of global 3D protoplanetary discs with an imposed kinematic viscosity that increases away from the disc midplane. Two sets of numerical experiments are performed: (i) non-axisymmetric instability of artificial radial density bumps in viscous discs; (ii) vortex-formation at planetary gap edges in layered discs. Experiment (i) shows that the linear instability is largely unaffected by viscosity and remains dynamical. The disc-planet simulations also show the initial development of vortices at gap edges, but in layered discs the vortices are transient structures which disappear well into the non-linear regime. We suggest that the long term survival of columnar vortices, such as those formed via the RWI, requires low effective viscosity throughout the vertical extent of the disc, so such vortices do not persist in layered discs. "
"We study the design of storage-efficient algorithms for emulating atomic shared memory over an asynchronous, distributed message-passing system. Our first algorithm is an atomic single-writer multi-reader algorithm based on a novel erasure-coding technique, termed \emph{multi-version code}. Next, we propose an extension of our single-writer algorithm to a multi-writer multi-reader environment. Our second algorithm combines replication and multi-version code, and is suitable in situations where we expect a large number of concurrent writes. Moreover, when the number of concurrent writes is bounded, we propose a simplified variant of the second algorithm that has a simple structure similar to the single-writer algorithm. Let $N$ be the number of servers, and the shared memory variable be of size 1 unit. Our algorithms have the following properties: (i) The write operation terminates if the number of server failures is bounded by a parameter $f$. The algorithms also guarantee the termination of the read as long as the number of writes concurrent with the read is smaller than a design parameter $\nu$, and the number of server failures is bounded by $f$. (ii) The overall storage size for the first algorithm, and the steady-state storage size for the second algorithm, are all $N/\lceil \frac{N-2f}{\nu} \rceil$ units. Moreover, our simplified variant of the second algorithm achieves the worst-case storage cost of $N/\lceil \frac{N-2f}{\nu} \rceil$, asymptotically matching a lower bound by Cadambe et al. for $N \gg f, \nu \le f+1$. (iii) The write and read operations only consist of a small number (2 to 3) of communication rounds. (iv) For all algorithms, the server maintains a simple data structure. A server only needs to store the information associated with the latest value it observes, similar to replication-based algorithms. "
"A modern processor can dynamically set it's speed while it's active, and can make a transition to sleep state when required. When the processor is operating at a speed $s$, the energy consumed per unit time is given by a convex power function $P(s)$ having the property that $P(0) > 0$ and $P""(s) > 0$ for all values of $s$. Moreover, $C > 0$ units of energy is required to make a transition from the sleep state to the active state. The jobs are specified by their arrival time, deadline and the processing volume. We consider a scheduling problem, called speed scaling with sleep state, where each job has to be scheduled within their arrival time and deadline, and the goal is to minimize the total energy consumption required to process these jobs. Albers et. al. proved the NP-hardness of this problem by reducing an instance of an NP-hard partition problem to an instance of this scheduling problem. The instance of this scheduling problem consists of the arrival time, the deadline and the processing volume for each of the jobs, in addition to $P$ and $C$. Since $P$ and $C$ depend on the instance of the partition problem, this proof of the NP-hardness of the speed scaling with sleep state problem doesn't remain valid when $P$ and $C$ are fixed. In this paper, we prove that the speed scaling with sleep state problem remains NP-hard for any fixed positive number $C$ and convex $P$ satisfying $P(0) > 0$ and $P""(s) > 0$ for all values of $s$.

"We study few properties of square-free integers in certain equations. Using this property, we derive some infinite products in powers of square free numbers. Also, we present a method, to convert power series and trigonometric series to infinte products. Infinite products of few elementary trigonometric functions and factorials for large numbers are shown as examples. "
"Perturbative solutions to the fourth-order gravity describing spherically-symmetric, static and electrically charged black hole in an asymptotically de Sitter universe is constructed and discussed. Special emphasis is put on the lukewarm configurations, in which the temperature of the event horizon equals the temperature of the cosmological horizon. "
"In this paper we review our previous isoperimetric results for the logarithmic potential and Newton potential operators. The main reason why the results are useful, beyond the intrinsic interest of geometric extremum problems, is that they produce a priori bounds for spectral invariants of operators on arbitrary domains. We demonstrate these in explicit examples. "
"Growth mixture models are an important tool for detecting group structure in repeated measures data. Unlike traditional clustering methods, they explicitly model the repeat measurements on observations, and the statistical framework they are based on allows for model selection methods to be used to select the number of clusters. However, the basic growth mixture model makes the assumption that all of the measurements in the data have grouping information/separate the clusters. In other clustering contexts, it has been shown that including non-clustering variables in clustering procedures can lead to poor estimation of the group structure both in terms of the number of clusters and cluster membership/parameters. In this paper, we present an extension of the growth mixture model that allows for incorporation of stepwise variable selection based on the work done by Maugis et al. (2009) and Raftery and Dean (2006). Results presented on a simulation study suggest that the method performs well in correctly selecting the clustering variables and improves on recovery of the cluster structure compared with the basic growth mixture model. The paper also presents an application of the model to a clinical study dataset and concludes with a discussion and suggestions for directions of future work in this area. "
"The anomalous Nernst effect (ANE)$-$the generation of a transverse electric voltage by a longitudinal heat current in conducting ferromagnets or antiferromagnets$-$is an appealing approach for thermoelectric power generation in spin caloritronics. The ANE in antiferromagnets is particularly convenient for the fabrication of highly efficient and densely integrated thermopiles as lateral configurations of thermoelectric modules increase the coverage of heat source without suffering from the stray fields that are intrinsic to ferromagnets. In this work, using first-principles calculations together with a group theory analysis, we systematically investigate the spin order-dependent ANE in noncollinear antiferromagnetic Mn-based antiperovskite nitrides Mn$_{3}X$N ($X$ = Ga, Zn, Ag, and Ni). The ANE in Mn$_{3}X$N is forbidden by symmetry in the R1 phase but amounts to its maximum value in the R3 phase. Among all Mn$_{3}X$N compounds, Mn$_{3}$NiN presents the most significant anomalous Nernst conductivity of 1.80 AK$^{-1}$m$^{-1}$ at 200 K, which can be further enhanced if strain, electric, or magnetic fields are applied. The ANE in Mn$_{3}$NiN, being one order of magnitude larger than that in the famous Mn$_{3}$Sn, is the largest one discovered in antiferromagnets so far. The giant ANE in Mn$_{3}$NiN originates from the sharp slope of the anomalous Hall conductivity at the Fermi energy, which can be understood well from the Mott relation. Our findings provide a novel host material for realizing antiferromagnetic spin caloritronics which promises exciting applications in energy conversion and information processing. "
"We carried out the direct measurement of the fraction of dusty sources in a sample of extremely red galaxies with (R - Ks) > 5.3mag and Ks < 20.2mag, using 24um data from the Spitzer Space Telescope. Combining deep 24um, Ks- and R-band data over an area of 64sq.arcmin in ELAIS N1, we find that 50%+-6% of our ERO sample have measurable 24um flux above the 3sigma flux limit of 40uJy. This flux limit corresponds to a SFR of 12Msun/yr at z~1. The 24um-detected EROs have 24-to-2.2 and 24-to-0.7um flux ratios consistent with infrared luminous, dusty sources at z>1, and an order of magnitude too red to be explained by an infrared quiescent spiral or a pure old stellar population at any redshift. Keck optical spectroscopy of a sample of similarly selected EROs in the FLS field suggests that most of the EROs in ELAIS N1 are probably at z~1. The mean 24um flux (167uJy) of the 24um-detected ERO sample roughly corresponds to the total infrared luminosity of (3-10)x10^(11)Lsun at z=1-1.5, which is similar to that of local LIRGs and ULIGs. The corresponding SFR is ~(50-170)Msun/yr. If the time scale of this starbursting phase is on the order of 10^8yr as inferred for the local LIRGs and ULIGs, the lower limit on the masses of these 24um-detected EROs is (5-20)x10^9Msun. It is plausible that some of the starburst EROs are in the midst of violent transformation to become massive early type galaxies at the epoch of z ~ 1-2. "
"Within an effective Dirac-Weyl theory we solve the scattering problem for massless chiral fermions impinging on a cylindrical time-dependent potential barrier. The set-up we consider can be used to model the electron propagation in a monolayer of graphene with harmonically driven quantum dots. For static small-sized quantum dots scattering resonances enable particle confinement and interference effects may switch forward scattering on and off. An oscillating dot may cause inelastic scattering by excitation of states with energies shifted by integer multiples of the oscillation frequency, which significantly modifies the scattering characteristics of static dots. Exemplarily the scattering efficiency of a potential barrier with zero bias remains finite in the limit of low particle energies and small potential amplitudes. For an oscillating quantum dot with finite bias, the partial wave resonances at higher energies are smeared out for small frequencies or large oscillation amplitudes, thereby dissolving the quasi-bound states at the quantum dot.

"Six high-resolution TiO-band image sequences from the New Vacuum Solar Telescope (NVST) are used to investigate the properties of intergranular bright points (igBPs). We detect the igBPs using a Laplacian and morphological dilation algorithm (LMD) and track them using a three-dimensional segmentation algorithm automatically, and then investigate the morphologic, photometric and dynamic properties of igBPs, in terms of equivalent diameter, the intensity contrast, lifetime, horizontal velocity, diffusion index, motion range and motion type. The statistical results confirm the previous studies based on G-band or TiO-band igBPs from the other telescopes. It illustrates that the TiO data from the NVST have a stable and reliable quality, which are suitable for studying the igBPs. In addition, our method is feasible to detect and track the igBPs in the TiO data from the NVST. With the aid of the vector magnetograms obtained from the Solar Dynamics Observatory /Helioseismic and Magnetic Imager, the properties of igBPs are found to be influenced by their embedded magnetic environments strongly. The area coverage, the size and the intensity contrast values of igBPs are generally larger in the regions with higher magnetic flux. However, the dynamics of igBPs, including the horizontal velocity, the diffusion index, the ratio of motion range and the index of motion type are generally larger in the regions with lower magnetic flux. It suggests that the absence of strong magnetic fields in the medium makes it possible for the igBPs to look smaller and weaker, diffuse faster, move faster and further in a straighter path. "
"We show that if a closed atoroidal 3-manifold M contains a genuine lamination, then it is group negatively curved in the sense of Gromov. Specifically, we exploit the structure of the non-product complementary regions of the genuine lamination and then apply the first author's Ubiquity Theorem to show that M satisfies a linear isoperimetric inequality. "
"We study the Pfaff lattice, introduced by us in the context of a Lie algebra splitting of gl(infinity) into sp(infinity) and lower-triangular matrices. We establish a set of bilinear identities, which we show to be equivalent to the Pfaff Lattice. In the semi-infinite case, the tau-functions are Pfaffians; interesting examples are the matrix integrals over symmetric matrices (symmetric matrix integrals) and matrix integrals over self-dual quaternionic Hermitean matrices (symplectic matrix integrals). There is a striking parallel of the Pfaff lattice with the Toda lattice, and more so, there is a map from one to the other. In particular, we exhibit two maps, dual to each other, (i) from the the Hermitean matrix integrals to the symmetric matrix integrals, and (ii) from the Hermitean matrix integrals to the symplectic matrix integrals. The map is given by the skew-Borel decomposition of a skew-symmetric operator. We give explicit examples for the classical weights. "
"We investigate the combination between causal/zero-delay source coding and information-theoretic secrecy. Two source coding models with secrecy constraints are considered. We start by considering zero-delay perfectly secret lossless transmission of a memoryless source. We derive bounds on the key rate and coding rate needed for perfect zero-delay secrecy. In this setting, we consider two models which differ by the ability of the eavesdropper to parse the bit-stream passing from the encoder to the legitimate decoder into separate messages. We also consider causal source coding with a fidelity criterion and side information at the decoder and the eavesdropper. Unlike the zero-delay setting where variable-length coding is traditionally used but might leak information on the source through the length of the codewords, in this setting, since delay is allowed, block coding is possible. We show that in this setting, separation of encryption and causal source coding is optimal. "
"We consider an $n$-tuple of independent ergodic Markov processes, each of which converges (in the sense of separation distance) at an exponential rate, and obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for the $n$-tuple to exhibit a separation cutoff. We also provide general bounds on the (asymmetric) window size of the cutoff, and indicate links to classical extreme value theory. "
"At separations below 100 nm, Casimir-Lifshitz forces strongly influence the actuation dynamics of micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) in dry vacuum conditions. For a micron size plate oscillating near a surface, which mimics a frequently used setup in experiments with MEMS, we show that the roughness of the surfaces significantly influences the qualitative dynamics of the oscillator. Via a combination of analytical and numerical methods, it is shown that surface roughness leads to a clear increase of initial conditions associated with chaotic motion, that eventually lead to stiction between the surfaces. Since stiction leads to malfunction of MEMS oscillators, our results are of central interest for the design of microdevices. Moreover, they are of significance for fundamentally motivated experiments performed with MEMS. "
"We present a detailed study of the temperature (T) and magnetic field (H) dependence of the electronic density of states (DOS) at the Fermi level, as deduced from specific heat and Knight shift measurements in underdoped YBa2Cu3Oy. We find that the DOS becomes field-independent above a characteristic field H_{DOS} and that the H_{DOS}(T) line displays an unusual inflection near the onset of the long range 3D charge-density wave order. The unusual S-shape of H_{DOS}(T) is suggestive of two mutually-exclusive orders that eventually establish a form of cooperation in order to coexist at low T. On theoretical grounds, such a collaboration could result from the stabilisation of a pair-density wave state, which calls for further investigations in this region of the phase diagram "
"We demonstrate existence of positive bound and ground states for a system of coupled nonlinear Schr\""odinger--Korteweg-de Vries equations. More precisely, we prove there is a positive radially symmetric ground state if either the coupling coefficient $\beta>\Lambda$ (for an appropriate constant $\Lambda>0$) or $\beta>0$ with appropriate conditions on the other parameters of the problem. Concerning bound states, we prove there exists a positive radially symmetric bound state if either $0<\beta$ is sufficiently small or $0<\beta<\Lambda$ with some appropriate conditions on the parameters as for the ground states. That results give a classification of positive solutions as well as multiplicity of positive solutions. Furthermore, we consider a system with more general power nonlinearities, proving the above results, and also we study natural extended systems with more than two equations. Although the techniques we employed are variational, we look for critical points of an energy functional different from the classical one used in this kind of systems. Our approach improves many of the previous known results, as well as permit us to show new results not considered or studied before. "
"Motivated by recent disagreements in the context of AdS/CFT, we study the non-planar sector of the BMN correspondence. In particular, we reconsider the energy shift of states with two stringy excitations in light-cone string field theory and explicitly determine its complete perturbative contribution from the impurity-conserving channel. Surprisingly, our result neither agrees with earlier leading order computations, nor reproduces the gauge theory prediction. More than that, it features half-integer powers of the effective gauge coupling $\lambda'$ representing a qualitative difference to gauge theory. Based on supersymmetry we argue that the above truncation is not suited for conclusive tests of the BMN duality. "
"We develop an analytical mode-matching technique for the tight-binding model to describe electron transport across graphene P-N junctions. This method shares the simplicity of the conventional mode-matching technique for the low-energy continuum model and the accuracy of the tight-binding model over a wide range of energies. It further reveals an interesting phenomenon on a sharp P-N junction: the disappearance of the well-known Klein tunneling (i.e., perfect transmission) at normal incidence and the appearance of perfect transmission at oblique incidence due to trigonal warping at energies beyond the linear Dirac regime. We show that this phenomenon arises from the conservation of a generalized pseudospin in the tight-binding model. We expect this effect to be experimentally observable in graphene and other Dirac fermions systems, such as the surface of three-dimensional topological insulators. "
"We present an empirical study of contamination in deep, rapid, and wide-field optical follow-up searches of GW sources from aLIGO. We utilize dedicated observations during four nights of imaging with DECam. Our search covered $\sim56$ deg$^2$, with two visits per night separated by $\approx 3$~hours, in $i$- and $z$-band, followed by an additional set of $griz$ images three weeks later to serve as reference images for subtraction, and for the purpose of identifying galaxy and stellar counterparts for any transient sources. We achieve $5\sigma$ point-source limiting magnitudes of $i \approx 23.5$ and $z \approx 22.4$ mag in the coadded single-epoch images. We conduct a search for transient objects that can mimic the $i-z$ color behavior of both red ($i-z > 0.5$~mag) and blue ($i-z < 0$~mag) kilonova emission, finding 11 and 10 contaminants, respectively. Independent of color, we identify 48 transients of interest. Additionally, we leverage the rapid cadence of our observations to search for sources with characteristic timescales of $\approx1$ day and $\approx3$ hours, finding no potential contaminants. We assess the efficiency of our pipeline and search methodology with injected point sources, finding that we are 90\% (60\%) efficient when searching for red (blue) kilonova-like sources to a limiting magnitude of $i \lesssim 22.5$ mag. Applying these efficiencies, we derive sky rates for kilonova contaminants in the red and blue regimes of $\mathcal{R}_{\rm red} \approx 0.16$ deg$^{-2}$ and $\mathcal{R}_{\rm blue} \approx 0.80$ deg$^{-2}$. The total contamination rate, independent of color, is $\mathcal{R}_{\rm all} \approx 1.79$ deg$^{-2}$. We compare our derived results to optical follow-up searches of the GW events GW150914 and GW151226 and comment on the outlook for GW follow-up searches as additional GW detectors (e.g., KAGRA, LIGO India) come online in the next decade.

"The Heisenberg exchange interaction between neighboring quantum dots allows precise voltage control over spin dynamics, due to the ability to precisely control the overlap of orbital wavefunctions by gate electrodes. This allows the study of fundamental electronic phenomena and finds applications in quantum information processing. Although spin-based quantum circuits based on short-range exchange interactions are possible, the development of scalable, longer-range coupling schemes constitutes a critical challenge within the spin-qubit community. Approaches based on capacitative coupling and cavity-mediated interactions effectively couple spin qubits to the charge degree of freedom, making them susceptible to electrically-induced decoherence. The alternative is to extend the range of the Heisenberg exchange interaction by means of a quantum mediator. Here, we show that a multielectron quantum dot with 50-100 electrons serves as an excellent mediator, preserving speed and coherence of the resulting spin-spin coupling while providing several functionalities that are of practical importance. These include speed (mediated two-qubit rates up to several gigahertz), distance (of order of a micrometer), voltage control, possibility of sweet spot operation (reducing susceptibility to charge noise), and reversal of the interaction sign (useful for dynamical decoupling from noise). "
"Let F be a p-adic field and let G(n) and G`(n) be the metaplectic double covers of the general symplectic group and symplectic group attached to a 2n dimensional symplectic space over F. We show here that if n is odd then all the genuine irreducible representations of G(n) are induced from a normal subgroup of finite index closely related to G`(n). Thus, we reduce, in this case, the theory of genuine admissible representations of G(n) to the better understood corresponding theory of G`(n). For odd n we also prove the uniqueness of certain Whittaker functionals along with Rodier type of Heredity. Our results apply also to all parabolic subgroups of G(n) if n is odd and to some of the parabolic subgroups of G(n) if n is even. We prove some irreducibility criteria for parabolic induction on G(n) for both even and odd n. As a corollary we show, among other results, that while for odd n, all genuine principal series representations of G(n) induced from unitary representations are irreducible, there exist reducibility points on the unitary axis if n is even. We also list all the reducible genuine principal series representations of G(2) provided that the F is not 2-adic. "
"We develop a generalization of manifold calculus in the sense of Goodwillie-Weiss where the manifold is replaced by a simplicial complex. We consider functors from the category of open subsets of a fixed simplical complex into the category of topological spaces and prove an analogue of the approximation theorem. Namely, under certain conditions such a functor can be approximated by a tower of (appropriately adapted) polynomial functors. "
"Let $\Omega$ be an open subset of $\Ri^d$ with $0\in \Omega$. Further let $H_\Omega=-\sum^d_{i,j=1}\partial_i\,c_{ij}\,\partial_j$ be a second-order partial differential operator with domain $C_c^\infty(\Omega)$ where the coefficients $c_{ij}\in W^{1,\infty}_{\rm loc}(\bar\Omega)$ are real, $c_{ij}=c_{ji}$ and the coefficient matrix $C=(c_{ij})$ satisfies bounds $0<C(x)\leq c(|x|) I$ for all $x\in \Omega$. If \[ \int^\infty_0ds\,s^{d/2}\,e^{-\lambda\,\mu(s)^2}<\infty \] for some $\lambda>0$ where $\mu(s)=\int^s_0dt\,c(t)^{-1/2}$ then we establish that $H_\Omega$ is $L_1$-unique, i.e.\ it has a unique $L_1$-extension which generates a continuous semigroup, if and only if it is Markov unique, i.e.\ it has a unique $L_2$-extension which generates a submarkovian semigroup. Moreover these uniqueness conditions are equivalent with the capacity of the boundary of $\Omega$, measured with respect to $H_\Omega$, being zero. We also demonstrate that the capacity depends on two gross features, the Hausdorff dimension of subsets $A$ of the boundary the set and the order of degeneracy of $H_\Omega$ at $A$. "
"A review of the recent refereed literature fails to confirm quantitatively that carbon dioxide (CO2) radiative forcing was the prime mover in the changes in temperature, ice-sheet volume, and related climatic variables in the glacial and interglacial periods of the past 650,000 years, even under the ""fast response"" framework where the convenient if artificial distinction between forcing and feedback is assumed. Atmospheric CO2 variations generally follow changes in temperature and other climatic variables rather than preceding them. Likewise, there is no confirmation of the often-posited significant supporting role of methane (CH4) forcing, which despite its faster atmospheric response time is simply too small, amounting to less than 0.2 W/m2 from a change of 400 ppb. We cannot quantitatively validate the numerous qualitative suggestions that the CO2 and CH4 forcings that occurred in response to the Milankovich orbital cycles accounted for more than half of the amplitude of the changes in the glacial/interglacial cycles of global temperature, sea level, and ice volume. Consequently, we infer that natural climatic variability notably the persistence of insolation forcing at key seasons and geographical locations, taken with closely-related thermal, hydrological, and cryospheric changes (such as the water vapor, cloud, and ice-albedo feedbacks) suffices in se to explain the proxy-derived, global and regional, climatic and environmental phase-transitions in the paleoclimate. If so, it may be appropriate to place anthropogenic greenhouse-gas emissions in context by separating their medium-term climatic impacts from those of a host of natural forcings and feedbacks that may, as in paleoclimatological times, prove just as significant. "
"NGC 2264-C is a high-mass protocluster where several star-formation events are known to have occurred. To investigate whether past protostellar activity has left a chemical imprint in this region, we mapped it in SiO($J = 2-1$), a shock tracer, and several other molecular lines with the Nobeyama 45 m telescope. Our observations show the presence of a complex network of protostellar outflows. The strongest SiO emission lies beyond a radius of $\sim 0.1$ pc with respect to the center of the clump, and is characterized by broad ($> 10$ km s$^{-1}$) lines and abundances of $\sim 1.4 \times 10^{-8}$ with respect to H$_2$. Interestingly, SiO appears relatively depleted ($\chi_\mathrm{SiO} \sim 4 \times 10^{-9}$) within this radius, despite it being affected by molecular outflow activity. We attribute this to fast condensation of SiO back onto dust grains and/or rapid gas-phase destruction of SiO, favored by the high density present in this area ($> 10^6$ cm$^{-3}$). Finally, we identify a peripheral, narrow-line ($\sim 2$ km s$^{-1}$) component, where SiO has an abundance of a few times 10$^{-11}$. After considering different options, we conclude that this weak emission may be tracing protostellar shocks from the star formation episode that preceded the current one, which have decelerated over time and eventually resulted in SiO being largely depleted/destroyed. Alternatively, a population of unresolved low-mass protostars may be responsible for the narrow SiO emission. High-angular resolution observations are necessary to distinguish between these two possibilities and thus understand the role of SiO as a chemical tracer of past star-formation episodes in massive protoclusters.

"We discuss the hard X-ray properties of the Seyfert galaxy Ton S 180, based upon the analysis of ASCA data. We find the X-ray flux varied by a factor ~2 on a time scale of a few thousand seconds. The source showed significantly higher amplitude of variability in the 0.5-2 keV band than in the 2-10 keV band. The continuum is adequately parameterized as a Gamma ~ 2.5 power-law across the 0.6--10 keV band . We confirm the recent discovery of an emission line of high equivalent width, due to Fe K-shell emission from highly-ionized material. These ASCA data show the Fe line profile to be broad and asymmetric and tentatively suggest it is stronger during the X-ray flares, consistent with an origin from the inner parts of an accretion disk. The X-ray spectrum is complex below 2 keV, possibly due to emission from a blend of soft X-ray lines, which would support the existence of an ionized reprocessor, most likely due to a relatively high accretion rate in this source. "
"For a fixed finite family of graphs $\mathcal{F}$, the $\mathcal{F}$-Minor-Free Deletion problem takes as input a graph $G$ and an integer $\ell$ and asks whether there exists a set $X \subseteq V(G)$ of size at most $\ell$ such that $G-X$ is $\mathcal{F}$-minor-free. For $\mathcal{F}=\{K_2\}$ and $\mathcal{F}=\{K_3\}$ this encodes Vertex Cover and Feedback Vertex Set respectively. When parameterized by the feedback vertex number of $G$ these two problems are known to admit a polynomial kernelization. Such a polynomial kernelization also exists for any $\mathcal{F}$ containing a planar graph but no forests. In this paper we show that $\mathcal{F}$-Minor-Free Deletion parameterized by the feedback vertex number is MK[2]-hard for $\mathcal{F} = \{P_3\}$. This rules out the existence of a polynomial kernel assuming $NP \subseteq coNP/poly$, and also gives evidence that the problem does not admit a polynomial Turing kernel. Our hardness result generalizes to any $\mathcal{F}$ not containing a $P_3$-subgraph-free graph, using as parameter the vertex-deletion distance to treewidth $mintw(\mathcal{F})$, where $mintw(\mathcal{F})$ denotes the minimum treewidth of the graphs in $\mathcal{F}$. For the other case, where $\mathcal{F}$ contains a $P_3$-subgraph-free graph, we present a polynomial Turing kernelization. Our results extend to $\mathcal{F}$-Subgraph-Free Deletion. "
"According to the method, suggested in our previous work (nlin/0509012) and based on the consideration of the specially coupled systems, the possibility of physical realization of the phenomena of complex analytic dynamics (such as Mandelbrot and Julia sets) is discussed. It is shown, that unlike the case of discrete maps or differential systems with periodic driving, investigated in mentioned work, there are some difficulties in attempts to obtain the Mandelbrot set for the coupled autonomous continuous systems. A system of coupled autonomous R\""{o}ssler oscillators is considered as an example. "
"In this paper, collocation methods are used for detecting blow-up solutions of nonlinear homogeneous Volterra-Hammerstein integral equations. To do this, we introduce the concept of ""blow-up collocation solution"" and analyze numerically some blow-up time estimates using collocation methods in particular examples where previous results about existence and uniqueness can be applied. Finally, we discuss the relationships between necessary conditions for blow-up of collocation solutions and exact solutions. "
"We address a long standing problem concerning the origin of bosonic excitations that strongly interact with charge carriers. We show that the time-resolved pump-probe experiments are capable to distinguish between regular bosonic degrees of freedom, e.g. phonons, and the hard-core bosons, e.g., magnons. The ability of phonon degrees of freedom to absorb essentially unlimited amount of energy renders relaxation dynamics nearly independent on the absorbed energy or the fluence. In contrast, the hard core effects pose limits on the density of energy stored in the bosonic subsystems resulting in a substantial dependence of the relaxation time on the fluence and/or excitation energy. Very similar effects can be observed also in a different setup when the system is driven by multiple pulses of equal energy. "
"We report single-dish multi-transition measurements of the 12^CO, HCN, and HCO^+ molecular line emission as well as HNC J=1-0 and HNCO in the two ultraluminous infra-red galaxies Arp220 and NGC6240. Using this new molecular line inventory, in conjunction with existing data in the literature, we compiled the most extensive molecular line data sets to date for such galaxies. The many rotational transitions, with their different excitation requirements, allow the study of the molecular gas over a wide range of different densities and temperatures with significant redundancy, and thus allow good constraints on the properties of the dense gas in these two systems. The mass (~(1-2) x 10^10 Msun) of dense gas (>10^5-6 cm^-3) found accounts for the bulk of their molecular gas mass, and is consistent with most of their IR luminosities powered by intense star bursts while self-regulated by O,B star cluster radiative pressure onto the star-forming dense molecular gas. The highly excited HCN transitions trace a gas phase ~(10-100)x denser than that of the sub-thermally excited HCO^+ lines (for both galaxies). These two phases are consistent with an underlying density-size power law found for Galactic GMCs (but with a steeper exponent), with HCN lines tracing denser and more compact regions than HCO^+. Whether this is true in IR-luminous, star forming galaxies in general remains to be seen, and underlines the need for observations of molecular transitions with high critical densities for a sample of bright (U)LIRGs in the local Universe -- a task for which the HI-FI instrument on board Herschel is ideally suited to do. "
"Understanding and using natural processes for intelligent functionalities, referred to as natural intelligence, has recently attracted interest from a variety of fields, including post-silicon computing for artificial intelligence and decision making in the behavioural sciences. In a past study, we successfully used the wave-particle duality of single photons to solve the two-armed bandit problem, which constitutes the foundation of reinforcement learning and decision making. In this study, we propose and confirm a hierarchical architecture for single-photon-based reinforcement learning and decision making that verifies the scalability of the principle. Specifically, the four-armed bandit problem is solved given zero prior knowledge in a two-layer hierarchical architecture, where polarization is autonomously adapted in order to effect adequate decision making using single-photon measurements. In the hierarchical structure, the notion of layer-dependent decisions emerges. The optimal solutions in the coarse layer and in the fine layer, however, conflict with each other in some contradictive problems. We show that while what we call a tournament strategy resolves such contradictions, the probabilistic nature of single photons allows for the direct location of the optimal solution even for contradictive problems, hence manifesting the exploration ability of single photons. This study provides insights into photon intelligence in hierarchical architectures for future artificial intelligence as well as the potential of natural processes for intelligent functionalities. "
"We consider the possibility that the inflaton is part of the dark sector and interacts with the standard model through a portal interaction with a heavy complex scalar field in equilibrium with the standard model at high energies. The inflaton and dark matter are encapsulated in a single complex field and both scalar sectors are charged under different (approximate) global U(1)'s such that the dark matter, as well as the visible pseudo-scalar are taken to be relatively light, as pseudo Nambu-Goldstone bosons of the theory. The dark matter relic density is populated by Freeze-In productions through the inflaton portal. In particular, after the reheating, production of dark matter by inflaton decay is naturally suppressed thanks to Planck stringent constraints on the dark quartic coupling, therefore preserving the non thermal scenario from any initial condition tuning. "
"This paper provides a general method for defining a generalized quantum observable (or POVM) that supplies properly normalized conditional probabilities for the time of occurrence (i.e., of detection). This method treats the time of occurrence as a probabilistic variable whose value is to be determined by experiment and predicted by the Born rule. This avoids the problematic assumption that a question about the time at which an event occurs must be answered through instantaneous measurements of a projector by an observer, common to both Rovelli (1998) and Oppenheim et al. (2000). I also address the interpretation of experiments purporting to demonstrate the quantum Zeno effect, used by Oppenheim et al. (2000) to justify an inherent uncertainty for measurements of times. "
I review the properties of pulsators located on the upper main sequence in the HR diagram and discuss asteroseismic inferences on the internal structure of stars of spectral type A and B. Special attention is given to the problem of uncertainties in stellar opacities in modelling.
Density waves of granular material (sand) flowing through a vertical pipe have been investigated. Clear density waves emerge when the cock attached to bottom end of the pipe is closed. The FFT power spectra were found to show a stable power-law form $ P(f) \sim f^{-\alpha}. $ The value of the exponent was evaluated as $\alpha \cong 4/3$. We also introduce a simple one-dimensional model which reproduces $\alpha = 4/3$ from both simulation and theoretical analysis. (to be published in Phys.Rev.Lett.)
"Speaker diarization determines who spoke and when? in an audio stream. In this study, we propose a model-based approach for robust speaker clustering using i-vectors. The ivectors extracted from different segments of same speaker are correlated. We model this correlation with a Markov Random Field (MRF) network. Leveraging the advancements in MRF modeling, we used Toeplitz Inverse Covariance (TIC) matrix to represent the MRF correlation network for each speaker. This approaches captures the sequential structure of i-vectors (or equivalent speaker turns) belonging to same speaker in an audio stream. A variant of standard Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm is adopted for deriving closed-form solution using dynamic programming (DP) and the alternating direction method of multiplier (ADMM). Our diarization system has four steps: (1) ground-truth segmentation; (2) i-vector extraction; (3) post-processing (mean subtraction, principal component analysis, and length-normalization) ; and (4) proposed speaker clustering. We employ cosine K-means and movMF speaker clustering as baseline approaches. Our evaluation data is derived from: (i) CRSS-PLTL corpus, and (ii) two meetings subset of the AMI corpus. Relative reduction in diarization error rate (DER) for CRSS-PLTL corpus is 43.22% using the proposed advancements as compared to baseline. For AMI meetings IS1000a and IS1003b, relative DER reduction is 29.37% and 9.21%, respectively. "
"A study of the possible interactions between fermions assuming only rotational invariance has revealed 15 forms for the potential involving the fermion spins. We review the experimental constraints on unobserved macroscopic, spin-dependent interactions between electrons in the range below 1 cm. An existing experiment, using 1 kHz mechanical oscillators as test masses, has been used to constrain mass-coupled forces in this range. With suitable modifications, including spin-polarized test masses, this experiment can be used to explore all 15 possible spin-dependent interactions between electrons in this range with unprecedented sensitivity. Samples of ferrimagnetic dysprosium iron garnet have been fabricated in the suitable test mass geometry and shown to have high spin density with very low intrinsic magnetism. "
"Let $K/k$ be a finite Galois extension and $\pi = \fn{Gal}(K/k)$. An algebraic torus $T$ defined over $k$ is called a $\pi$-torus if $T\times_{\fn{Spec}(k)} \fn{Spec}(K)\simeq \bm{G}_{m,K}^n$ for some integer $n$. The set of all algebraic $\pi$-tori defined over $k$ under the stably isomorphism form a semigroup, denoted by $T(\pi)$. We will give a complete proof of the following theorem due to Endo and Miyata \cite{EM5}. Theorem. Let $\pi$ be a finite group. Then $T(\pi)\simeq C(\Omega_{\bm{Z}\pi})$ where $\Omega_{\bm{Z}\pi}$ is a maximal $\bm{Z}$-order in $\bm{Q}\pi$ containing $\bm{Z}\pi$ and $C(\Omega_{\bm{Z}\pi})$ is the locally free class group of $\Omega_{\bm{Z}\pi}$, provided that $\pi$ is isomorphic to the following four types of groups : $C_n$ ($n$ is any positive integer), $D_m$ ($m$ is any odd integer $\ge 3$), $C_{q^f}\times D_m$ ($m$ is any odd integer $\ge 3$, $q$ is an odd prime number not dividing $m$, $f\ge 1$, and $(\bm{Z}/q^f\bm{Z})^{\times}=\langle \bar{p}\rangle$ for any prime divisor $p$ of $m$), $Q_{4m}$ ($m$ is any odd integer $\ge 3$, $p\equiv 3 \pmod{4}$ for any prime divisor $p$ of $m$). "
"We study a stochastic differential equation driven by a Poisson point process, which models continuous changes in a population's environment, as well as the stochastic fixation of beneficial mutations that might compensate for this change. The fixation probability of a given mutation increases as the phenotypic lag X_t between the population and the optimum grows larger, and successful mutations are assumed to fix instantaneously (leading to an adaptive jump). Our main result is that the process is transient (i.e., continued adaptation is impossible) if the rate of environmental change v exceeds a parameter m, which can be interpreted as the rate of adaptation in case every beneficial mutation gets fixed with probability 1. If v < m, the process is positive recurrent, while in the limiting case m=v, null recurrence or transience depends upon additional technical conditions. We show how our results can be extended to the case of a time varying rate of environmental change. "
Correlation functions of Landau gauge Yang-Mills theory are calculated from their equations of motion. Solutions for the three- and four-gluon vertices and the role of two-loop diagrams in the gluon propagator equation are discussed.
"One longstanding problem for the potential habitability of planets within M dwarf systems is their likelihood to be tidally locked in a synchronously rotating spin state. This problem thus far has largely been addressed only by considering two objects: the star and the planet itself. However, many systems have been found to harbor multiple planets, with some in or very near to mean-motion resonances. The presence of a planetary companion near a mean-motion resonance can induce oscillatory variations in the mean-motion of the planet, which we demonstrate can have significant effects on the spin-state of an otherwise synchronously rotating planet. In particular, we find that a planetary companion near a mean-motion resonance can excite the spin states of planets in the habitable zone of small, cool stars, pushing otherwise synchronously rotating planets into higher amplitude librations of the spin state, or even complete circulation resulting in effective stellar days with full surface coverage on the order of years or decades. This increase in illuminated area can have potentially dramatic influences on climate, and thus on habitability. We also find that the resultant spin state can be very sensitive to initial conditions due to the chaotic nature of the spin state at early times within certain regimes. We apply our model to two hypothetical planetary systems inspired by the K00255 and TRAPPIST-1 systems, which both have Earth-sized planets in mean-motion resonances orbiting cool stars. "
"It is well known that New Physics can contribute to weak decays of heavy mesons via virtual processes during its decays. The discovery of New Physics, using such decays is made difficult due to intractable strong interaction effects needed to describe it. Modes such as B -> K^* l^+ l^- offer an advantage as they provide a multitude of observables via angular analysis. We show how the multitude of ""related observables"" obtained from B -> K^* l^+ l^-, can provide many new ""clean tests"" of the Standard Model. The hallmark of these tests is that several of them are independent of the unknown universal form factors in heavy quark effective theory. We derive a relation between observables that is free of form factors and Wilson coefficients, the violation of which will be an unambiguous signal of New Physics. We also derive relations between observables and form factors that are independent of Wilson coefficients and enable verification of hadronic estimates. We show how form factor ratios can be measured directly from helicity fraction with out any assumptions what so ever. We find that the allowed parameter space for observables is very tightly constrained in Standard Model, thereby providing clean signals of New Physics. We examine both the large-recoil and low-recoil regions of the K^* meson and point out special features and derive relations between observables valid in the two limits. In the large-recoil regions several of the relations are unaffected by corrections to all orders in \alpha_s. We present yet another new relation involving only observables that would verify the validity of the relations between form-factors assumed in the low-recoil region. The several relations and constraints derived will provide unambiguous signals of New Physics if it contributes to these decays. "
"We consider a heterostructure of a metal and a barrier with onsite correlation at half filling using unrestricted Hartree Fock. We find that above a certain value of correlation strength in the barrier planes, the system is a Mott insulator, while below this value the system still behaves like a gapless insulator. The energy spectrum is found to be very novel with the presence of multiple gaps. Thus the system remains non metallic for any finite value of correlation. "
"Liquid spreading in gas-liquid concurrent trickle-bed reactors is simulated using an Eulerian twofluid CFD approach. In order to propose a model that describes exhaustively all interaction forces acting on each fluid phase with an emphasis on dispersion mechanisms, a discussion of closure laws available in the literature is proposed. Liquid dispersion is recognized to result from two main mechanisms: capillary and mechanical (Attou and Ferschneider, 2000; Lappalainen et al., 2009- The proposed model is then implemented in two trickle-bed configurations matching with two experimental set ups: In the first configuration, simulations on a 2D axisymmetric geometry are considered and the model is validated upon a new set of experimental data. Overall pressure drop and liquid distribution obtained from $\gamma$-ray tomography are provided for different geometrical and operating conditions. In the second configuration, a 3D simulation is considered and the model is compared to experimental liquid flux patterns at the bed outlet. A sensitivity analysis of liquid spreading to bed geometrical characteristics (void-fraction and particles diameter) as well as to gas and liquid flow rates is proposed. The model is shown to achieve very good agreement with experimental data and to predict, accurately, tendencies of liquid spreading for various geometrical bed characteristics and/or phases flow-rates.

"We study the use of sampling for efficiently mining the top-K frequent itemsets of cardinality at most w. To this purpose, we define an approximation to the top-K frequent itemsets to be a family of itemsets which includes (resp., excludes) all very frequent (resp., very infrequent) itemsets, together with an estimate of these itemsets' frequencies with a bounded error. Our first result is an upper bound on the sample size which guarantees that the top-K frequent itemsets mined from a random sample of that size approximate the actual top-K frequent itemsets, with probability larger than a specified value. We show that the upper bound is asymptotically tight when w is constant. Our main algorithmic contribution is a progressive sampling approach, combined with suitable stopping conditions, which on appropriate inputs is able to extract approximate top-K frequent itemsets from samples whose sizes are smaller than the general upper bound. In order to test the stopping conditions, this approach maintains the frequency of all itemsets encountered, which is practical only for small w. However, we show how this problem can be mitigated by using a variation of Bloom filters. A number of experiments conducted on both synthetic and real bench- mark datasets show that using samples substantially smaller than the original dataset (i.e., of size defined by the upper bound or reached through the progressive sampling approach) enable to approximate the actual top-K frequent itemsets with accuracy much higher than what analytically proved.

"The free-streaming length of dark matter depends on fundamental dark matter physics, and determines the abundance and central densities of dark matter halos on sub-galactic scales. Using the image positions and flux-ratios from eight quadruply-imaged quasars, we constrain the free-streaming length of dark matter, the amplitude of the subhalo mass function (SHMF), and the logarithmic slope of the SHMF. We model both main deflector subhalos and halos along the line of sight, and account for warm dark matter (WDM) free-streaming effects on both the mass function and the mass-concentration relation. By calibrating the evolution of the SHMF with host halo mass and redshift using a suite of simulated halos, we infer a global normalization for the SHMF. Our analysis accounts for finite-size background sources, and marginalizes over the mass profile of the main deflector. Parameterizing dark matter free-streaming through the half-mode mass $m_{\rm{hm}}$, we constrain dark matter warmth and the corresponding thermal relic particle mass $m_{\rm{DM}}$. At $2 \sigma$: $m_{\rm{hm}} < 10^{7.8} M_{\odot}$ ($m_{DM} > 5.2 \ \rm{keV}$). Assuming CDM, we simultaneously constrain the projected mass in substructure between $10^6 - 10^{9} M_{\odot}$ near lensed images and the logarithmic slope of the SHMF. At $2 \sigma$, we infer $0.9 - 6.9 \times 10^{7} M_{\odot} \rm{kpc^{-2}}$, corresponding to mean projected mass fractions of $\bar{f}_{\rm{sub}} = 0.034_{-0.026}^{+0.026}$, respectively. At $1 \sigma$, we constrain the logarithmic slope of the SHMF $\alpha = -1.896_{-0.026}^{+0.020}$. These results are in excellent agreement with the predictions of cold dark matter. "
"We study a minimal model of self-propelled particle in a crowded single-file environment. We extend classical models of exclusion processes (previously analyzed for diffusive and driven tracer particles) to the case where the tracer particle is a run-and-tumble particle (RTP), while all bath particles perform symmetric random walks. In the limit of high density of bath particles, we derive exact expressions for the full distribution $\mathcal{P}_n(X)$ of the RTP position $X$ and all its cumulants, valid for arbitrary values of the tumbling probability $\alpha$ and time $n$. Our results highlight striking effects of crowding on the dynamics: even cumulants of the RTP position are increasing functions of $\alpha$ at intermediate timescales, and display a subdiffusive anomalous scaling $\propto \sqrt{n}$ independent of $\alpha$ in the limit of long times $n\to \infty$. These analytical results set the ground for a quantitative analysis of experimental trajectories of real biological or artificial microswimmers in extreme confinement. "
"We study the rate of activated motion over multiple barriers, in particular the correlated double-jump of an adatom diffusing on a missing-row reconstructed Platinum (110) surface. We develop a Transition Path Theory, showing that the activation energy is given by the minimum-energy trajectory which succeeds in the double-jump. We explicitly calculate this trajectory within an effective-medium molecular dynamics simulation. A cusp in the acceptance region leads to a sqrt{T} prefactor for the activated rate of double-jumps. Theory and numerical results agree. "
I discuss the precession motion of a symmetrical top without the assumption that its precessional velocity is much smaller than its spin angular velocity. I derive the general formula for the precessional velocity in an elementary way and discuss the cases of slow and fast precessions.
"In this note we consider the $k$th level of the uniform random recursive tree after $n$ steps, and prove that the proportion of nodes with degree greater than $t\log n$ converges to $(1-t)^k$ almost surely, as $n\to\infty$, for every $t\in(0,1)$. In addition, we show that the number of degree $d$ nodes in the first level is asymptotically Poisson distributed with mean 1; moreover, they are asymptotically independent for $d=1,2,...$. "
"The subject of particle-antiparticle mixing in the neutral B meson systems is reviewed. The formalism of B0-B0bar mixing is recalled and basic Standard Model predictions are given, before experimental issues are discussed and the latest combinations of experimental results on mixing parameters are presented, including those on mixing-induced CP violation, mass differences, and decay-width differences. Finally, time-integrated mixing results are used to improve our knowledge on the fractions of the various b-hadron species produced in Z decays and at high-energy colliders. "
"We present the first ab initio calculations for $p$-shell hypernuclei including hyperon-nucleon-nucleon (YNN) contributions induced by a Similarity Renormalization Group transformation of the initial hyperon-nucleon interaction. The transformation including the YNN terms conserves the spectrum of the Hamiltonian while drastically improving model-space convergence of the Importance-Truncated No-Core Shell Model, allowing a precise extraction of binding and excitation energies. Results using a hyperon-nucleon interaction at leading order in chiral effective field theory for lower- to mid-$p$-shell hypernuclei show a good reproduction of experimental excitation energies while hyperon binding energies are typically overestimated. The induced YNN contributions are strongly repulsive and we show that they are related to a decoupling of the $\Sigma$ hyperons from the hypernuclear system, i.e., a suppression of the $\Lambda$-$\Sigma$ conversion terms in the Hamiltonian. This is linked to the so-called hyperon puzzle in neutron-star physics and provides a basic mechanism for the explanation of strong $\Lambda$NN three-baryon forces. "
"Although the Sun is our closest star by many orders of magnitude and despite having sunspot records stretching back to ancient China, our knowledge of the Sun's magnetic field is far from complete. Indeed, even now, after decades of study, the most obvious manifestations of magnetic fields in the Sun (e.g. sunspots, flares and the corona) are scarcely understood at all. These failures in spite of intense effort suggest that to improve our grasp of magnetic fields in stars and of astrophysical dynamos in general, we must broaden our base of examples beyond the Sun; we must study stars with a variety of ages, masses, rotation rates, and other properties, so we can test models against as broad a range of circumstances as possible. Over the next decade, an array of indirect techniques will be supplemented by rapidly maturing new capabilities such as gyrochronology, asteroseismology and precision photometry from space, which will transform our understanding of the temporal variability of stars and stellar systems. In this White Paper we will outline some of the key science questions in this area along with the techniques that could be used to bring new insights to these questions. "
"Let $S\subset R^n$ be a compact basic semi-algebraic set defined as the real solution set of multivariate polynomial inequalities with rational coefficients. We design an algorithm which takes as input a polynomial system defining $S$ and an integer $p\geq 0$ and returns the $n$-dimensional volume of $S$ at absolute precision $2^{-p}$.Our algorithm relies on the relationship between volumes of semi-algebraic sets and periods of rational integrals. It makes use of algorithms computing the Picard-Fuchs differential equation of appropriate periods, properties of critical points, and high-precision numerical integration of differential equations.The algorithm runs in essentially linear time with respect to~$p$. This improves upon the previous exponential bounds obtained by Monte-Carlo or moment-based methods. Assuming a conjecture of Dimca, the arithmetic cost of the algebraic subroutines for computing Picard-Fuchs equations and critical points is singly exponential in $n$ and polynomial in the maximum degree of the input. "
"The Moody-Shapere-Wilczek's adiabatic effective Hamiltonian and Lagrangian method is developed further into the matrix effective Hamiltonian (MEH) and Lagrangian (MEL) approach to a parameter-dependent quantum system. The matrix-operator approach formulated in the product integral (PI) provides not only a method to find the wave function efficiently in the MEH approach but also higher order corrections to the effective action systematically in the MEL approach, a la the Magnus expansion and the Kubo cumulant expansion. A coupled quantum system of a light particle of a harmonic oscillator is worked out, and as a by-product, a new kind of gauge potential (Berry's connection) is found even for nondegenerate cases (real eigenfunctions). Moreover, in the PI formulation the holonomy of the induced gauge potential is related to Schlesinger's exact formula for the gauge field tensor. A superadiabatic expansion is also constructed, and a generalized Dykhne formula, depending on the contour integrals of the homotopy class of complex degenerate points, is rephrased in the PI formulation. "
"We discuss recent progress in the understanding of the vacuum structure (effective superpotentials) of confining gauge theories with N=1 supersymmetry. Even for non-supersymmetric theories, appropriate perturbative calculations (e.g. using the background field method) give non-perturbative information about the vacuum structure. However, in supersymmetric theories, these results are often exact. The gauge theory effective superpotential is encoded by a hyperelliptic curve, which emerges from the geometry of the string theory background, and may be rederived using other techniques based on zero-dimensional matrix integrals, the dynamics of integrable systems and the factorization of Seiberg-Witten curves. We describe in detail how each technique highlights complementary aspects of the gauge theory. The spectral curve requires the introduction of additional fundamental matter fields, which act as UV regulators by embedding the gauge theory in a UV-finite theory. We focus in detail on maximally-confining vacua of N=1 gauge theories with fundamental matter, and of theories with SO and Sp gauge groups. Both cases require refinements to the basic techniques used for SU gauge theory without fundamental matter. We derive explicit general formulae for the effective superpotentials of N=1 theories with fundamental matter and arbitrary tree-level superpotential, which reproduce known results in special cases. The problem of factorizing the Seiberg-Witten curve for N=2 gauge theories with fundamental matter is also solved and used to rederive the corresponding N=1 effective superpotential. "
"In this letter we investigate the deep Newtonian regime of the MOND paradigm from a purely phenomenological point of view by exploiting the least-square estimated corrections to the secular rates of the perihelia of the inner and of some of the outer planets of the Solar System by E.V. Pitjeva with the EPM2004 ephemerides. By using $\mu(x)\approx 1-k_0(1/x)^n$ for the interpolating MONDian function, and by assuming that $k_0$, considered body-independent so to avoid violations of the equivalence principle, experiences no spatial variations throughout the Solar System we tightly constrain $n$ with the ratios of the perihelion precessions for different pairs of planets. We find that the range $1\leq n\leq 2$ is neatly excluded at much more than $3-\sigma$ level. Such a test would greatly benefit from the use of extra-precessions of perihelia independently estimated by other groups as well. "
"If the 750 GeV diphoton excess is identified with the color-singlet isosinglet-technipion, $P^0$ (750), in the one-family walking technicolor, as in our previous paper, then there should exist another color-singlet technipion, isotriplet one, $P^{\pm,3}$, definitely predicted at around 950 GeV independently of the dynamical details. The $P^{\pm,3}(950)$ are produced at the LHC via vector boson and photon fusion processes, predominantly decaying to $W \gamma$, and $\gamma\gamma$, respectively. Those walking technicolor signals can be explored at the Run 2, or 3, which would further open a way to a plethora of yet other (colored) technipions. "
The complex structure of the Salvinia molesta is investigated via rare event molecular dynamics simulations. Results show that a hydrophilic/hydrophobic patterning together with a re-entrant geometry control the free energy barriers for bubble nucleation and for the Cassie-Wenzel transition. This natural paradigm is translated into simple macroscopic design criteria for engineering robust superhydrophobicity in submerged applications.
"There is an extremely simple relationship between the spectrum of the gravitational wave background produced by a cosmological distribution of discrete gravitational wave sources, the total time-integrated energy spectrum of an individual source, and the present-day comoving number density of remnants. Stated in this way, the background is entirely independent of the cosmology, and only weakly dependent on the evolutionary history of the sources. This relationship allows one easily to compute the amplitude and spectrum of cosmic gravitational wave backgrounds from a broad range of astrophysical sources, and to evaluate the uncertainties therein. "
"Using mirror symmetry in Calabi-Yau manifolds M, three point functions of A(M)-model operators on the genus $0$ Riemann surface in cases of one-parameter families of $d$-folds realized as Fermat type hypersurfaces embedded in weighted projective spaces and a two-parameter family of $d$-fold embedded in a weighted projective space ${\amb}$ are studied. These three point functions ${\corr{\,{{\cal O}^{(1)}_{a}}\, {{\cal O}^{(l-1)}_{b}}\, {{\cal O}^{(d-l)}_{c}}\, }}$ are expanded by indeterminates ${q_l}$=${e^{2\pi i {t_l}}}$ associated with a set of {\kae} coordinates $\{{t_l}\}$ and their expansion coefficients count the number of maps. From these analyses, we can read fusion structure of Calabi-Yau A(M)-model operators. In our cases they constitute a subring of a total quantum cohomology ring of the A(M)-model operators. In fact we switch off all perturbation operators on the topological theories except for marginal ones associated with {\kae} forms of M. For that reason, the charge conservation of operators turns out to be a classical one. "
"It is a hard and important problem to find the criterion of the set of positive-definite matrixes which can be written as reduced density operators of a multi-partite quantum state. This problem is closely related to the study of many-body quantum entanglement which is one of the focuses of current quantum information theory. We give several results on the necessary compatibility relations between a set of reduced density matrixes, including: (i) compatibility conditions for the one-party reduced density matrixes of any $N_A\times N_B$ dimensional bi-partite mixed quantum state, (ii) compatibility conditions for the one-party and two-party reduced density matrixes of any $N_A\times N_B\times N_C$ dimensional tri-partite mixed quantum state, and (iii) compatibility conditions for the one-party reduced matrixes of any $M$-partite pure quantum state with the dimension $N^{\otimes M}$.

"This paper employs a Skellam process to represent real-time betting odds for English Premier League (EPL) soccer games. Given a matrix of market odds on all possible score outcomes, we estimate the expected scoring rates for each team. The expected scoring rates then define the implied volatility of an EPL game. As events in the game evolve, we re-estimate the expected scoring rates and our implied volatility measure to provide a dynamic representation of the market's expectation of the game outcome. Using a dataset of 1520 EPL games from 2012-2016, we show how our model calibrates well to the game outcome. We illustrate our methodology on real-time market odds data for a game between Everton and West Ham in the 2015-2016 season. We show how the implied volatility for the outcome evolves as goals, red cards, and corner kicks occur. Finally, we conclude with directions for future research. "
"A Green's function based solver for the modified Bessel equation has been developed with the primary motivation of solving the Poisson equation in cylindrical geometries. The method is implemented using a Discrete Hankel Transform and a Green's function based on the modified Bessel functions of the first and second kind. The computation of these Bessel functions has been implemented to avoid scaling problems due to their exponential and singular behavior, allowing the method to be used for large order problems, as would arise in solving the Poisson equation with a dense azimuthal grid. The method has been tested on monotonically decaying and oscillatory inputs, checking for errors due to interpolation and/or aliasing. The error has been found to reach machine precision and to have computational time linearly proportional to the number of nodes. "
"The goal of this paper is to define fermionic fields on causal set. This is done by the use of holonomies to define vierbines, and then defining spinor fields by taking advantage of the leftover degrees of freedom of holonomies plus additional scalar fields. Grassmann nature is being enforced by allowing measure to take both positive and negative values, and also by introducing a vector space to have both commutting dot product and anticommutting wedge product. "
GTPase molecules are important regulators in cells that continuously run through an activation/deactivation and membrane-attachment/membrane-detachment cycle. Activated GTPase is able to localize in parts of the membranes and to induce cell polarity. As feedback loops contribute to the GTPase cycle and as the coupling between membrane-bound and cytoplasmic processes introduces different diffusion coefficients a Turing mechanism is a natural candidate for this symmetry breaking. We formulate a mathematical model that couples a reaction-diffusion system in the inner volume to a reaction-diffusion system on the membrane via a flux condition and an attachment/detachment law at the membrane. We present a reduction to a simpler non-local reaction-diffusion model and perform a stability analysis and numerical simulations for this reduction. Our model in principle does support Turing instabilities but only if the lateral diffusion of inactivated GTPase is much faster than the diffusion of activated GTPase.
"We prove that if a tree $T$ has $n$ vertices and maximum degree at most $\Delta$, then a copy of $T$ can almost surely be found in the random graph $\mathcal{G}(n,\Delta\log^5 n/n)$. "
"Many currently deployed Reinforcement Learning agents work in an environment shared with humans, be them co-workers, users or clients. It is desirable that these agents adjust to people's preferences, learn faster thanks to their help, and act safely around them. We argue that most current approaches that learn from human feedback are unsafe: rewarding or punishing the agent a-posteriori cannot immediately prevent it from wrong-doing. In this paper, we extend Policy Gradient to make it robust to external directives, that would otherwise break the fundamentally on-policy nature of Policy Gradient. Our technique, Directed Policy Gradient (DPG), allows a teacher or backup policy to override the agent before it acts undesirably, while allowing the agent to leverage human advice or directives to learn faster. Our experiments demonstrate that DPG makes the agent learn much faster than reward-based approaches, while requiring an order of magnitude less advice. "
"We study the combinatorics of crystal graphs given by highest weight representations of types $A_{n}, B_{n}, C_{n}$, and $D_{n}$, uncovering new relations that exist among crystal operators. Much structure in these graphs has been revealed by local relations given by Stembridge and Sternberg. However, there exist relations among crystal operators that are not implied by Stembridge or Sternberg relations. Viewing crystal graphs as edge colored posets, we use poset topology to study them. Using the lexicographic discrete Morse functions of Babson and Hersh, we relate the M\""obius function of a given interval in a crystal poset of simply laced or doubly laced type to the types of relations that can occur among crystal operators within this interval. For a crystal of a highest weight representation of finite classical Cartan type, we show that whenever there exists an interval whose M\""obius function is not equal to -1, 0, or 1, there must be a relation among crystal operators within this interval not implied by Stembridge or Sternberg relations. As an example of an application, this yields relations among crystal operators in type $C_{n}$ that were not previously known. Additionally, by studying the structure of Sternberg relations in the doubly laced case, we prove that crystals of highest weight representations of types $B_{2}$ and $C_{2}$ are not lattices. "
"We discuss the localized tachyon condensation in the non-supersymmetric orbifold theories by taking the cosmological constant as the measure of degrees of freedom (d.o.f). We first show asymptotic density of state is not a proper quantity to count the 'localized' d.o.f. We then show that localized d.o.f lead us a c-function given by the lightest tachyon mass, which turns out to be the same as the tachyon potential recently suggested by Dabholkar and Vafa. We also argue that delocalized d.o.f also encode information on the process of localized tachyon condensation in the g-function, based on the fact that the global geometry of the orbifolds is completely determined by the local geometry around the fixed points. For type II, both c- and g-function respect the stability of the supersymmetric models and both allow all the process suggested by Adams, Polchinski and Silverstein. "
"Recent auto-correlation and fluctuation analysis of time series data in the brightness curves and micro-lensing size scales seen in Q0957+561 A,B has produced important information about the existence and characteristic physical dimensions of a new non-standard internal structure contained within this quasar. We find that the new internal quasar structure, which we shall call the Schild-Vakulik Structure, can be consistently explained in terms of a new class of gravitationally collapsing solutions to the Einstein field equations which describe highly redshifted, Eddington limited, Magnetospheric Eternally Collapsing Objects (MECO) that contain intrinsic magnetic moments. Since observation of the Schild-Vakulik structure within Q0957+561 implies that this quasar contains an observable intrinsic magnetic moment, this represents strong evidence that this quasar does not have an event horizon "
"The discovery of the first interstellar asteroid, 1I/2017 U1 (`Oumuamua), has opened a new era for research on interstellar objects. In this paper, we study the rotational dynamics of interstellar asteroids (ISAs) of irregular shapes moving through the interstellar gas. We find that regular mechanical torques resulting from the bombardment of gas flow on the irregular body could be important for the dynamics and destruction of ISAs. Mechanical torques can spin up the ISA, resulting in the breakup of the original ISA into small binary asteroids when the rotation rate exceeds the critical frequency. We find that the breakup timescale is short for ISAs of highly irregular shapes and low tensile strength. We apply our results to the first observed ISA, `Oumuamua, and suggest that its extreme elongated shape may originate from a reassembly of the binary fragments due to gravity along its journey in the interstellar medium. The tumbling of `Oumuamua could have been induced by rotational disruption due to mechanical torques. Finally, we discuss the survival possibility of high-velocity asteroids presumably formed by tidal disruption of planetary systems by the black hole at the Galactic center. "
"We present recent results for the prediction of the Bs lifetime difference from lattice Heavy Quark Effective Theory simulations. In order to get a next-to-leading order result we have calculated the matching between QCD and HQET and the two-loop anomalous dimensions in the HQET for all the \Delta B=2 operators, in particular for the operators which enter the width difference. We present results from quenched and, for the first time, from unquenched simulations. We obtain for the Bs lifetime difference, (\Delta\Gamma_Bs/\Gamma_Bs)^{(que.)}=(5.1+/- 1.9+/- 1.7)10^(-2) and (\Delta\Gamma_Bs/\Gamma_Bs)^{(unq.)}=(4.3+/- 2.0+/- 1.9)10^(-2) from the quenched and unquenched simulations respectively "
"We investigate the non-gaussian properties of cosmic-string-seeded linear density perturbations with cold and hot dark matter backgrounds, using high-resolution numerical simulations. We compute the one-point probability density function of the resulting density field, its skewness, kurtosis, and genus curves for different smoothing scales. A semi-analytic model is then invoked to provide a physical interpretation of our results. We conclude that on scales smaller than $1.5{(\Omega h^2)}^{-1}$Mpc, perturbations seeded by cosmic strings are very non-gaussian. These scales may still be in a linear or mildly non-linear regime in an open or $\Lambda$-universe with $\Gamma=\Omega h \lsim 0.2$. "
"We discuss recent developments for exact reformulations of lattice field theories in terms of worldlines and worldsheets. In particular we focus on a strategy which is applicable also to non-abelian theories: traces and matrix/vector products are written as explicit sums over color indices and a dual variable is introduced for each individual term. These dual variables correspond to fluxes in both, space-time and color for matter fields (Abelian color fluxes), or to fluxes in color space around space-time plaquettes for gauge fields (Abelian color cycles). Subsequently all original degrees of freedom, i.e., matter fields and gauge links, can be integrated out. Integrating over complex phases of matter fields gives rise to constraints that enforce conservation of matter flux on all sites. Integrating out phases of gauge fields enforces vanishing combined flux of matter- and gauge degrees of freedom. The constraints give rise to a system of worldlines and worldsheets. Integrating over the factors that are not phases (e.g., radial degrees of freedom or contributions from the Haar measure) generates additional weight factors that together with the constraints implement the full symmetry of the conventional formulation, now in the language of worldlines and worldsheets. We discuss the Abelian color flux and Abelian color cycle strategies for three examples: the SU(2) principal chiral model with chemical potential coupled to two of the Noether charges, SU(2) lattice gauge theory coupled to staggered fermions, as well as full lattice QCD with staggered fermions. For the principal chiral model we present some simulation results that illustrate properties of the worldline dynamics at finite chemical potentials. "
"We demonstrate that it is possible to prepare a lattice gas of ultracold atoms with a desired non-classical spin-correlation function using atom-light interaction of the kind routinely employed in quantum spin polarization spectroscopy. Our method is based on quantum non-demolition (QND) measurement and feedback, and allows in particular to create on demand exponentially or algebraically decaying correlations, as well as a certain degree of multi-partite entanglement.

"Optical absorption spectra of Cr$^{3+}$-Cr$^{2+}$ pair center in KZnF$_{3}$:Cr$^{3+}$,Cr$^{2+}$ crystal were investigated in wide temperature range. Broad band at 30800 cm$^{-1}$ is attributed to cation-cation (e_g)-electron transfer transition. Narrow lines with maxima at 16720 cm$^{-1}$ and 19880 cm$^{-1}$ have been assigned to purely electronic exchange-induced electric-dipole transitions from the ground (Cr$^{3+}$,(^4A_{2g});Cr$^{2+}$,(^5E_g)) state to excited (Cr$^{3+}$,(^4A_{2g});Cr$^{2+}$,(^3E_g^a)) and (Cr$^{3+}$,(^4A_{2g});Cr$^{2+}$,(^3E_g^b)) states, respectively. It's vibronic satellites corresponding to (a_{1g}) local mode of Cr$^{3+}$ fluorine octahedron of the pair are also observed. Energy of the local mode for the ground and mentioned excited states are 580, 540 and 530 cm$^{-1}$. Instead of expected double exchange for mixed valence pair ferromagnetic superexchange for Cr$^{3+}$-Cr$^{2+}$ pair in KZnF$_{3}$ crystal is realized. Exchange integral (J=-14.9\pm0.4) cm$^{-1}$ and Jahn-Teller splitting (\Delta_{JT}=340\pm40) cm$^{-1}$ for the ground state of the pair were obtained by analysis of the temperature dependence of absorption lines. Important features of the crossover double exchange - ferromagnetic superexchange are discussed. "
"We present a kinematical and photometrical study of a member, NGC4778, of the nearest (z=0.0137) compact group: Hickson 62. Our analysis reveals that Hickson 62a, also known as NGC4778, is an S0 galaxy with kinematical and morphological peculiarities, both in its central regions (r < 5'') and in the outer halo. In the central regions, the rotation curve shows the existence of a kinematically decoupled stellar component, offset with respect to the photometric center. In the outer halo we find an asymmetric rotation curve and a velocity dispersion profile showing a rise on the SW side, in direction of the galaxy NGC4776. "
Log Enriques surfaces with delta=1 are classified.
"We provide a simple criterion for an element of the mapping class group of a closed surface to have normal closure equal to the whole mapping class group. We apply this to show that every nontrivial periodic mapping class that is not a hyperelliptic involution is a normal generator for the mapping class group when the genus is at least 3. We also give many examples of pseudo-Anosov normal generators, answering a question of D. D. Long. In fact we show that every pseudo-Anosov mapping class with stretch factor less than $\sqrt{2}$ is a normal generator. Even more, we give pseudo-Anosov normal generators with arbitrarily large stretch factors and arbitrarily large translation lengths on the curve graph, disproving a conjecture of Ivanov. "
"The large Reynolds number asymptotic approximation of the neutral curve of Taylor-Couette flow subject to axial uniform magnetic field is analysed. The flow has been extensively studied since early 90's as the magneto-rotational instability (MRI) occurring in the flow could possibly explain the origin of the instability observed in certain astrophysical objects. Elsewhere the ideal approximation has been used to study high-speed flows, whilst it sometimes produces paradoxical results. For example, ideal flows must be completely stabilised for strong enough applied magnetic field, but on the other hand the vanishing magnetic Prandtl number limit of the stability should be purely hydrodynamic so instability must occur when Rayleigh's stability condition is violated. The first our discovery is that this apparent contradiction can be resolved by showing the abrupt appearance of the hydrodynamic instability at certain critical value of magnetic Prandtl number, which can be found by asymptotically large Reynolds number limit but with long enough wavelength to retain some diffusive effects. The second our finding concerns so-called Velikhov-Chandrasekhar paradox, namely the mismatch of the zero external magnetic field limit of the Velikhov-Chandrasekhar stability criterion and Rayleigh's stability criterion. We show for fully wide gap cases that the high Reynolds number asymptotic analysis of the MRI naturally yields the simple stability condition that describes smooth transition from Rayleigh to Velikhov-Chandrasekhar stability criteria with increasing Lundquist number. "
"We present an approach to type theory in which the typing judgments do not have explicit contexts. Instead of judgments of shape ""Gamma |- A : B"", our systems just have judgments of shape ""A : B"". A key feature is that we distinguish free and bound variables even in pseudo-terms. Specifically we give the rules of the ""Pure Type System"" class of type theories in this style. We prove that the typing judgments of these systems correspond in a natural way with those of Pure Type Systems as traditionally formulated. I.e., our systems have exactly the same well-typed terms as traditional presentations of type theory. Our system can be seen as a type theory in which all type judgments share an identical, infinite, typing context that has infinitely many variables for each possible type. For this reason we call our system ""Gamma_infinity"". This name means to suggest that our type judgment ""A : B"" should be read as ""Gamma_infinity |- A : B"", with a fixed infinite type context called ""Gamma_infinity"". "
"We investigate that temperature can be measured by a modified Michelson interferometer, where at least one reflected mirror is replaced by a thermalized sample. Both of two mirrors replaced by the corresponding two thermalized samples can help to approximatively improve the resolution of temperature up to twice than only one mirror replaced by a thermalized sample. For further improving the precision, a nonlinear medium can be employed. The Michelson interferometer is embedded in a gas displaying Kerr nonlinearity. We obtain the analytical equations and numerically calculate the precision with parameters within the reach of current technology, proving that the precision of temperature can be greatly enhanced by using a nonlinear medium. Our results show that one can create an accurate thermometer by measuring the photons in the Michelson interferometer, with no need for directly measuring the population of thermalized sample. "
"We investigate the local geometry of a class of K\""ahler submanifolds $M \subset \R^n$ which generalize surfaces of constant mean curvature. The role of the mean curvature vector is played by the $(1,1)$-part (i.e. the $dz_id\bar z_j$-components) of the second fundamental form $\alpha$, which we call the pluri-mean curvature. We show that these K\""ahler submanifolds are characterized by the existence of an associated family of isometric submanifolds with rotated second fundamental form. Of particular interest is the isotropic case where this associated family is trivial. We also investigate the properties of the corresponding Gauss map which is pluriharmonic. "
We prove that the integrality gap of the Goemans--Linial semidefinite programming relaxation for the Sparsest Cut Problem is $\Omega(\sqrt{\log n})$ on inputs with $n$ vertices.
"The phase diagram of the multichannel Kondo Hamiltonian with an XXZ spin-exchange anisotropy is revisited, revealing a far richer fixed-point structure than previously appreciated. For a spin-1/2 impurity and k > 2 conduction-electron channels, a second ferromagnetic-like domain is found deep in the antiferromagnetic regime. The new domain extends above a (typically large) critical longitudinal coupling J_z^{\ast} > 0, and is separated from the antiferromagnetic domain by a second Kosterliz-Thouless line. A similar line of stable ferromagnetic-like fixed points with a residual isospin-1/2 local moment is shown to exist for large J_z >> |J_{\perp}| > 0 and arbitrary k and s obeying |k - 2s| > 1. Here J_z is the longitudinal spin-exchange coupling, J_{\perp} is the transverse coupling, and s is the impurity spin. Near the free-impurity fixed-point, spin-exchange anisotropy is a relevant perturbation for s > 1/2 and arbitrary k. Depending on the sign of J_z^2 - J_{\perp}^2 and the parity of 2s, the system flows either to a conventional Fermi liquid with no residual degeneracy, or to a k-channel, spin-1/2 Kondo effect, or to a line of ferromagnetic-like fixed points with a residual isospin-1/2 local moment. These results are obtained through a combination of perturbative renormalization-group techniques, Abelian bosonization, a strong-coupling expansion in 1/J_z, and explicit numerical renormalization-group calculations.

"We present the discovery of KELT-21b, a hot Jupiter transiting the $V=10.5$ A8V star HD 332124. The planet has an orbital period of $P=3.6127647\pm0.0000033$ days and a radius of $1.586_{-0.040}^{+0.039}$ $R_J$. We set an upper limit on the planetary mass of $M_P<3.91$ $M_J$ at $3\sigma$ confidence. We confirmed the planetary nature of the transiting companion using this mass limit and Doppler tomographic observations to verify that the companion transits HD 332124. These data also demonstrate that the planetary orbit is well-aligned with the stellar spin, with a sky-projected spin-orbit misalignment of $\lambda=-5.6_{-1.9}^{+1.7 \circ}$. The star has $T_{\mathrm{eff}}=7598_{-84}^{+81}$ K, $M_*=1.458_{-0.028}^{+0.029}$ $M_{\odot}$, $R_*=1.638\pm0.034$ $R_{\odot}$, and $v\sin I_*=146$ km s$^{-1}$, the highest projected rotation velocity of any star known to host a transiting hot Jupiter. The star also appears to be somewhat metal-poor and $\alpha$-enhanced, with [Fe/H]$=-0.405_{-0.033}^{+0.032}$ and [$\alpha$/Fe]$=0.145 \pm 0.053$; these abundances are unusual, but not extraordinary, for a young star with thin-disk kinematics like KELT-21. High-resolution imaging observations revealed the presence of a pair of stellar companions to KELT-21, located at a separation of 1.2"" and with a combined contrast of $\Delta K_S=6.39 \pm 0.06$ with respect to the primary. Although these companions are most likely physically associated with KELT-21, we cannot confirm this with our current data. If associated, the candidate companions KELT-21 B and C would each have masses of $\sim0.12$ $M_{\odot}$, a projected mutual separation of $\sim20$ AU, and a projected separation of $\sim500$ AU from KELT-21. KELT-21b may be one of only a handful of known transiting planets in hierarchical triple stellar systems. "
"In this paper we offer a definition of monogenicity for functions defined on $\rr^{n+1}$ with values in the Clifford algebra $\rr_n$ following an idea inspired by the recent papers \cite{gs}, \cite{advances}. This new class of monogenic functions contains the polynomials (and, more in general, power series) with coefficients in the Clifford algebra $\rr_n$. We will prove a Cauchy integral formula as well as some of its consequences. Finally, we deal with the zeroes of some polynomials and power series. "
"We present a fairly new and comprehensive approach to the study of stationary flows of the Korteweg-de Vries hierarchy. They are obtained by means of a double restriction process from a dynamical system in an infinite number of variables. This process naturally provides us with a Lax representation of the flows, which is used to find their bi-Hamiltonian formulation. Then we prove the separability of these flows making use of their bi-Hamiltonian structure, and we show that the variables of separation are supplied by the Poisson pair. "
"We propose a new write channel model for bit-patterned media recording that reflects the data dependence of write synchronization errors. It is shown that this model accommodates both substitution-like errors and insertion-deletion errors whose statistics are determined by an underlying channel state process. We study information theoretic properties of the write channel model, including the capacity, symmetric information rate, Markov-1 rate and the zero-error capacity. "
"In this paper, solutions to the Ernst equation are investigated that depend on two real analytic functions defined on the interval [0,1]. These solutions are introduced by a suitable limiting process of Backlund transformations applied to seed solutions of the Weyl class. It turns out that this class of solutions contains the general relativistic gravitational field of an arbitrary differentially rotating disk of dust, for which a continuous transition to some Newtonian disk exists. It will be shown how for given boundary conditions (i. e. proper surface mass density or angular velocity of the disk) the gravitational field can be approximated in terms of the above solutions. Furthermore, particular examples will be discussed, including disks with a realistic profile for the angular velocity and more exotic disks possessing two spatially separated ergoregions. "
"Impact dynamics during collisions of spheres with granular media reveal a pronounced and non-trivial dependence on volume fraction \phi. Post impact crater morphology identifies the critical packing state \phi_{cps}, where sheared grains neither dilate nor consolidate, and indicates an associated change in spatial response. Current phenomenological models fail to capture the observed impact force for most \phi; only near \phi_{cps} is force separable into additive terms linear in depth and quadratic in velocity. At fixed depth the quadratic drag coefficient decreases (increases) with depth for \phi < \phi_{cps} (\phi > \phi_{cps}). At fixed low velocity, depth dependence of force shows a Janssen-type exponential response with a length scale that decreases with increasing \phi; and is nearly constant for \phi > \phi_{cps}. "
"Early warning signals have been proposed to forecast the possibility of a critical transition, such as the eutrophication of a lake, the collapse of a coral reef, or the end of a glacial period. Because such transitions often unfold on temporal and spatial scales that can be difficult to approach by experimental manipulation, research has often relied on historical observations as a source of natural experiments. Here we examine a critical difference between selecting systems for study based on the fact that we have observed a critical transition and those systems for which we wish to forecast the approach of a transition. This difference arises by conditionally selecting systems known to experience a transition of some sort and failing to account for the bias this introduces -- a statistical error often known as the Prosecutor's Fallacy. By analysing simulated systems that have experienced transitions purely by chance, we reveal an elevated rate of false positives in common warning signal statistics. We further demonstrate a model-based approach that is less subject to this bias than these more commonly used summary statistics. We note that experimental studies with replicates avoid this pitfall entirely. "
"We present UBVRI photometry of the supernova 2017eaw in NGC 6946, obtained in the period from May 14 until December 7, 2017. We derive dates and magnitudes of maximum light in the UBVRI bands and the parameters of the light curves. We discuss colour evolution, extinction and maximum luminosity of SN 2017eaw. Preliminary modeling is carried out, and the results are in satisfactory agreement with the light curves in the UBVRI bands. "
"An algorithm is developed to compute the complete CS decomposition (CSD) of a partitioned unitary matrix. Although the existence of the CSD has been recognized since 1977, prior algorithms compute only a reduced version (the 2-by-1 CSD) that is equivalent to two simultaneous singular value decompositions. The algorithm presented here computes the complete 2-by-2 CSD, which requires the simultaneous diagonalization of all four blocks of a unitary matrix partitioned into a 2-by-2 block structure. The algorithm appears to be the only fully specified algorithm available. The computation occurs in two phases. In the first phase, the unitary matrix is reduced to bidiagonal block form, as described by Sutton and Edelman. In the second phase, the blocks are simultaneously diagonalized using techniques from bidiagonal SVD algorithms of Golub, Kahan, and Demmel. The algorithm has a number of desirable numerical features. "
"A new method for the construction of conformally invariant equations in an arbitrary four dimensional (pseudo-) Riemannian space is presented. This method uses the Weyl geometry as a tool and exploits the natural conformal invariance we can build in the framework of this geometry. Indeed, working in a Weyl space, using the Weyl covariant derivative and the intrinsic Weylian geometrical tensors, all conformally homogeneous operators will be conformally invariant, as will the equations they determine. A Weyl space is defined by two independent objects: the metric tensor $g_{\mu\nu}$ and the Weyl vector $W_{\mu}$. A simple procedure allows us to go from a Weyl space into a Riemann space by imposing the Weyl vector to be a gradient. Under some conditions, the Weylian conformally invariant equations reduce to Riemannian conformally invariant equations. This method is applied to construct some conformally invariant scalar field equations, check the conformal invariance of Maxwell equations and recover the Eastwood-Singer conformal gauge fixing condition. "
"In many two-sided markets, the parties to be matched have incomplete information about their characteristics. We consider the settings where the parties engaged are extremely patient and are interested in long-term partnerships. Hence, once the final matches are determined, they persist for a long time. Each side has an opportunity to learn (some) relevant information about the other before final matches are made. For instance, clients seeking workers to perform tasks often conduct interviews that require the workers to perform some tasks and thereby provide information to both sides. The performance of a worker in such an interview- and hence the information revealed - depends both on the inherent characteristics of the worker and the task and also on the actions taken by the worker (e.g. the effort expended), which are not observed by the client. Thus there is moral hazard. Our goal is to derive a dynamic matching mechanism that facilitates learning on both sides before final matches are achieved and ensures that the worker side does not have incentive to obscure learning of their characteristics through their actions. We derive such a mechanism that leads to final matching that achieve optimal performance (revenue) in equilibrium. We show that the equilibrium strategy is long-run coalitionally stable, which means there is no subset of workers and clients that can gain by deviating from the equilibrium strategy. We derive all the results under the modeling assumption that the utilities of the agents are defined as limit of means of the utility obtained in each interaction. "
"In the present paper we consider the extended scalar-tensor-Gauss-Bonnet gravity with a massive scalar field. We prove numerically the existence of Gauss-Bonnet black holes for three different forms of the coupling function including the case of spontaneous scalarization. We have performed a systematic study of the black hole characteristics such as the area of the horizon, the entropy and the temperature for these coupling functions and compared them to the Schwarzschild solutions. The introduction of scalar field mass leads to a suppression of the scalar field and the increase of this mass brings the black holes closer to the Schwarzschild case. For linear and exponential coupling, a nonzero scalar field mass expands the domain of existence of black holes solutions. Larger deviations from the GR case are observed only for small masses and these differences decrease with the increase of the scalar field mass. In the case of a coupling function which leads to scalarization the scalar field mass has a significant influence on the bifurcation points where the scalarized black holes branch out of the Schwarzschild solution. The largest deviation from the case with a massless scalar field are observed for black hole masses close to the bifurcation point. "
"We present a new family of maximum rank distance (MRD) codes. The new class contains codes that are neither equivalent to a generalised Gabidulin nor to a twisted Gabidulin code, the only two known general constructions of linear MRD codes. "
"We investigate deformations of Gauss-Bonnet-Lifshitz holography in $(n+1)$ dimensional spacetime. Marginally relevant operators are dynamically generated by a momentum scale $\Lambda \sim 0$ and correspond to slightly deformed Gauss-Bonnet-Lifshitz spacetimes via a holographic picture. To admit (non-trivial) sub-leading orders of the asymptotic solution for the marginal mode, we find that the value of the dynamical critical exponent $z$ is restricted by $z= n-1-2(n-2) \tilde{\alpha}$, where $\tilde{\alpha}$ is the (rescaled) Gauss-Bonnet coupling constant. The generic black hole solution, which is characterized by the horizon flux of the vector field and $\tilde{\alpha}$, is obtained in the bulk, and we explore its thermodynamic properties for various values of $n$ and $\tilde{\alpha}$. "
"We classify all quadratic imaginary number fields that have a Euclidean ideal class. There are seven of them, they are of class number at most two, and in each case the unique class that generates the class-group is moreover norm-Euclidean. "
"Network data has rapidly emerged as an important and active area of statistical methodology. In this paper we consider the problem of anomaly detection in networks. Given a large background network, we seek to detect whether there is a small anomalous subgraph present in the network, and if such a subgraph is present, which nodes constitute the subgraph. We propose an inferential tool based on egonets to answer this question. The proposed method is computationally efficient and naturally amenable to parallel computing, and easily extends to a wide variety of network models. We demonstrate through simulation studies that the egonet method works well under a wide variety of network models. We obtain some fascinating empirical results by applying the egonet method on several well-studied benchmark datasets. "
"Stochastic approximation algorithm is a useful technique which has been exploited successfully in probability theory and statistics for a long time. The step sizes used in stochastic approximation are generally taken to be deterministic and same is true for the drift. However, the specific application of urn models with random replacement matrices motivates us to consider stochastic approximation in a setup where both the step sizes and the drift are random, but the sequence is uniformly bounded. The problem becomes interesting when the negligibility conditions on the errors hold only in probability. We first prove a result on stochastic approximation in this setup, which is new in the literature. Then, as an application, we study urn models with random replacement matrices. In the urn model, the replacement matrices need neither be independent, nor identically distributed. We assume that the replacement matrices are only independent of the color drawn in the same round conditioned on the entire past. We relax the usual second moment assumption on the replacement matrices in the literature and require only first moment to be finite. We require the conditional expectation of the replacement matrix given the past to be close to an irreducible matrix, in an appropriate sense. We do not require any of the matrices to be balanced or nonrandom. We prove convergence of the proportion vector, the composition vector and the count vector in $L^1$, and hence in probability. It is to be noted that the related differential equation is of Lotka-Volterra type and can be analyzed directly. "
"The role of the meson-exchange current correction to the nuclear charge operator is studied in electron scattering processes involving the excitation of medium and heavy nuclei to energies up to the quasi-elastic peak. The effect of these contributions in the quasi-free electron scattering process is a reduction of at most a 3% in the longitudinal response at the energy of the peak, a value which is below the experimental error and must not be taken into account in calculations in this energy region. On the other hand, the excitation of low-lying nuclear levels of neutronic character shows, with respect to the protonic ones, a considerable effect due to the inclusion of the two-body term in the charge operator. More realistic calculations, such as those performed in the random-phase approximation framework, give rise to a mixing of one particle-one hole configurations of both kinds which reduce these effects. However, it has been found that the excitation of some of these levels is sizeably affected by the meson-exchange contribution. More precise experimental data concerning some of these states, such as e.g. the high-spin states in 208Pb, could throw some light in the problem of a more feasible determination of these effects and, as a consequence, could provide an alternative procedure to obtain the charge neutron form factor. "
"A long genomic segment inherited by a pair of individuals from a single, recent common ancestor is said to be identical-by-descent (IBD). Shared IBD segments have numerous applications in genetics, from demographic inference to phasing, imputation, pedigree reconstruction, and disease mapping. Here, we provide a theoretical analysis of IBD sharing under Markovian approximations of the coalescent with recombination. We describe a general framework for the IBD process along the chromosome under the Markovian models (SMC/SMC'), as well as introduce and justify a new model, which we term the renewal approximation, under which lengths of successive segments are independent. Then, considering the infinite-chromosome limit of the IBD process, we recover previous results (for SMC) and derive new results (for SMC') for the mean number of shared segments longer than a cutoff and the fraction of the chromosome found in such segments. We then use renewal theory to derive an expression (in Laplace space) for the distribution of the number of shared segments and demonstrate implications for demographic inference. We also compute (again, in Laplace space) the distribution of the fraction of the chromosome in shared segments, from which we obtain explicit expressions for the first two moments. Finally, we generalize all results to populations with a variable effective size. "
"The quasi-SU(3) symmetry, as found in shell model calculations, refers to the dominance of the single particle plus quadrupole-quadrupole terms in the Hamiltonian used to describe well deformed nuclei, and to the subspace relevant in its diagonalization. It provides a very efficient basis truncation scheme. It is shown that a small number of SU(3) coupled irreps, those with the largest C_2 values within the direct product of the proton and neutron SU(3) irreps with spin 0 and 1 (for even number of particles), and spin 1/2 and 3/2 for (for odd number of nucleons), are enough to describe the low energy spectra and B(E2) transition strengths of 21Ne, 23Na and 25Mg. A simple but realistic Hamiltonian is employed. Results compare favorably both with experimental data and with full shell model calculations. Limitations and possible improvements of the schematic Hamiltonian are discussed. "
"We investigate with the help of analytical and numerical methods the reaction A+A->A on a one-dimensional lattice opened at one end and with an input of particles at the other end. We show that if the diffusion rates to the left and to the right are equal, for large x, the particle concentration c(x) behaves like As/x (x measures the distance to the input end). If the diffusion rate in the direction pointing away from the source is larger than the one corresponding to the opposite direction the particle concentration behaves like Aa/sqrt(x). The constants As and Aa are independent of the input and the two coagulation rates. The universality of Aa comes as a surprise since in the asymmetric case the system has a massive spectrum. "
We derive a general quasiclassical approach for long-range magnetic-field quantization effects in superconductors. The method is applied to superclean d-wave superconductors in the mixed state. We study the delocalized states with energies $\epsilon \gg \Delta_{0}\sqrt{H/H_{c2}}$. We find that the energy spectrum consists of narrow energy bands whose centers are located at the Landau levels calculated in absence of the vortex potential. We show that transitions between the states belonging to the different Landau levels give rise to resonances in the a.c. quasiparticle conductivity and in the a.c. vortex friction.
"In nature and society problems arise when different interests are difficult to reconcile, which are modeled in game theory. While most applications assume uncorrelated games, a more detailed modeling is necessary to consider the correlations that influence the decisions of the players. The current theory for correlated games, however, enforces the players to obey the instructions from a third party or ""correlation device"" to reach equilibrium, but this cannot be achieved for all initial correlations. We extend here the existing framework of correlated games and find that there are other interesting and previously unknown Nash equilibria that make use of correlations to obtain the best payoff. This is achieved by allowing the players the freedom to follow or not to follow the suggestions of the correlation device. By assigning independent probabilities to follow every possible suggestion, the players engage in a response game that turns out to have a rich structure of Nash equilibria that goes beyond the correlated equilibrium and mixed-strategy solutions. We determine the Nash equilibria for all possible correlated Snowdrift games, which we find to be describable by Ising Models in thermal equilibrium. We believe that our approach paves the way to a study of correlations in games that uncovers the existence of interesting underlying interaction mechanisms, without compromising the independence of the players. "
"Let $X$ be a compact toric extremal K\""ahler manifold. Using the work of Sz\'ekelyhidi, we provide a combinatorial criterion on the fan describing $X$ to ensure the existence of complex deformations of $X$ that carry extremal metrics. As an example, we find new CSC metrics on 4-points blow-ups of $\C\P^1\times\C\P^1$. "
"Autoignition delay times have been measured in a rapid compression machine at Lille at temperatures after compression from 630 to 840 K, pressures from 8 to 14 bar, \Phi = 1 and for a iso octane/1 hexene mixture containing 82% iso-octane and 18% 1 hexene. Results have shown that this mixture is strongly more reactive than pure iso-octane, but less reactive than pure 1 hexene. It exhibits a classical low temperature behaviour, with the appearance of cool flame and a negative temperature coefficient region. The composition of the reactive mixture obtained after the cool flame has also been determined. A detailed kinetic model has been obtained by using the system EXGAS, developed in Nancy for the automatic generation of kinetic mechanisms, and an acceptable agreement with the experimental results has been obtained both for autoignition delay times and for the distribution of products. A flow rate analysis reveals that the crossed reactions between species coming from both reactants (like H-abstractions or combinations) are negligible in the main flow consumption of the studied hydrocarbons. The ways of formation of the main primary products observed and the most sensitive rate constants have been identified. "
"We present a framework for clustering with cluster-specific feature selection. The framework, CRAFT, is derived from asymptotic log posterior formulations of nonparametric MAP-based clustering models. CRAFT handles assorted data, i.e., both numeric and categorical data, and the underlying objective functions are intuitively appealing. The resulting algorithm is simple to implement and scales nicely, requires minimal parameter tuning, obviates the need to specify the number of clusters a priori, and compares favorably with other methods on real datasets. "
"I review some recent work on low-mass star formation, with an emphasis on theory, basic principles, and unresolved questions. Star formation is both a gravitational fragmentation problem as well as an accretion problem. Molecular cloud structure can be understood as a fragmentation process driven by the interplay of turbulence, magnetic fields, and gravity (acting on either a dynamical or ambipolar-diffusion time scale). This results in a natural way to understand filamentary structure as magnetic ribbons that have an apparent width that scales differently than the Jeans length. Recent work also shows that stellar mass accretion through a disk is episodic. We show through numerical simulations that bursts of FU Ori type may be clustered, since the clump that accretes to the center is tidally sheared apart in its last stage of infall. Finally, we utilize a simplified model of stellar mass accretion and accretion termination to derive an analytic form for the initial mass function that has a lognormal-like body and a power-law tail. This scenario is consistent with an expectation of a larger number of substellar objects than may have been previously detected. "
"In this paper, we examine in a unified fashion dissipative transport in strongly correlated systems. We thereby demonstrate the connection between ""bad metals"" (such as the high temperature superconductors) and ""perfect fluids"" (such as the ultracold Fermi gases, near unitarity). One motivation of this work is to communicate to the high energy physics community some of the central unsolved problems in high $T_c$ superconductors. Because of interest in the nearly perfect fluidity of the cold gases and because of new tools such as the AdS/CFT correspondence, this better communication may lead to important progress in a variety of different fields. A second motivation is to draw attention to the great power of transport measurements which more directly reflect the excitation spectrum than, say, thermodynamics and thus strongly constrain microscopic theories of correlated fermionic superfluids. Our calculations show that bad metal and perfect fluid behavior is associated with the presence of a normal state excitation gap which suppresses the effective number of carriers leading to anomalously low conductivity and viscosity above the transition temperature $T_c$. Below $T_c$ we demonstrate that the condensate collective modes (""phonons"") do not couple to transverse probes such as the shear viscosity. As a result, our calculated shear viscosity at low $T$ becomes arbitrarily small as observed in experiments. In both homogeneous and trap calculations we do not find the upturn in $\eta$ or $\eta/s$ (where $s$ is the entropy density) found in most theories. In the process of these studies we demonstrate compatibility with the transverse sum rule and find reasonable agreement with both viscosity and cuprate conductivity experiments. "
"Quasi-Optical Characterization of Dielectric and Ferrite Materials are made in the millimeter-submillimeter range by using a Quasi-Optical (QO) benches that can be relatively compact, typically of the order 10cm wide and 1m long. "
We present a precise determination of the leptonic decay constant F_D(s) of the D(s)-meson in quenched lattice QCD. This work is particularly focused on the analysis and discussion of all sources of systematic errors. We simulate directly at the physical quark masses for five different lattice spacings between 0.1fm and 0.03fm using O(a)-improvement. The finest lattice is still work in progress. After taking the continuum limit and setting the scale with the Kaon decay constant F_K=160MeV we arrive at a value of F_D(s)=252(9)MeV. Setting the scale with the nucleon mass instead leads to a decrease of about 20MeV of F_D(s).
"Let (X,L) be a polarized manifold of dimension n. In this paper, by using the ith sectional geometric genus and the ith \Delta-genus, we will give a numerical characterization of (X,L) with K_{X}=-(n-i)L for the following cases (i) i=2, (ii) i=3 and n \geq 5, (iii) max{2, dim Bs|L|+2} \leq i \leq n-1.

"In this manuscript we present an in vitro model based on agarose gel that can be used to simulate a dirty, oily, bloody, and morphologically complex surface of, for example, an open wound. We show this models effectiveness in simulating depth of penetration of reactive species generated in plasma deep into tissue of a rat and confirm the penetration depths with agarose gel model. We envision that in the future such a model could be used to study plasma discharges (and other modalities) and minimize the use of live animals: plasma can be optimized on the agarose gel wound model and then finally verified using an actual wound. "
"In this work, we consider the problem of estimating a behaviour policy for use in Off-Policy Policy Evaluation (OPE) when the true behaviour policy is unknown. Via a series of empirical studies, we demonstrate how accurate OPE is strongly dependent on the calibration of estimated behaviour policy models: how precisely the behaviour policy is estimated from data. We show how powerful parametric models such as neural networks can result in highly uncalibrated behaviour policy models on a real-world medical dataset, and illustrate how a simple, non-parametric, k-nearest neighbours model produces better calibrated behaviour policy estimates and can be used to obtain superior importance sampling-based OPE estimates. "
"In this paper, we present the most extensive evaluation of blockchain system to date. To achieve scalability across servers in more than 10 countries located on 4 different continents, we drastically revisited Byzantine fault tolerant blockchains and verification of signatures. The resulting blockchain, called the Red Belly Blockchain (RBBC), commits more than a hundred thousand transactions issued by permissionless nodes. These transactions are grouped into blocks within few seconds through a partially synchronous consensus run by permissioned nodes. It prevents double spending by guaranteeing that a unique block is decided at any given index of the chain in a deterministic way by all participants. We compared the performance of RBBC against traditional Byzantine fault tolerant alternatives and more recent randomized solutions. In the same geo-distributed environment with low-end machines, we noticed two interesting comparisons: (i) the RBBC throughput scales to hundreds of machines whereas the classic 3-step leader-based BFT state machine used by consortium blockchains cannot scale to 40 identically configured nodes; (ii) RBBC guarantees transaction finality in 3 seconds and experiences a third of the latency that randomized-based solutions like HoneyBadgerBFT can offer. This empirical evaluation demonstrates that blockchain scalability can be achieved without sacrificing security. "
"In 1-out-of-2 oblivious transfer (OT), Alice inputs numbers x_0, x_1, Bob inputs a bit b and outputs x_b. Secure OT requires that Alice and Bob learn nothing about b and x_{\bar{b}}, respectively. We define spacetime-constrained oblivious transfer (SCOT) as OT in Minkowski spacetime in which Bob must output x_b within R_b, where R_0 and R_1 are fixed spacelike separated spacetime regions. We show that unconditionally secure SCOT is impossible with classical protocols in Minkowski (or Galilean) spacetime, or with quantum protocols in Galilean spacetime. We describe a quantum SCOT protocol in Minkowski spacetime, and we show it unconditionally secure. "
"Porous poly(ionic liquid) membranes that were prepared via electrostatic cross-linking were subsequently covalently cross-linked via formation of a 1,3,5-triazine network. The additional covalent cross-links do not affect the pore size and pore size distribution of the membranes and stabilize them towards salt solutions of high ionic strength, enabling the membranes to work in a broader environmental window.

We present a method to develop a Hodge theory for tangential cohomology of foliations by mimicing Witten's approach to ordinary Morse theory by perturbations of the Laplacian
"We demonstrate a ""membrane in the middle"" optomechanical system using a silicon nitride membrane patterned as a subwavelength grating. The grating has a reflectivity of over 99.8%, effectively creating two sub-cavities, with free spectral ranges of 6 GHz, optically coupled via photon tunneling. Measurements of the transmission and reflection spectra show an avoided crossing where the two sub-cavities simultaneously come into resonance, with a frequency splitting of 54 MHz. We derive expressions for the lineshapes of the symmetric and antisymmetric modes at the avoided crossing, and infer the grating reflection, transmission, absorption, and scattering through comparison with the experimental data.

"In this note we define a Stanley-Reisner ring for quasi-arithmetic matroids and more general structures. To this end, we define two types of CW complexes associated with a quasi-arithmetic matroid that generalize independence complexes of matroids. Then we use Stanley's construction of Stanley-Reisner rings for simplicial posets. "
"Some mobile sensor network applications require the sensor nodes to transfer their trajectories to a data sink. This paper proposes an adaptive trajectory (lossy) compression algorithm based on compressive sensing. The algorithm has two innovative elements. First, we propose a method to compute a deterministic projection matrix from a learnt dictionary. Second, we propose a method for the mobile nodes to adaptively predict the number of projections needed based on the speed of the mobile nodes. Extensive evaluation of the proposed algorithm using 6 datasets shows that our proposed algorithm can achieve sub-metre accuracy. In addition, our method of computing projection matrices outperforms two existing methods. Finally, comparison of our algorithm against a state-of-the-art trajectory compression algorithm show that our algorithm can reduce the error by 10-60 cm for the same compression ratio. "
"The Grateful Dead were an American band that was born out of the San Francisco, California psychedelic movement of the 1960s. The band played music together from 1965 to 1995 and is well known for concert performances containing extended improvisations and long and unique set lists. This article presents a comparative analysis between 1,590 of the Grateful Dead's concert set lists from 1972 to 1995 and 2,616,990 last.fm Grateful Dead listening events from August 2005 to October 2007. While there is a strong correlation between how songs were played in concert and how they are listened to by last.fm members, the outlying songs in this trend identify interesting aspects of the band and their fans 10 years after the band's dissolution.

"High-sensitivity radio-frequency observations of millisecond pulsars usually show stochastic, broadband, pulse-shape variations intrinsic to the pulsar emission process. These variations induce jitter noise in pulsar timing observations; understanding the properties of this noise is of particular importance for the effort to detect gravitational waves with pulsar timing arrays. We assess the short-term profile and timing stability of 22 millisecond pulsars that are part of the Parkes Pulsar Timing Array sample by examining intra-observation arrival time variability and single-pulse phenomenology. In 7 of the 22 pulsars, in the band centred at approximately 1400MHz, we find that the brightest observations are limited by intrinsic jitter. We find consistent results, either detections or upper limits, for jitter noise in other frequency bands. PSR J1909-3744 shows the lowest levels of jitter noise, which we estimate to contribute $\sim$10 ns root mean square error to the arrival times for hour-duration observations. Larger levels of jitter noise are found in pulsars with wider pulses and distributions of pulse intensities. The jitter noise in PSR J0437-4715 decorrelates over a bandwidth of $\sim$2 GHz. We show that the uncertainties associated with timing pulsar models can be improved by including physically motivated jitter uncertainties. Pulse-shape variations will limit the timing precision at future, more sensitive, telescopes; it is imperative to account for this noise when designing instrumentation and timing campaigns for these facilities.

"We discuss the process by which energy, initially evenly distributed in a nonlinear lattice, can localize itself into large amplitude excitations. We show that, the standard modulational instability mechanism, which can initiate the process by the formation of small amplitude breathers, is completed efficiently, in the presence of discreteness, by energy exchange mechanisms between the nonlinear excitations which favor systematically the growth of the larger excitations. The process is however self regulated because the large amplitude excitations are finally trapped by the Peierls-Nabarro potential. "
"In this paper we study the art gallery problem, which is one of the fundamental problems in computational geometry. The objective is to place a minimum number of guards inside a simple polygon such that the guards together can see the whole polygon. We say that a guard at position $x$ sees a point $y$ if the line segment $xy$ is fully contained in the polygon. Despite an extensive study of the art gallery problem, it remained an open question whether there are polygons given by integer coordinates that require guard positions with irrational coordinates in any optimal solution. We give a positive answer to this question by constructing a monotone polygon with integer coordinates that can be guarded by three guards only when we allow to place the guards at points with irrational coordinates. Otherwise, four guards are needed. By extending this example, we show that for every $n$, there is polygon which can be guarded by $3n$ guards with irrational coordinates but need $4n$ guards if the coordinates have to be rational. Subsequently, we show that there are rectilinear polygons given by integer coordinates that require guards with irrational coordinates in any optimal solution. "
"The measures of distances between points in a Hilbert space are one of the basic theoretical concepts used to characterize properties of a quantum system with respect to some etalon state. These are not only used in studying fidelity of signal transmission and basic quantum phenomena but also applied in measuring quantum correlations, and also in quantum machine learning. The values of quantum distance measures are very difficult to determine without completely reconstructing the state. Here we demonstrate an interferometric approach to measuring distances between quantum states that in some cases can outperform quantum state tomography. We propose a direct experimental method to estimate such distance measures between two unknown two-qubit mixed states as Uhlmann-Jozsa fidelity (or the Bures distance), the Hilbert-Schmidt distance, and the trace distance. The fidelity is estimated via the measurement of the upper and lower bounds of the fidelity, which are referred to as the superfidelity and subfidelity, respectively. Our method is based on the multiparticle interactions (i.e., interference) between copies of the unknown pairs of qubits. "
"Let G be a real reductive Lie group with maximal compact sub- group K. We generalize the usual notion of Dirac index to a twisted version, which is nontrivial even in case G and K do not have equal rank. We compute ordinary and twisted indices of standard modules. As applications, we study extensions of Harish-Chandra modules and twisted characters. "
"Learning strategies for imperfect information games from samples of interaction is a challenging problem. A common method for this setting, Monte Carlo Counterfactual Regret Minimization (MCCFR), can have slow long-term convergence rates due to high variance. In this paper, we introduce a variance reduction technique (VR-MCCFR) that applies to any sampling variant of MCCFR. Using this technique, per-iteration estimated values and updates are reformulated as a function of sampled values and state-action baselines, similar to their use in policy gradient reinforcement learning. The new formulation allows estimates to be bootstrapped from other estimates within the same episode, propagating the benefits of baselines along the sampled trajectory; the estimates remain unbiased even when bootstrapping from other estimates. Finally, we show that given a perfect baseline, the variance of the value estimates can be reduced to zero. Experimental evaluation shows that VR-MCCFR brings an order of magnitude speedup, while the empirical variance decreases by three orders of magnitude. The decreased variance allows for the first time CFR+ to be used with sampling, increasing the speedup to two orders of magnitude. "
"In this short note, the identity in law, which was obtained by P. Salminen, between on one hand, the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process with parameter gamma, killed when it reaches 0, and on the other hand, the 3-dimensional radial Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process killed exponentially at rate gamma and conditioned to hit 0, is derived from a simple absolute continuity relationship. "
"We show differentiability of a class of Geroch's volume functions on globally hyperbolic manifolds. Furthermore, we prove that every volume function satisfies a local anti-Lipschitz condition over causal curves, and that locally Lipschitz time functions which are locally anti-Lipschitz can be uniformly approximated by smooth time functions with timelike gradient. Finally, we prove that in stably causal spacetimes Hawking's time function can be uniformly approximated by smooth time functions with timelike gradient. "
"Unification ideas suggest an integral treatment of fermion and boson spin and gauge-group degrees of freedom. Hence, a generalized quantum field equation, based on Dirac's, is proposed and investigated which contains gauge and flavor symmetries, determines vector gauge field and fermion solution representations, and fixes their mode of interaction. The simplest extension of the theory with a 6-dimensional Clifford algebra predicts an SU(2)_L X U(1) symmetry, which is associated with the isospin and the hypercharge, their vector carriers, two-flavor charged and chargeless leptons, and scalar particles. A mass term produces breaking of the symmetry to an electromagnetic U(1), and a Weinberg's angle theta_W with sin^2(theta_W)=.25 . A more realistic 8-d extension gives coupling constants of the respective groups g=1/sqrt 2~.707 and g'=1/sqrt 6~.408, with the same theta_W. "
"The OPERA experiment is based on a hybrid technology combining electronic detectors and nuclear emulsions. OPERA collected muon-neutrino interactions during the 2008 and 2009 physics runs of the CNGS neutrino beam, produced at CERN with an energy range of about 5-35 GeV. A total of $5.3 \times 10^{19}$ protons on target equivalent luminosity has been analysed with the OPERA electronic detectors: scintillator strips target trackers and magnetic muon spectrometers equipped with resistive plate gas chambers and drift tubes, allowing a detailed reconstruction of muon-neutrino interactions. Charged Current (CC) and Neutral Current (NC) interactions are identified, using the measurements in the electronic detectors, and the NC/CC ratio is computed. The momentum distribution and the charge of the muon tracks produced in CC interactions are analysed. Calorimetric measurements of the visible energy are performed for both the CC and NC samples. For CC events the Bjorken-$y$ distribution and the hadronic shower profile are computed. The results are compared to a detailed Monte Carlo simulation of the electronic detectors' response. "
"The isospin-invariant interacting boson model IBM-3 is analyzed in situations where $SU_T(3)$ charge symmetry [or, equivalently, $U_L(6)$ $sd$ symmetry] is conserved. Analytic expressions for energies, electromagnetic transitions, two-nucleon transfer probabilities, and boson-number expectation values are obtained for the three possible dynamical symmetry limits, U(5), SU(3), and O(6). Results found in IBM-3 are related to corresponding ones in IBM-1 and IBM-2. Numerical calculations are presented for $f_{7/2}$-shell nuclei and some features that distinguish IBM-3 from its predecessors IBM-1 and IBM-2 are pointed out. "
A linear ion trap setup has been developed for studying the dynamics of trapped ion cloud and thereby realizing possible systematics of a high precision measurement on a single ion within it. The dynamics of molecular nitrogen ion cloud has been investigated to extract the characteristics of the trap setup. The stability of trap operation has been studied with observation of narrow nonlinear resonances pointing out the region of instabilities within the broad stability region. The secular frequency has been measured and the motional spectra of trapped ion oscillation have been obtained by using electric dipole excitation. It is applied to study the space charge effect and the axial coupling in the radial plane.
"The Grassmann path integral approach is used to calculate exact partition functions of the Ising model on MxN square (sq), plane triangular (pt) and honeycomb (hc) lattices with periodic-periodic (pp), periodic-antiperiodic (pa), antiperiodic-periodic (ap) and antiperiodic-antiperiodic (aa) boundary conditions. The partition functions are used to calculate and plot the specific heat, $C/k_B$, as a function of the temperature, $\theta =k_BT/J$. We find that for the NxN sq lattice, $C/k_B$ for pa and ap boundary conditions are different from those for aa boundary conditions, but for the NxN pt and hc lattices, $C/k_B$ for ap, pa, and aa boundary conditions have the same values. Our exact partition functions might also be useful for understanding the effects of lattice structures and boundary conditions on critical finite-size corrections of the Ising model. "
We have investigated the low energy nuclear spin excitations in NdMn$_2$Si$_2$ and NdMn$_2$Ge$_2$ by high resolution inelastic neutron scattering. Previous neutron diffraction investigations gave ambiguous results about Nd magnetic ordering at low temperatures. The present element-specific technique gave direct evidence for the magnetic ordering of Nd ions. We found considerable difference in the process of the Nd magnetic ordering at low temperature in NdMn$_2$Si$_2$ and NdMn$_2$Ge$_2$. Our results are consistent with those of magnetization and recent neutron diffraction measurements.
"Let $R=K[t;\sigma]$, where $K/F$ is a field extension and $ \sigma $ an automorphism of $K$. We study the eigenspace of a skew polynomial $f\in K[t;\sigma]$ employing methods from nonassociative algebra, and obtain lower bounds on its dimension. When $K/F$ is a cyclic Galois extension of degree $n$ with Galois group ${\rm Gal}(K/F)=\langle \sigma \rangle$, we show that the eigenspace of an irreducible polynomial $f$ of degree $m$ is a central simple algebra over a field extension of $F$ and is determined by the minimal central left multiple of $f$. "
"We present an extensive set of photometric and spectroscopic data for SN 2009jf, a nearby Type Ib supernova, spanning from ~20 days before B-band maximum to one year after maximum. We show that SN 2009jf is a slow evolving and energetic stripped-envelope SN and is likely from a massive progenitor (25-30 solar masses). The large progenitor's mass allows us to explain the complete hydrogen plus helium stripping without invoking the presence of a binary companion. The supernova occurred close to a young cluster, in a crowded environment with ongoing star-formation. The specroscopic similarity with the He-poor Type Ic SN 2007gr suggests a common progenitor for some supernovae Ib and Ic. The nebular spectra of SN 2009jf are consistent with an asymmetric explosion, with an off-center dense core. We also find evidence that He-rich Ib supernovae have a rise time longer than other stripped-envelope supernovae, however confirmation of this result and further observations are needed. "
"Using first-principles calculations combined with Boltzmann transport theory, we investigate the effects of topological edge states on the thermoelectric properties of Bi nanoribbons. It is found that there is a competition between the edge and bulk contributions to the Seebeck coefficients. However, the electronic transport of the system is dominated by the edge states because of its much larger electrical conductivity. As a consequence, a room temperature value exceeding 3.0 could be achieved for both p- and n-type systems when the relaxation time ratio between the edge and the bulk states is tuned to be 1000. Our theoretical study suggests that the utilization of topological edge states might be a promising approach to cross the threshold of the industrial application of thermoelectricity. "
"In order to study the Hochschild cohomology of triangular algebras $\mathcal T$, we construct a spectral sequence, whose terms are parametrized by the length of the trajectories of the quiver associated with $\mathcal T$, and which converges to $HH^*(\mathcal T)$. We explicit its components, and its differentials which are sums of cup products. In case $n=3$, we study some properties of the differential at level 2. Finally, we apply these results to the paths algebra of a quiver without oriented cycles, and link them with previous results on the incidence algebra of a simplicial complex, and more generally on the morphisms algebra of certain categories. "
"Multiple bosons undergoing coherent evolution in a coupled network of sites constitute a so-called quantum walk system. The simplest example of such a two-particle interference is the celebrated Hong-Ou-Mandel interference. When scaling to larger boson numbers, simulating the exact distribution of bosons has been shown, under reasonable assumptions, to be exponentially hard. We analyze the feasibility and expected performance of a globally connected superconducting resonator based quantum walk system, using the known characteristics of state-of-the-art components. We simulate the sensitivity of such a system to decay processes and to perturbations and compare with coherent input states. "
"We find and study four kinds of five-parameter family of six-dimensional coupled Painlev\'e III systems with affine Weyl group symmetry of types $D_5^{(1)},B_5^{(1)}$ and $D_6^{(2)}$. We show that each system is equivalent by an explicit birational and symplectic transformation, respectively. We also show that we characterize each system from the viewpoint of holomorphy. "
"Wireless systems, which include cellular phones, have become an essential part of the modern life. However the mounting evidence that cellular radiation might adversely affect the health of its users, leads to a growing concern among authorities and the general public. Radiating antennas in the proximity of the user, such as antennas of mobile phones are of special interest for this matter. In this paper we suggest a new architecture for wireless networks, aiming at minimal emission from mobile stations, without any additional radiation sources. The new architecture, dubbed Green Cellular, abandons the classical transceiver base station design and suggests the augmentation of transceiver base stations with receive only devices. These devices, dubbed Green Antennas, are not aiming at coverage extension but rather at minimizing the emission from mobile stations. We discuss the implications of the Green Cellular architecture on 3G and 4G cellular technologies. We conclude by showing that employing the Green Cellular approach may lead to a significant decrease in the emission from mobile stations, especially in indoor scenarios. This is achieved without exposing the user to any additional radiation source. "
"We present extensions to a continuous-state dependency parsing method that makes it applicable to morphologically rich languages. Starting with a high-performance transition-based parser that uses long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks to learn representations of the parser state, we replace lookup-based word representations with representations constructed from the orthographic representations of the words, also using LSTMs. This allows statistical sharing across word forms that are similar on the surface. Experiments for morphologically rich languages show that the parsing model benefits from incorporating the character-based encodings of words. "
"We consider a Black-Scholes type equation arising on a pricing model for a multi-asset option with general transaction costs. The pioneering work of Leland is thus extended in two different ways: on the one hand, the problem is multi-dimensional since it involves different underlying assets; on the other hand, the transaction costs are not assumed to be constant (i.e. a fixed proportion of the traded quantity). In this work, we generalize Leland's condition and prove the existence of a viscosity solution for the corresponding fully nonlinear initial value problem using Perron method. Moreover, we develop a numerical ADI scheme to find an approximated solution. We apply this method on a specific multi-asset derivative and we obtain the option price under different pricing scenarios. "
"Let X be a nonsingular algebraic variety in characteristic zero. To an effective divisor on X Kontsevich has associated a certain 'motivic integral', living in a completion of the Grothendieck ring of algebraic varieties. He used this invariant to show that birational Calabi-Yau varieties have the same Hodge numbers. Then Denef and Loeser introduced the motivic (Igusa) zeta function, associated to a regular function on X, which specializes to both the classical p-adic Igusa zeta function and the topological zeta function, and also to Kontsevich's invariant. This paper treats a generalization to singular varieties. Batyrev already considered such a 'Kontsevich invariant' for log terminal varieties (on the level of Hodge polynomials instead of in the Grothendieck ring), and previously we introduced a motivic zeta function on normal surface germs. Here on any Q-Gorenstein variety X we associate a motivic zeta function and a 'Kontsevich invariant' to effective Q-Cartier divisors on X whose support contains the singular locus of X. "
"We have investigated the influence of an increasing in-plane magnetic field on the states at half-filling of Landau levels ($\nu$ = 11/2, 9/2, 7/2, and 5/2) of a two-dimensional electron system. In the electrically anisotropic phase at $\nu$ = 9/2 and 11/2 an in-plane magnetic field of $\sim$ 1-2 T overcomes its initial pinning to the crystal lattice and {\it reorient} this phase. In the initially isotropic phases at $\nu$ = 5/2 and 7/2 an in-plane magnetic field {\it induces} a strong electrical anisotropy. In all cases, for high in-plane fields, the high resistance axis is parallel to the direction of the in-plane field. "
"We study randomly stopped sums via their asymptotic scales. First, finiteness of moments is considered. To generalise this study, asymptotic scales applicable to the class of all heavy-tailed random variables are used. The stopping is assumed to be independent of the underlying process, which is a random walk. The main result enables one to identify whether the asymptotic behaviour of a stopped sum is dominated by the increment, or the stopping variable. As a consequence of this result, new sufficient conditions for the moment determinacy of compounded sums are obtained. "
Using an analytically tractable lattice model for reaction-diffusion processes of hard-core particles we demonstrate that under nonequilibrium conditions phase coexistence may arise even if the system is effectively one-dimensional as e.g. in the channel system of some zeolites or in artificial optical lattices. In our model involving two species of particles a steady-state particle current is maintained by a density gradient between the channel boundaries and by the influence of an external driving force. This leads to the development of a fluctuating but always microscopically sharp interface between two domains of different densities which are fixed by the boundary chemical potentials. The internal structure of the interface becomes very simple for strong driving force. We calculate the drift velocity and diffusion coefficient of the interface in terms of the microscopic model parameters.
In the epsilon-regime of lattice QCD one can get an accurate measurement of the pion decay constant F_pi by monitoring how just one single Dirac operator eigenvalue splits into two when subjected to two different external vector sources. Because we choose imaginary chemical potentials our Dirac eigenvalues remain real. Based on the relevant chiral Random Two-Matrix Theory we derive individual eigenvalue distributions in terms of density correlations functions to leading order in the finite-volume epsilon-expansion. As a simple byproduct we also show how the associated individual Dirac eigenvalue distributions and their correlations can be computed directly from the effective chiral Lagrangian.
We present numerical hydrodynamical models of the effects of planets or brown dwarfs orbiting within the extended atmosphere and wind formation zone of Mira variables. We find time-dependent wake dynamics and episodic accretion phenomena which may give rise to observable optical events and affect SiO maser emission.
"The so-called light logics have been introduced as logical systems enjoying quite remarkable normalization properties. Designing a type assignment system for pure lambda calculus from these logics, however, is problematic. In this paper we show that shifting from usual call-by-name to call-by-value lambda calculus allows regaining strong connections with the underlying logic. This will be done in the context of Elementary Affine Logic (EAL), designing a type system in natural deduction style assigning EAL formulae to lambda terms. "
"In this paper, we introduce two golden ratio algorithms with new stepsize rules for solving pseudomonotone and Lipschitz variational inequalities in finite dimensional Hilbert spaces. The presented stepsize rules allow the resulting algorithms to work without the prior knowledge of the Lipschitz constant of operator. The first algorithm uses a sequence of stepsizes which is previously chosen, diminishing and non-summable. While the stepsizes in the second one are updated at each iteration and by a simple computation. A special point is that the sequence of stepsizes generated by the second algorithm is separated from zero. The convergence as well as the convergence rate of the proposed algorithms are established under some standard conditions. Also, we give several numerical results to show the behavior of the algorithms in comparisons with other algorithms. "
"We provide a rigorous derivation of the compressible Reynolds system as a singular limit of the compressible (barotropic) Navier-Stokes system on a thin domain. In particular, the existence of solutions to the Navier-Stokes system with non-homogeneous boundary conditions is shown that may be of independent interest. Our approach is based on new a priori bounds available for the pressure law of hard sphere type. Finally, uniqueness for the limit problem is established in the 1D case. "
We introduce a notion of normal form for transversely projective structures of singular foliations on complex manifolds. Our first main result says that this normal form exists and is unique when ambient space is two-dimensional. From this result one obtains a natural way to produce invariants for transversely projective foliations on surfaces. Our second main result says that on projective surfaces one can construct singular transversely projective foliations with prescribed monodromy.
We give a systematic method for computation of Beilinson's regulator map on K_1 of a fibration of curves which has a totally degenerate semistable fiber.
"In this article, we analyze the strong vertexes $\Sigma_{c}^{*}ND$ and $\Sigma_{b}^{*}NB$ using the three-point QCD sum rules under the Dirac structure of $q\!\!\!/p\!\!\!/\gamma_{\mu}$. We perform our analysis by considering the contributions of the perturbative part and the condensate terms of $<\overline{q}q>$ and $<\frac{\alpha_{s}}{\pi}GG>$. After the form factors are calculated, they are then fitted into analytical functions which are used to get the strong coupling constants for these two vertexes. The final results are $g_{\Sigma_{c}^{*}ND}=7.19^{+8.49}_{-3.11}\pm1.76$ and $g_{\Sigma_{b}^{*}NB}=10.54^{+15.59}_{-5.23}\pm1.82$. "
"In this paper, we consider the community detection problem under either the stochastic block model (SBM) assumption or the degree-correlated stochastic block model (DCSBM) assumption. The modularity maximization formulation for the community detection problem is NP-hard in general. In this paper, we propose a sparse and low-rank completely positive relaxation for the modularity maximization problem, we then develop an efficient row-by-row (RBR) type block coordinate descent (BCD) algorithm to solve the relaxation and prove an $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{N})$ convergence rate to a stationary point where $N$ is the number of iterations. A fast rounding scheme is constructed to retrieve the community structure from the solution. Non-asymptotic high probability bounds on the misclassification rate are established to justify our approach. We further develop an asynchronous parallel RBR algorithm to speed up the convergence. Extensive numerical experiments on both synthetic and real world networks show that the proposed approach enjoys advantages in both clustering accuracy and numerical efficiency. Our numerical results indicate that the newly proposed method is a quite competitive alternative for community detection on sparse networks with over 50 million nodes. "
"Erbium-167-doped yttrium orthosilicate is an ideal candidate for a microwave-addressed quantum memory due to its telecom wavelength optical transition and hyperfine structure with and without an applied magnetic field. However, to date there has been little investigation in coherence times for transitions around zero magnetic field, or for hyperfine structure other than from the ground state. Through the use of Raman heterodyne spectroscopy, we have identified transitions at zero magnetic field with a small dependence on field that are suitable for detecting spin echoes for both the ground and excited state. We measured coherence times of transitions at 879.4 MHz and 896.7 MHz as 370 $\mu$s and 1.4 ms respectively at 3.2 K. This is a 100-fold increase in coherence time compared to previous measurements at the same dopant concentration and 200 times greater than the even isotopes of erbium-doped yttrium orthosilicate previously used to demonstrate a microwave memory. "
"We report on the results of the calculations of the low energy excitation patterns for three Zirconium isotopes, viz. $^{80}$Zr$_{40}$, $^{96}$Zr$_{56}$ and $^{110}$Zr$_{70}$, reported by other authors to be doubly-magic tetrahedral nuclei (with tetrahedral magic numbers $Z$=40 and $N$=40, 56 and 70). We employ the realistic Gogny effective interactions using three variants of their parametrisation and the particle-number, parity and the angular-momentum projection techniques. We confirm quantitatively that the resulting spectra directly follow the pattern expected from the group theory considerations for the tetrahedral symmetric quantum objects. We also find out that, for all the nuclei studied, the correlation energy obtained after the angular momentum projection is very large for the tetrahedral deformation as well as other octupole deformations. The lowering of the energies of the resulting configurations is considerable, i.e. by about 10 MeV or even more, once again confirming the significance of the angular-momentum projections techniques in the mean-field nuclear structure calculations. "
"Energy problems are important in the formal analysis of embedded or autonomous systems. Using recent results on star-continuous Kleene omega-algebras, we show here that energy problems can be solved by algebraic manipulations on the transition matrix of energy automata. To this end, we prove general results about certain classes of finitely additive functions on complete lattices which should be of a more general interest. "
"We propose a model of gravity in which a General Relativity metric tensor and an effective metric generated from a single scalar formulated in Geometric Scalar Gravity are mixed. We show that the model yields the exact Schwarzschild solution, along with accelerating behavior of scale factors in cosmological solutions. "
"We present high-resolution Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT) HI observations and deep Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) optical imaging of two galaxy groups: NGC 4725/47 and NGC 3166/9. These data are part of a multi-wavelength unbiased survey of the gas-rich dwarf galaxy populations in three nearby interacting galaxy groups. The NGC 4725/47 group hosts two tidal knots and one dIrr. Both tidal knots are located within a prominent HI tidal tail, appear to have sufficient mass (M_gas~10^8 M_sol) to evolve into long-lived tidal dwarf galaxies (TDGs) and are fairly young in age. The NGC 3166/9 group contains a TDG candidate, AGC 208457, at least three dIrrs and four HI knots. Deep CFHT imaging confirms that the optical component of AGC 208457 is bluer -- with a 0.28 mag g-r colour -- and a few Gyr younger than its purported parent galaxies. Combining the results for these groups with those from the NGC 871/6/7 group reported earlier, we find that the HI properties, estimated stellar ages and baryonic content of the gas-rich dwarfs clearly distinguish tidal features from their classical counterparts. We optimistically identify four potentially long-lived tidal objects associated to three separate pairs of interacting galaxies, implying that TDGs are not readily produced during interaction events as suggested by some recent simulations. The tidal objects examined in this survey also appear to have a wider variety of properties than TDGs of similar mass formed in current simulations of interacting galaxies, which could be the result of pre- or post-formation environmental influences. "
"We analyze the coupled quintessence in the light of the linear dynamical systems theory, with two different interactions: i) proportional to the energy density of the dark energy and ii) proportional to the sum of the energy densities of the dark matter and dark energy. The results presented here enlarge the previous analyses in the literature, wherein the interaction has been only proportional to the energy density of the dark matter. In the first case it is possible to get the well-known sequence of cosmological eras. For the second interaction only the radiation and the dark energy era can be described by the fixed points. Therefore, from the point-of-view of the dynamical system theory, the interaction proportional to the sum of the energy densities of the dark matter and dark energy does not describe the universe we live in. "
"Due to the availability of large molecular data-sets, covariance models are increasingly used to describe the structure of genetic variation as an alternative to more heavily parametrised biological models. We focus here on a class of parametric covariance models that received sustained attention lately and show that the conditions under which they are valid mathematical models have been overlooked so far. We provide rigorous results for the construction of valid covariance models in this family. We also outline how to construct alternative covariance models for the analysis of geographical variation that are both mathematically well behaved and easily implementable. "
"We analyze the dynamics of the forced singularly perturbed differential equation of Duffing's type. We explain the appearance of the large frequency nonlinear oscillations of the solutions. It is shown that the frequency can be controlled by a small parameter at the highest derivative. We give some generalizations of results obtained recently by B.S. Wu, W.P. Sun and C.W. Lim, Analytical approximations to the double-well Duffing oscillator in large amplitude oscillations, Journal of Sound and Vibration, Volume 307, Issues 3-5, (2007), pp. 953-960. The new method for an analysis of the nonlinear oscillations which is based on the dynamic change of coordinates is proposed. "
"Using an extended version of the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model we build a simple description of the baryons as diquark-quark bound states. First, a description of the diquarks in a dense and hot medium is presented. Then, we introduce the formalism for the baryons based on the Faddeev equation associated with the so-called `` static approximation'' which finally gives a Bethe-Salpeter equation in the diquarks-quarks channel. By identifying the baryons with the bound states, we can obtain a description of their properties. In particular, we obtain the right mass spectrum for the proton, $\Lambda$, $\Xi$, and $\Sigma$ at T=0 and $\mu=0$. We extend the formalism to finite temperature and density to obtain a description of the mass change of these baryons in the medium. "
"We consider the Shallow Water equations in the supercritical and subcritical cases in one space variable,posed in a finite spatial interval with characteristic boundary conditions at the endpoints, which, as is well known, are transparent,i.e. allow outgoing waves to exit without generating spurious reflected waves. Assuming that the resulting initial-boundary-value problems have smooth solutions,we approximate them in space using standard Galerkin-finite element methods and prove L^2 error estimates for the semidiscrete problems on quasiuniform meshes.We discretize the problems in the temporal variable using an explicit,fourth-order accurate Runge-Kutta scheme and check, by means of numerical experiment, that the resulting fully discrete schemes have excellent absorption properties. "
"Implicit and explicit density functionals for the exchange energy in finite two-dimensional systems are developed following the approach of Becke and Roussel [Phys. Rev. A 39, 3761 (1989)]. Excellent agreement for the exchange-hole potentials and exchange energies is found when compared with the exact-exchange reference data for the two-dimensional uniform electron gas and few-electron quantum dots, respectively. Thereby, this work significantly improves the availability of approximate density functionals for dealing with electrons in quasi-two-dimensional structures, which have various applications in semiconductor nanotechnology. "
"We study the breakup of a liquid jet a few nanometers in diameter, based on a stochastic differential equation derived recently by Moseler and Landman [Science {\bf 289}, 1165 (2000)]. In agreement with their simulations, we confirm that noise qualitatively changes the characteristics of breakup, leading to symmetric profiles. Using the path integral description, we find a self-similar profile that describes the most probable breakup mode. As illustrated by a simple physical argument, noise is the driving force behind pinching, speeding up the breakup to make surface tension irrelevant. "
We extend Schwartzman theory beyond dimension 1 and provide a unified treatment of Ruelle-Sullivan and Schwartzman theories via Birkhoff's ergodic theorem for the class of immersions of solenoids with a trapping region.
"One of the fundamental theorems in extremal combinatorics, the Erd\H{o}s--Ko--Rado theorem considers intersecting families of subsets of a finite set. For 1<= r<= n/2, it proves that the maximum size of an intersecting family of r-subsets of an n-element set is bounded by the size of a star family, i.e. a family of all r-subsets containing a fixed element, called the center of the star. In this note, we consider a graph-theoretic generalization of the theorem that looks at intersecting families of independent sets in graphs. In particular, we focus on a special class of trees and prove results concerning centers of maximum-sized star families in these trees. "
"The reactions that destroy 26Al in massive stars have significance in a number of astrophysical contexts. We evaluate the reaction rates of 26Al(n,p)26Mg and 26Al(n,a)23Na using cross sections obtained from the codes EMPIRE and TALYS. These have been compared to the published rates obtained from the non-smoker code and to some experimental data. We show that the results obtained from EMPIRE and TALYS are comparable to those from non-smoker. We also show how the theoretical results vary with respect to changes in the input parameters. Finally, we present recommended rates for these reactions using the available experimental data and our new theoretical results. "
"In most modern operating systems, init (as in ""initialization"") is the program launched by the kernel at boot time. It runs as a daemon and typically has PID 1. Init is responsible for spawning all other processes and scavenging zombies. It is also responsible for reboot and shutdown operations. This document describes existing solutions that implement the init process and/or init scripts in Unix-like systems. These solutions range from the legacy and still-in-use BSD and SystemV schemes, to recent and promising schemes from Ubuntu, Apple, Sun and independent developers. Our goal is to highlight their focus and compare their sets of features. "
"Let $X$ be a metric space and let $\mu$ be a probability measure on it. Consider a Lipschitz map $T: X \rightarrow \Rn$, with Lipschitz constant $\leq 1$. Then one can ask whether the image $TX$ can have large projections on many directions. For a large class of spaces $X$, we show that there are directions $\phi \in \nsphere$ on which the projection of the image $TX$ is small on the average, with bounds depending on the dimension $n$ and the eigenvalues of the Laplacian on $X$. "
"The properties of rapidly quenched superfluid phase transitions are computed for two-dimensional Kosterlitz-Thouless (KT) systems. The decay in the vortex-pair density and the recovery of the superfluid density after a quench are found by solving the Fokker-Planck equation describing the vortex dynamics, in conjunction with the KT recursion relations. The vortex density is found to decay approximately as the inverse of the time from the quench, in agreement with computer simulations and with scaling theories. "
We consider a general class of boundary terms of the open XYZ spin-1/2 chain compatible with integrability. We have obtained the general elliptic solution of $K$-matrix obeying the boundary Yang-Baxter equation using the $R$-matrix of the eight vertex model and derived the associated integrable spin-chain Hamiltonian.
"We explore the relationship between a certain ""abelian duality"" property of spaces and the propagation properties of their cohomology jump loci. To that end, we develop the analogy between abelian duality spaces and those spaces which possess what we call the ""EPY property."" The same underlying homological algebra allows us to deduce the propagation of jump loci: in the former case, characteristic varieties propagate, and in the latter, the resonance varieties. We apply the general theory to arrangements of linear and elliptic hyperplanes, as well as toric complexes, right-angled Artin groups, and Bestvina-Brady groups. Our approach brings to the fore the relevance of the Cohen-Macaulay condition in this combinatorial context. "
"Amongst O-type stars with detected magnetic fields, the fast rotator in the close binary called Plaskett's star shows a variety of unusual properties. Since strong binary interactions are believed to have occurred in this system, one may wonder about their potential role in generating magnetic fields. Stokes V spectra collected with the low-resolution FORS2 and high-resolution ESPaDOnS and Narval spectropolarimeters were therefore used to search for magnetic fields in 15 interacting or post-interaction massive binaries. No magnetic field was detected in any of them, with 0G always being within 2sigma of the derived values. For 17 out of 25 stars in the systems observed at high-resolution, the 90% upper limit on the individual dipolar fields is below the dipolar field strength of Plaskett's secondary; a similar result is found for five out of six systems observed at low resolution. If our sample is considered to form a group of stars sharing similar magnetic properties, a global statistical analysis results in a stringent upper limit of ~200G on the dipolar field strength. Moreover, the magnetic incidence rate in the full sample of interacting or post-interaction systems (our targets + Plaskett's star) is compatible with that measured from large surveys, showing that they are not significantly different from the general O-star population. These results suggest that binary interactions play no systematic role in the magnetism of such massive systems. "
"We calculate the relative conserved currents, superpotentials and conserved quantities between two homogeneous and isotropic universes. In particular we prove that their relative ""energy"" (defined as the conserved quantity associated to cosmic time coordinate translations for a comoving observer) is vanishing and so are the other conserved quantities related to a Lie subalgebra of vector fields isomorphic to the Poincar\'e algebra. These quantities are also conserved in time. We also find a relative conserved quantity for such a kind of solutions which is conserved in time though non-vanishing. This example provides at least two insights in the theory of conserved quantities in General Relativity. First, the contribution of the cosmological matter fluid to the conserved quantities is carefully studied and proved to be vanishing. Second, we explicitly show that our superpotential (that happens to coincide with the so-called KBL potential although it is generated differently) provides strong conservation laws under much weaker hypotheses than the ones usually required. In particular, the symmetry generator is not needed to be Killing (nor Killing of the background, nor asymptotically Killing), the prescription is quasi-local and it works fine in a finite region too and no matching condition on the boundary is required. "
Theory of weak localization is developed for two-dimensional holes in semiconductor heterostructures. Ballistic regime of weak localization where the backscattering occurs from few impurities is studied with account for anisotropic momentum scattering of holes. The transition from weak localization to anti-localization is demonstrated for long dephasing times. For stronger dephasing the conductivity correction is negative at all hole densities due to non-monotonous dependence of the spin relaxation time on the hole wavevector. The anomalous temperature dependent correction to the conductivity is calculated. We show that the temperature dependence of the conductivity is non-monotonous at moderate hole densities.
"The instantaneous charge state of uranium ions traveling through a fully ionized hydrogen plasma has been theoretically studied and compared with one of the first energy loss experiments in plasmas, carried out at GSI-Darmstadt by Hoffmann \textit{et al.} in the 90's. For this purpose, two different methods to estimate the instantaneous charge state of the projectile have been employed: (1) rate equations using ionization and recombination cross sections, and (2) equilibrium charge state formulas for plasmas. Also, the equilibrium charge state has been obtained using these ionization and recombination cross sections, and compared with the former equilibrium formulas. The equilibrium charge state of projectiles in plasmas is not always reached, it depends mainly on the projectile velocity and the plasma density. Therefore, a non-equilibrium or an instantaneous description of the projectile charge is necessary. The charge state of projectile ions cannot be measured, except after exiting the target, and experimental data remain very scarce. Thus, the validity of our charge state model is checked by comparing the theoretical predictions with an energy loss experiment, as the energy loss has a generally quadratic dependence on the projectile charge state. The dielectric formalism has been used to calculate the plasma stopping power including the Brandt-Kitagawa (BK) model to describe the charge distribution of the projectile. In this charge distribution, the instantaneous number of bound electrons instead of the equilibrium number has been taken into account. Comparing our theoretical predictions with experiments, it is shown the necessity of including the instantaneous charge state and the BK charge distribution for a correct energy loss estimation. The results also show that the initial charge state has a strong influence in order to estimate the energy loss of the uranium ions. "
We consider a model of cyclic time evolution for Kochubei's p-adic realization of the canonical commutation relations (CCR). Connections to Kubota-Leopoldt p-adic zeta-functions and to arithmetic quantum theories such as the Bost-Connes model are examined.
"(abridged) We study the low energy events observed by Kamiokande-II. We focus on the event 6 of 6.3 MeV and also on the other events that at 1 sigma fall below the energy threshold: events 3,4,10,12. The volume distribution is not a uniform distribution at 3 sigma, that suggests the presence of background events close or at the border of the volume used for the analysis, including the events 3,4,10. We checked the expected energy distribution assuming that the signal is due to nubar(e)p-->e+n and that the average antineutrino energy is 14 MeV. The agreement with the observations is not perfect but it is acceptable at the 11 % confidence level if we include the peak of low energy background events; otherwise, we face a 2.9 sigma problem. The expected energy distribution implies that the evidence for supernova neutrinos is at 10 sigma and that 1-3 background events are plausible. This conclusion does not change strongly when we model the time distribution of the signal taking into account the presence of an initial luminous phase of neutrino emission. This suggests however that some of the early events are due to supernova neutrinos and not to background. In summary, we formulate the hypothesis that some of the observed low energy events are due to background and that some among them belong to a peculiar phase of emission, that could be further characterized by low energy neutrinos. Such an interpretation diminishes to a minimum the postulated number of background events and thus improves the agreement between the a priori and the a posteriori expectations on the number of background events. We argue on these grounds that there is no significant disagreement between the average energy of the supernova neutrinos seen in Kamiokande-II and the conventional expectations. "
"An effective, reliable and time saving numerical method with using of the Pruefer transformation is proposed to calculate eigenvalues of Chandrasekhar-Page angular equations. "
"We experimentally demonstrate continuous-variable quantum teleportation beyond the no-cloning limit. We teleport a coherent state and achieve the fidelity of 0.70$\pm$0.02 that surpasses the no-cloning limit of 2/3. Surpassing the limit is necessary to transfer the nonclassicality of an input quantum state. By using our high-fidelity teleporter, we demonstrate entanglement swapping, namely teleportation of quantum entanglement, as an example of transfer of nonclassicality. "
"Let $X$ be a smooth projective curve of genus $g \ge 3$ and let $M_0$ be the moduli space of semistable bundles over $X$ of rank 2 with trivial determinant. Three different desingularizations of $M_0$ have been constructed by Seshadri \cite{Se1}, Narasimhan-Ramanan \cite{NR}, and Kirwan \cite{k5}. In this paper, we construct a birational morphism from Kirwan's desingularization to Narasimhan-Ramanan's, and prove that the Narasimhan-Ramanan's desingularization (called the moduli space of Hecke cycles) is the intermediate variety between Kirwan's and Seshadri's as was conjectured recently in \cite{KL}. As a by-product, we compute the cohomology of the moduli space of Hecke cycles. "
"In the previous paper, we have constructed two $f(T)$ models with nonminimal torsion-matter coupling extension, which are successful in describing the evolution history of the Universe including the radiation-dominated era, the matter-dominated era, and the present accelerating expansion. Meantime, the significant advantage of these models is that they could avoid the cosmological constant problem of $\Lambda$CDM. However, the nonminimal coupling between matter and torsion will affect the tests of Solar system. In this paper, we study the effects of Solar system in these models, including the gravitation redshift, geodetic effect and perihelion preccesion. We find that Model I can pass all three of the Solar system tests. For Model II, the parameter is constrained by the measure of the perihelion precession of Mercury. "
"Motivated by the intriguing report, in some frustrated quantum antiferromagnets, of magnetization plateaus whose simple collinear structure is {\it not} stabilized by an external magnetic field in the classical limit, we develop a semiclassical method to estimate the zero-point energy of collinear configurations even when they do not correspond to a local minimum of the classical energy. For the spin-1/2 frustrated square-lattice antiferromagnet, this approach leads to the stabilization of a large 1/2 plateau with ""up-up-up-down"" structure for J_2/J_1>1/2, in agreement with exact diagonalization results, while for the spin-1/2 anisotropic triangular antiferromagnet, it predicts that the 1/3 plateau with ""up-up-down"" structure is stable far from the isotropic point, in agreement with the properties of Cs_2CuBr_4. "
"One major goal of vision is to infer physical models of objects, surfaces, and their layout from sensors. In this paper, we aim to interpret indoor scenes from one RGBD image. Our representation encodes the layout of walls, which must conform to a Manhattan structure but is otherwise flexible, and the layout and extent of objects, modeled with CAD-like 3D shapes. We represent both the visible and occluded portions of the scene, producing a complete 3D parse. Such a scene interpretation is useful for robotics and visual reasoning, but difficult to produce due to the well-known challenge of segmentation, the high degree of occlusion, and the diversity of objects in indoor scene. We take a data-driven approach, generating sets of potential object regions, matching to regions in training images, and transferring and aligning associated 3D models while encouraging fit to observations and overall consistency. We demonstrate encouraging results on the NYU v2 dataset and highlight a variety of interesting directions for future work. "
"This paper is focused on delivering a solution that can scan and reconstruct the 3D profile of a pipeline in real-time using a crawler robot. A structured infrared (IR) laser ring projector and a stereo camera system are used to generate the 3D profile of the pipe as the robot moves inside the pipe. The proposed stereo system does not require field calibrations and it is not affected by the lateral movement of the robot, hence capable of producing an accurate 3D map. The wavelength of the IR light source is chosen to be non overlapping with the visible spectrum of the color camera. Hence RGB color values of the depth can be obtained by projecting the 3D map into the color image frame. The proposed system is implemented in Robotic Operating System (ROS) producing real-time RGB-D maps with defects. The defect map exploit differences in ovality enabling real-time identification of structural defects such as surface corrosion in pipe infrastructure. The lab experiments showed the proposed laser profiling system can detect ovality changes of the pipe with millimeter level of accuracy and resolution. "

"The article describes interesting nonlinear differential identities satisfied by standard exponential and trigonometric functions, which appeared as byproducts of medical imaging research. They look like some kind of non-commutative binomial formulas. A brief description of the origin of these identities is provided, as well as their direct algebraic derivation. Relations with separate analyticity theorems in several complex variables and some open problems are also mentioned. "
"We present an application of the Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) algorithm to state of the art deep convolutional neural networks and Fisher Vector classifiers to compare the image perception and prediction strategies of both classifiers with the use of visualized heatmaps. Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) is a method to compute scores for individual components of an input image, denoting their contribution to the prediction of the classifier for one particular test point. We demonstrate the impact of different choices of decomposition cut-off points during the LRP-process, controlling the resolution and semantics of the heatmap on test images from the PASCAL VOC 2007 test data set. "
"Lepton number charges might be the source of long range forces. If one accepts that neutrinos produced in the Sun do indeed oscillate while crossing the interior of the Sun, then the shift in the phase of the neutrino wavefunction caused by an hypothetical potential associated to the leptonic charge of the electrons in the Sun could affect the oscillation pattern beyond what is actually observed. We show that a ""fine structure"" constant $\alpha_{L}$ in excess of $6.4 \times 10^{-54}$ is incompatible with present observational data. This bound is not valid for forces whose range is shorter than the size of the Sun. "
"We study the stability of trajectories near the disk plane of galaxy models with a triaxial dark matter halo component. We also examine the effect of weak discreteness noise, rapidly rotating bar perturbations and weak dissipation on these trajectories. If the matter distribution is triaxial and has a constant density core, dissipation leads to inflow of material inside the core radius to the centre. This leads to the formation of central masses which in turn destabilise the trajectories of any stars formed in these regions. In particular, even if the gas settles by dissipation into a flat disk, stars formed in that disk will later form a bulge like dstribution the extent of which would be related to the core radius of the halo and the original asymmetry in the plane. The process of gas inflow is regulated by the fact that too large and condensed a central mass leads to the creation of stable closed loop orbits in the central area around which the gas can move. This would appear to stop the accumulation of central mass before it becomes large enough for rapid loss of halo triaxiality. It was found that weak discreteness noise can change the fraction of such trajectories significantly and can therefore have important consequences for the modelling of galaxies. The addition of rapidly rotating bar perturbations also increases the degree of instability dramatically. So if bars can form in triaxial haloes they are likely to be quickly destroyed leaving a bulge like structure behind (which may explain the absence of bars in surveys of high redshift galaxies). "
"Since the 1998 proposal to build a quantum computer using dopants in semiconductors as qubits, much progress has been achieved on semiconductors nano fabrication and control of charge and spins in single dopants. However, an important problem remains, which is the control at the atomic scale of the dopants positioning. We propose to circumvent this problem by using 2 dimensional materials as hosts. Since the first isolation of graphene in 2004, the number of new 2D materials with favorable properties for electronics has been growing. Dopants in 2 dimensional systems are more tightly bound and potentially easier to position and manipulate. Considering the properties of currently available 2D materials, we access the feasibility of such proposal in terms of the manipulability of isolated dopants (for single qubit operations) and dopant pairs (for two qubit operations). Our results indicate that a wide variety of 2D materials may perform at least as well as the currently studied bulk host for donor qubits. "

"We consider a Markov process on a Riemannian manifold, which solves a stochastic differential equation in the interior of the manifold and jumps according to a deterministic reset map when it reaches the boundary. We derive a partial differential equation for the probability density function, involving a non-local boundary condition which accounts for the jumping behaviour of the process. This is a generalisation of the usual Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov equation for diffusion processes. The result is illustrated with an example in the field of stochastic hybrid systems. "
"We prove that the multiplier algebra of the Drury-Arveson Hardy space $H_{n}^{2}$ on the unit ball in $\mathbb{C}^{n}$ has no corona in its maximal ideal space, thus generalizing the famous Corona Theorem of L. Carleson to higher dimensions. This result is obtained as a corollary of the Toeplitz corona theorem and a new Banach space result: the Besov-Sobolev space $B_{p}^{\sigma}$ has the ""baby corona property"" for all $\sigma \geq 0$ and $1<p<\infty $. In addition we obtain infinite generator and semi-infinite matrix versions of these theorems. "
"A graph coloring has bounded clustering if each monochromatic component has bounded size. This paper studies clustered coloring, where the number of colors depends on an excluded complete bipartite subgraph. This is a much weaker assumption than previous works, where typically the number of colors depends on an excluded minor. This paper focuses on graph classes with bounded layered treewidth, which include planar graphs, graphs of bounded Euler genus, graphs embeddable on a fixed surface with a bounded number of crossings per edge, amongst other examples. Our main theorem says that for fixed integers $s,t,k$, every graph with layered treewidth at most $k$ and with no $K_{s,t}$ subgraph is $(s+2)$-colorable with bounded clustering. In the $s=1$ case, which corresponds to graphs of bounded maximum degree, we obtain polynomial bounds on the clustering. This greatly improves a corresponding result of Esperet and Joret for graphs of bounded genus. The $s=3$ case implies that every graph with a drawing on a fixed surface with a bounded number of crossings per edge is 5-colorable with bounded clustering. Our main theorem is also a critical component in two companion papers that study clustered coloring of graphs with no $K_{s,t}$-subgraph and excluding a fixed minor, odd minor or topological minor. "
"Systems of exchange-coupled spins are commonly used to model ferromagnets. The quantum correlations in such magnets are studied using tools from quantum information theory. Isotropic ferromagnets are shown to possess a universal low-temperature density matrix which precludes entanglement between spins, and the mechanism of entanglement cancellation is investigated, revealing a core of states resistant to pairwise entanglement cancellation. Numerical studies of one-, two-, and three-dimensional lattices as well as irregular geometries showed no entanglement in ferromagnets at any temperature or magnetic field strength. "
"MMS (Multimedia Messaging Service) is the next generation of messaging services in multimedia mobile communications. MMS enables messaging with full multimedia content including images, audios, videos, texts and data, from client to client or e-mail. MMS is based on WAP technology, so it is technology independent. This means that enabling messages from a GSM/GPRS network to be sent to a TDMA or WCDMA network. In this paper a methodology for implementing MMS client on embedded platforms especially on Wince OS is described. "
"SentiWordNet is an important lexical resource supporting sentiment analysis in opinion mining applications. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to construct a Vietnamese SentiWordNet (VSWN). SentiWordNet is typically generated from WordNet in which each synset has numerical scores to indicate its opinion polarities. Many previous studies obtained these scores by applying a machine learning method to WordNet. However, Vietnamese WordNet is not available unfortunately by the time of this paper. Therefore, we propose a method to construct VSWN from a Vietnamese dictionary, not from WordNet. We show the effectiveness of the proposed method by generating a VSWN with 39,561 synsets automatically. The method is experimentally tested with 266 synsets with aspect of positivity and negativity. It attains a competitive result compared with English SentiWordNet that is 0.066 and 0.052 differences for positivity and negativity sets respectively. "
"We investigate trilepton final states to probe top anomalous couplings at the Large Hadron Collider. We focus on events originating from the associated production of a single top quark with a Z-boson, a channel sensitive to several flavor-changing neutral interactions of top and up/charm quarks. In particular, we explore a way to access simultaneously their anomalous couplings to Z-bosons and gluons and derive the discovery potential of trilepton final states to such interactions with 20 fb-1 of 8 TeV collisions. We show that effective coupling strengths of O(0.1-1) TeV-1 can be reached. Equivalently, branching fractions of top quarks into lighter quarks and gluons or Z-bosons can be constrained to be below O(0.1-1)%. "
This research announcement discusses our results on Gromov-Witten theory of root gerbes. A complete calculation of genus 0 Gromov-Witten theory of $\mu_{r}$-root gerbes over a smooth base scheme is obtained by a direct analysis of virtual fundamental classes. Our result verifies the genus 0 part of the so-called decomposition conjecture which compares Gromov-Witten theory of \'etale gerbes with that of the bases. We also verify this conjecture in all genera for toric gerbes over toric Deligne-Mumford stacks.
"In the context of the Higgs model involving gauge and Yukawa interactions with the spontaneous gauge symmetry breaking, we consider $\lambda \phi^4$ inflation with non-minimal gravitational coupling, where the Higgs field is identified as inflaton. Since the inflaton quartic coupling is very small, once quantum corrections through the gauge and Yukawa interactions are taken into account, the inflaton effective potential most likely becomes unstable. In order to avoid this problem, we need to impose stability conditions on the effective inflaton potential, which lead to not only non-trivial relations amongst the particle mass spectrum of the model, but also correlations between the inflationary predictions and the mass spectrum. For concrete discussion, we investigate the minimal $B-L$ extension of the Standard Model with identification of the $B-L$ Higgs field as inflaton. The stability conditions for the inflaton effective potential fix the mass ratio amongst the $B-L$ gauge boson, the right-handed neutrinos and the inflaton. This mass ratio also correlates with the inflationary predictions. In other words, if the $B-L$ gauge boson and the right-handed neutrinos are discovered in future, their observed mass ratio provides constraints on the inflationary predictions. "
We introduce a simplified version of the Grothendieck group of algebraic varieties and use it to show that birational types specialize in families with mild singularities of the central fiber.
"Vibrationally resolved spectra provide a stringent test of the accuracy of theoretical calculations. We combine the thawed Gaussian approximation (TGA) with an on-the-fly ab initio (OTF-AI) scheme to calculate the vibrationally resolved emission spectra of oligothiophenes with up to five rings. The efficiency of the OTF-AI-TGA permits treating all vibrational degrees of freedom on an equal footing even in pentathiophene with 105 vibrational degrees of freedom, thus obviating the need for the global harmonic approximation, popular for large systems. Besides reproducing almost perfectly the experimental emission spectra, in order to provide a deeper insight into the associated physical and chemical processes, we also develop a novel systematic approach to assess the importance and coupling between individual vibrational degrees of freedom during the dynamics. This allows us to explain how the vibrational line shapes of the oligothiophenes change with increasing number of rings. Furthermore, we observe the dynamical interplay between the quinoid and aromatic characters of individual rings in the oligothiophene chain during the dynamics and confirm that the quinoid character prevails in the center of the chain. "
"We prove that multimodal maps with an absolutely continuous invariant measure have exponential return time statistics around a.e. point. We also show a `polynomial Gibbs property' for these systems, and that the convergence to the entropy in the Ornstein-Weiss formula has normal fluctuations. These results are also proved for equilibrium states of some Hoelder potentials. "
"Let $(X,0)$ be an isolated hypersurface singularity defined by $\phi\colon(\mathbb C^n,0)\to(\mathbb C,0)$ and $f\colon(\mathbb C^n,0)\to\mathbb C$ such that the Bruce-Roberts number $\mu_{BR}(f,X)$ is finite. We first prove that $\mu_{BR}(f,X)=\mu(f)+\mu(\phi,f)+\mu(X,0)-\tau(X,0)$, where $\mu$ and $\tau$ are the Milnor and Tjurina numbers respectively of a function or an isolated complete intersection singularity. Second, we show that the logarithmic characteristic variety $LC(X,0)$ is Cohen-Macaulay. Both theorems generalize the results of a previous paper by some of the authors, in which the hypersurface $(X,0)$ was assumed to be weighted homogeneous. "
"Ambient energy harvesting has been in recent years the recurring object of a number of research efforts aimed at providing an autonomous solution to the powering of small-scale electronic mobile devices. Among the different solutions, vibration energy harvesting has played a major role due to the almost universal presence of mechanical vibrations: from ground shaking to human movements, from ambient sound to thermal noise. Standard approaches are mainly based on resonant linear oscillators that are acted on by ambient vibrations. Here we propose a new method based on the exploitation of the dynamical features of stochastic nonlinear oscillators. Such a method is shown to outperform standard linear oscillators and to overcome some of the most severe limitations of present approaches, like narrow bandwidth, need for continuous frequency tuning and low efficiency. We demonstrate the superior performances of this method by applying it to piezoelectric energy harvesting from ambient vibration. Experimental results from a toy-model oscillator are described in terms of nonlinear stochastic dynamics. We prove that the method proposed here is quite general in principle and could be applied to a wide class of nonlinear oscillators and different energy conversion principles. There are also potentials for realizing micro/nano-scale power generators. "
We consider an example of a quantum algorithm from the point of view of the de Broglie-Bohm formulation of quantum mechanics. For concreteness we look at two particular implementations: one using spin-1/2 particles as described by a simple model due to Bell and the other as energy states in an infinite-well potential. We extend the analysis to encompass a complete set of quantum gates. We conclude by discussing the relevance of our investigations for the debate about the origin of the quantum-computational speed-up.
"Recent X-ray observations by Fermi/GBM discovered a new torque reversal of 4U 1626-67 after 18 years of steady spinning down. Using Swift/BAT observations we were able to center this new torque reversal on Feb 4 2008, lasting approximately 150 days. From 2004 up to the end of 2007, the spin-down rate averaged at a mean rate of ~dnu/dt=-4.8e-13 Hz s-1 until the torque reversal reported here. Since then it has been following a steady spin-up at a mean rate of ~dnu/dt= 4e-13 Hz s-1. The properties of this torque reversal, as well as the lack of correlation between the X-ray flux and the torque applied to the neutron star before this transition, challenges our understanding of the physical mechanisms operating in this system. "
"A new study is reported of a lattice QCD calculation of the $K^+\to\pi^+ \pi^0 $ decay amplitude with the Wilson quark action in the quenched approximation at $\beta=6.1$. The amplitude is extracted from the $K\to\pi\pi$ Green function, and a conversion to the continuum value is made employing a recent one-loop calculation of chiral perturbation theory. The result is consistent with the experimental value if extrapolated to the chiral limit. "
"HD 209458 is one of the benchmark objects in the study of hot Jupiter atmospheres and their evaporation through planetary winds. The expansion of the planetary atmosphere is thought to be driven by high-energy EUV and X-ray irradiation. We obtained new Chandra HRC-I data, which unequivocally show that HD 209458 is an X-ray source. Combining these data with archival XMM-Newton observations, we find that the corona of HD 209458 is characterized by a temperature of about 1 MK and an emission measure of 7e49 cm^-3, yielding an X-ray luminosity of 1.6e27 erg/s in the 0.124-2.48 keV band. HD 209458 is an inactive star with a coronal temperature comparable to that of the inactive Sun but a larger emission measure. At this level of activity, the planetary high-energy emission is sufficient to support mass-loss at a rate of a few times 1e10 g/s. "
"We report the local measurements of the magnetic penetration depth $\lambda$ in a superconducting Nb film using magnetic force microscopy (MFM). We developed a method for quantitative extraction of the penetration depth from single-parameter simultaneous fits to the lateral and height profiles of the MFM signal, and demonstrate that the obtained value is in excellent agreement with that obtained from the bulk magnetization measurements. "
"Extending It\^o's formula to non-smooth functions is important both in theory and applications. One of the fairly general extensions of the formula, known as Meyer-It\^o, applies to one dimensional semimartingales and convex functions. There are also satisfactory generalizations of It\^o's formula for diffusion processes where the Meyer-It\^o assumptions are weakened even further. We study a version of It\^o's formula for multi-dimensional finite variation L\'evy processes assuming that the underlying function is continuous and admits weak derivatives. We also discuss some applications of this extension, particularly in finance. "
"Twitter, a popular social network, presents great opportunities for on-line machine learning research. However, previous research has focused almost entirely on learning from passively collected data. We study the problem of learning to acquire followers through normative user behavior, as opposed to the mass following policies applied by many bots. We formalize the problem as a contextual bandit problem, in which we consider retweeting content to be the action chosen and each tweet (content) is accompanied by context. We design reward signals based on the change in followers. The result of our month long experiment with 60 agents suggests that (1) aggregating experience across agents can adversely impact prediction accuracy and (2) the Twitter community's response to different actions is non-stationary. Our findings suggest that actively learning on-line can provide deeper insights about how to attract followers than machine learning over passively collected data alone. "
"In minimal SUSY-GUT models with $M_{SUSY}\ltap 1$ TeV, the renormalization group equations have a solution dominated by the infrared fixed point of the top Yukawa coupling. This fixed point predicts $m_t=(200\; {\rm GeV})\sin \beta $; combined with the LEP results it excludes $m_t\ltap 130$ GeV. For $m_t$ in the range 130-160 GeV, we discuss the sensitivity of the $m_t$ fixed point result to GUT threshold corrections and point out the implications for Higgs boson searches. The lightest scalar $h$ has mass 60-85 GeV and will be detectable at LEPII. At SSC/LHC, each of the five scalars $h$, $H$, $A$, $H^{\pm }$ may be detectable, but not all of them together; in one parameter region none will be detectable. "
"We describe a double-peak structure of the coincidence spectrum of biphoton states in the process of spontaneous parametric down-conversion with a pump having the form of short pulses. The effect is shown to arise owing to the obligatory symmetry of bihoton wave functions, as wave functions describing states of two bozons obeying the Bose-Einstein statistics. Parameters of the peaks are found and conditions necessary for experimental observation of the effect are determined. "
This paper focuses on the characteristics of two big triggers that facilitated wide user adoption of the Internet: Web 2.0 and online social networks. We detect brakes for reproduction of these events in Internet of things. To support our hypothesis we first compare the difference between the ways of use of the Internet with the future scenarios of Internet of things. We detect barriers that could slow down apparition of this kind of social events during user adoption of Internet of Things and we propose a conceptual framework to solve these problems.
"In this work we consider the topological analysis of symbolic formal systems in the framework of network theory. In particular we analyse the network extracted by Principia Mathematica of B. Russell and A.N. Whitehead, where the vertices are the statements and two statements are connected with a directed link if one statement is used to demonstrate the other one. We compare the obtained network with other directed acyclic graphs, such as a scientific citation network and a stochastic model. We also introduce a novel topological ordering for directed acyclic graphs and we discuss its properties in respect to the classical one. The main result is the observation that formal systems of knowledge topologically behave similarly to self-organised systems. "
"We present a new release of the program iHixs. This easy-to-use tool allows to derive state of the art predictions for the inclusive production cross section of a Higgs boson at hadron colliders in the gluon fusion production mode. This includes the most up-to-date corrections in perturbative QCD and electro-weak theory, effects due to finite quark masses as well as an option to perform threshold resummation. In particular, exact perturbative QCD corrections through N3LO are included in the heavy top quark effective theory. Furthermore, iHixs contains automatic routines that allow to assess residual uncertainties on the prediction for the Higgs boson production cross section according to well established standard definitions. iHixs can be obtained from https://github.com/dulatf/ihixs .

"Human activity recognition aims to recognize the activities of daily living by utilizing the sensors on different body parts. However, when the labeled data from a certain body position (i.e. target domain) is missing, how to leverage the data from other positions (i.e. source domain) to help learn the activity labels of this position? When there are several source domains available, it is often difficult to select the most similar source domain to the target domain. With the selected source domain, we need to perform accurate knowledge transfer between domains. Existing methods only learn the global distance between domains while ignoring the local property. In this paper, we propose a \textit{Stratified Transfer Learning} (STL) framework to perform both source domain selection and knowledge transfer. STL is based on our proposed \textit{Stratified} distance to capture the local property of domains. STL consists of two components: Stratified Domain Selection (STL-SDS) can select the most similar source domain to the target domain; Stratified Activity Transfer (STL-SAT) is able to perform accurate knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on three public activity recognition datasets demonstrate the superiority of STL. Furthermore, we extensively investigate the performance of transfer learning across different degrees of similarities and activity levels between domains. We also discuss the potential applications of STL in other fields of pervasive computing for future research. "
"It is demonstrated that recent results on 1d granular gas in a container with a vibrating piston, which was modelled by a shock wave propagation, can be understood with a modelling using ideas coming from the ""thermodynamics of a single particle"". Defining e as the square root of the energetic-restitution coefficient of a single collision, and N as the total number of grains, the mean loss during a round trip of the momentum is calculated in the limit N(1-e)<<1. It is also demonstrated that the system cannot propagate sound waves nor shock waves in the limit of N(1-e)<<1 and that hydrodynamics equations cannot be defined when N(1-e)<<1.

"Strange hadrons, especially multi-strange hadrons are good probes for the early partonic stage of heavy ion collisions due to their small hadronic cross sections. In this paper, I give a brief review on the elliptic flow measurements of strange and multi-strange hadrons in relativistic heavy ion collisions at Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider (RHIC) and Large Hadron Collider (LHC).

"Artin-Tits groups act on a certain delta-hyperbolic complex, called the ""additional length complex"". For an element of the group, acting loxodromically on this complex is a property analogous to the property of being pseudo-Anosov for elements of mapping class groups. By analogy with a well-known conjecture about mapping class groups, we conjecture that ""most"" elements of Artin-Tits groups act loxodromically. More precisely, in the Cayley graph of a subgroup $G$ of an Artin-Tits group, the proportion of loxodromically acting elements in a ball of large radius should tend to one as the radius tends to infinity. In this paper, we give a condition guaranteeing that this proportion stays away from zero. This condition is satisfied e.g. for Artin-Tits groups of spherical type, their pure subgroups and some of their commutator subgroups. "
"We present an idea for creation of a crystalline undulator and report its first realization. One face of a silicon crystal was given periodic micro-scratches (trenches) by means of a diamond blade. The X-ray tests of the crystal deformation due to given periodic pattern of surface scratches have shown that a sinusoidal shape is observed on both the scratched surface and the opposite (unscratched) face of the crystal, that is, a periodic sinusoidal deformation goes through the bulk of the crystal. This opens up the possibility for experiments with high-energy particles channeled in crystalline undulator, a novel compact source of radiation. "
We report calculations of B_K using two flavours of dynamical clover-improved Wilson lattice fermions and look for dependence on the dynamical quark mass at fixed lattice spacing. We see some evidence for dynamical quark effects. In particular B_K decreases as the sea quark masses are reduced towards the up/down quark mass. Our meson masses are quite heavy and a firm prediction of B_K is a task for future simulations.
"We include the $\eta_c$ meson into the $\eta$-$\eta'$-$G$ mixing formalism constructed in our previous work, where $G$ represents the pseudoscalar gluball. The mixing angles in this tetramixing matrix are constrained by theoretical and experimental implications from relevant hadronic processes. Especially, the angle between $\eta_c$ and $G$ is found to be about $11^\circ$ from the measured decay widths of the $\eta_c$ meson. The pseudoscalar glueball mass $m_G$, the pseudoscalar densities $m_{qq,ss,cc}$ and the U(1) anomaly matrix elements associated with the mixed states are solved from the anomalous Ward identities. The solution $m_G\approx 1.4$ GeV obtained from the $\eta$-$\eta'$-$G$ mixing is confirmed, while $m_{qq}$ grows to above the pion mass, and thus increases perturbative QCD predictions for the branching ratios $Br(B\to\eta'K)$. We then analyze the $\eta_c$-mixing effects on charmonium magnetic dipole transitions, and on the $B\to\eta^{(\prime)}K_S$ branching ratios and CP asymmetries, which further improve the consistency between theoretical predictions and data. A predominant observation is that the $\eta_c$ mixing enhances the perturbative QCD predictions for $Br(B\to\eta'K)$ by 18%, but does not alter those for $Br(B\to\eta K)$. The puzzle due to the large $Br(B\to\eta'K)$ data is then resolved. "
"We characterise $L_p$-norms on the space of integrable step functions, defined on a probabilistic space, via H\""older's type inequality with an optimality condition. "
"We consider the problem of numerically evaluating the expected value of a smooth bounded function of a chi-distributed random variable, divided by the square root of the number of degrees of freedom. This problem arises in the contexts of simultaneous inference, the selection and ranking of populations and in the evaluation of multivariate t probabilities. It also arises in the assessment of the coverage probability and expected volume properties of the non-standard confidence regions considered Kabaila and co-authors. We propose the application of the ""Mixed Rule"" transformation, followed by the application of the trapezoidal rule. This rule has the remarkable property that, for suitable integrands, it is exponentially convergent. We use it to create a nested sequence of quadrature rules, for the estimation of the approximation error, so that previous evaluations of the integrand are not wasted. The application of the trapezoidal rule requires the approximation of an infinite sum by a finite sum. We provide a new easily computed upper bound on the error of this approximation. Our overall conclusion is that this method is very suitable for the assessment of the coverage and expected volume properties of non-standard confidence regions. "
"In this paper, we establish the uniqueness of heat flow of harmonic maps into (N, h) that have sufficiently small renormalized energies, provided that N is either a unit sphere $S^{k-1}$ or a compact Riemannian homogeneous manifold without boundary. For such a class of solutions, we also establish the convexity property of the Dirichlet energy for $t\ge t_0>0$ and the unique limit property at time infinity. As a corollary, the uniqueness is shown for heat flow of harmonic maps into any compact Riemannian manifold N without boundary whose gradients belong to $L^q_t L^l_x$ for $q>2$ and $l>n$ satisfying the Serrin's condition.

"Dynamical structure factor (S(k,$\omega$)) is calculated for the one-dimensional (1D) transverse field Ising model, and its recent extension to include a three spin term, with quenched binary disorder. We study the low energy modes for lattices as large as 256 sites. We show that the intense zero energy modes appear whenever the binary disorder straddles two different winding numbers. We argue that these are Majorana modes, which reside on the boundaries of the rare regions. The size distribution of Majorana pairs has a fractal behavior at the critical points. With the longer ranged interactions a spin glass transition is observed as well. "
"In this paper a model of subscriber telephone network based on the concept of cellular automata is elaborated. Some fractal properties inherent in the model are revealed that vary depending on parameters assigning its operation rules. The main advantage of the model in question is its compatibility with algorithmic methods - a finite set of formal rules, assigned on a finite set of elements (cells), allows precise realization in the form of algorithms.

"We study the Euclidean supersymmetric D=11 M-algebras. We consider two such D=11 superalgebras: the first one is N=(1,1) self-conjugate complex-Hermitean, with 32 complex supercharges and 1024 real bosonic charges, the second is N=(1,0) complex-holomorphic, with 32 complex supercharges and 528 bosonic charges, which can be obtained by analytic continuation of known Minkowski M-algebra. Due to the Bott's periodicity, we study at first the generic D=3 Euclidean supersymmetry case. The role of complex and quaternionic structures for D=3 and D=11 Euclidean supersymmetry is elucidated. We show that the additional 1024-528=496 Euclidean tensorial central charges are related with the quaternionic structure of Euclidean D=11 supercharges, which in complex notation satisfy SU(2) pseudo-Majorana condition. We consider also the corresponding Osterwalder-Schrader conjugations as implying for N=(1,0) case the reality of Euclidean bosonic charges. Finally, we outline some consequences of our results, in particular for D=11 Euclidean supergravity. "
"The Chiral Quark-Soliton Model of nucleons is based on two ideas: 1) the major role of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in hadron physics and 2) the relevance of the large number of colours limit for the real world.

"The synthesis and crystallographic, thermodynamic and transport properties of single crystalline Rh$_{9}$In$_4$S$_4$ were studied. The resistivity, magnetization and specific heat measurements all clearly indicate bulk superconductivity with a critical temperature, $T_{c}\sim$ 2.25 K. The Sommerfeld coefficient $\gamma$ and the Debye temperature($\varTheta_{\textrm{D}}$) were found to be 34 mJ mol$^{-1}$ K$^{-2}$ and 217 K respectively. The observed specific heat jump, $\Delta C/\gamma T_{c}$ = 1.66, is larger than the expected BCS weak coupling value of 1.43. Ginzburg-Landau (GL) ratio of the low temperature GL-penetration depth, $\lambda_\text{GL}$$\approx$ 5750\AA, to the GL-coherence length, $\xi_\text{GL}$$\approx$ 94\AA, is large: $\kappa$ $\sim$ 60. Furthermore, we observed a peak effect in the resistivity measurement as a function of both temperature and magnetic field. "
"Using a large quantity of Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer data presented in the literature I offer a detailed investigation into the accuracy of quasiperiodic oscillations (QPO) frequency determination. The QPO phenomenon seen in X-ray binaries is possibly a result of the resonance of the intrinsic (eigen) oscillations and harmonic driving forces of the system. I show that the resonances, in the presence of the damping of oscillations, occur at the frequencies which are systematically and randomly shifted with respect to the eigenfrequencies of the system. The shift value strongly depends on the damping rate which is measured by the halfwidth of the QPO feature. Taking into account this effect I analyze the QPO data for four Z-sources: Sco X-1, GX 340+0, GX 5-1, GX 17+2 and two atoll sources: 4U 1728-34, 4U 0614+09. The transition layer model (TLM) predicts the existence of the invariant quantity: delta, an inclination angle of the magnetospheric axis with respect to the normal to the disk. I calculate delta and the error bars of delta using the resonance shift and I find that the inferred delta-values are consistent with constants for these four Z-sources, where horizontal branch oscillation and kilohertz frequencies have been detected and correctly identified. It is shown that the inferred delta are in the range between 5.5 and 6.5 degrees. I conclude that the TLM seems to be compatible with data. "
"The propagation of cosmological ionization fronts during the reionization of the universe is strongly influenced by small-scale gas inhomogeneities due to structure formation. These inhomogeneities include both collapsed minihalos, which are generally self-shielding, and lower-density structures, which are not. The minihalos are dense and sufficiently optically-thick to trap intergalactic ionization fronts, blocking their path and robbing them of ionizing photons until the minihalo gas is expelled as an evaporative wind. The lower-density structures do not trap these fronts, but they can slow them down by increasing the overall recombination rate in the intergalactic medium. In this paper we study the effects of both types of inhomogeneities, including nonlinear clustering effects, and we find that both IGM clumping and collapsed minihalos have significant yet qualitatively different impacts on reionization. While the number density of minihalos on average increases strongly with time, the density of minihalos inside H II regions around ionizing sources is largely constant. Thus the impact of minihalos is essentially to decrease the number of ionizing photons available to the IGM at all epochs, which is equivalent to a reduction in the luminosity of each source. On the other hand, the effect of IGM clumping increases strongly with time, slowing down reionization and extending it. Thus while the impact of minihalos is largely degenerate with the unknown source efficiency, IGM clumping can help significantly in reconciling the recent observations of cosmic microwave background polarization with quasar absorption spectra at z~6, which together point to an early but extended reionization epoch.

"The HARPS spectrograph is showing an extreme stability close to the m s-1 level over more than ten years of data. However the radial velocities of some stars are contaminated by a spurious one-year signal with an amplitude that can be as high as a few m s-1 . This signal is in opposition of phase with the revolution of Earth around the Sun, and can be explained by the deformation of spectral lines crossing block stitchings of the CCD when the spectrum of an observed star is alternatively blue- and red-shifted due to the motion of Earth around the Sun. This annual perturbation can be supress by either removing those affected spectral lines from the correlation mask used by the cross correlation technique to derive precise radial velocities, or by simply fitting a yearly sinusoid to the RV data. This is mandatory if we want to detect long-period low-amplitude signals in the HARPS radial velocities of quiet solar-type stars. "
"We derive various interesting properties of complex equiangular cyclic frames for many pairs (n, k) using Gauss sums and number theory. We further use these results to study the random and burst errors of some special cases of complex equiangular cyclic (n, k) frames. "
"In this work we study solutions of the prescribed mean curvature equation over a general domain that do not necessarily attain the given boundary data. To such a solution, we can naturally associate a current with support in the closed cylinder above the domain and with boundary given by the prescribed boundary data and which inherits a natural minimizing property. Our main result is that its support is a $C^{1,\alpha}$ manifold-with-boundary, with boundary equal to the prescribed boundary data, provided that both the initial domain and the prescribed boundary data are of class $C^{1,\alpha}$.

"METIS will be among the first generation of scientific instruments on the E-ELT. Focusing on highest angular resolution and high spectral resolution, METIS will provide diffraction limited imaging and coronagraphy from 3-14um over an 20""x20"" field of view, as well as integral field spectroscopy at R ~ 100,000 from 2.9-5.3um. In addition, METIS provides medium-resolution (R ~ 5000) long slit spectroscopy, and polarimetric measurements at N band. While the baseline concept has already been discussed, this paper focuses on the significant developments over the past two years in several areas: The science case has been updated to account for recent progress in the main science areas circum-stellar disks and the formation of planets, exoplanet detection and characterization, Solar system formation, massive stars and clusters, and star formation in external galaxies. We discuss the developments in the adaptive optics (AO) concept for METIS, the telescope interface, and the instrument modelling. Last but not least, we provide an overview of our technology development programs, which ranges from coronagraphic masks, immersed gratings, and cryogenic beam chopper to novel approaches to mirror polishing, background calibration and cryo-cooling. These developments have further enhanced the design and technology readiness of METIS to reliably serve as an early discovery machine on the E-ELT. "
"Collinear limit usually provides strong constraints for scattering amplitudes. At strong coupling, collinear limit of the amplitudes in N=4 SYM is related to the large mass limit of the corresponding Y system. In this paper, we consider a special case in which all mass parameters are taken to be large, which corresponds to a multi-double-collinear limit in which a n-side polygon becomes pentagons. This limit provides a useful constraint for amplitudes, in particular, can be used to fix the periods part for the case of 4K gluons, which is the last missing piece of full amplitudes. "
"While all bipartite pure entangled states violate some Bell inequality, the relationship between entanglement and non-locality for mixed quantum states is not well understood. We introduce a simple and efficient algorithmic approach for the problem of constructing local hidden variable theories for quantum states. The method is based on constructing a so-called symmetric quasi-extension of the quantum state that gives rise to a local hidden variable model with a certain number of settings for the observers Alice and Bob. "
"We present simple new examples of pure-jump strict local martingales. The examples are constructed as exponentials of self-exciting affine Markov processes. We characterize the strict local martingale property of these processes by an integral criterion and by non-uniqueness of an associated ordinary differential equation. Finally we show an alternative construction for our examples by an absolutely continuous measure change in the spirit of (Delbaen and Schachermayer, PTRF 1995). "
"We investigate spin effects in four-quark systems consisting of two heavy anti-bottom quarks and two light up/down quarks. To this end we use the Born-Oppenheimer approximation. We utilize potentials of two static antiquarks in the presence of two quarks of finite mass computed via lattice QCD and solve a coupled-channel Schr\""odinger equation for the anti-bottom-anti-bottom separation. Without taking heavy quark spins into account this approach predicted a $u d \bar b \bar b$ tetraquark bound state with quantum numbers $I(J^P) = 0(1^+)$. We now extend this Born-Oppenheimer approach with coupled channel Schr\""odinger equations allowing us to incorporate effects due to the heavy $\bar b$ spins. We confirm the existence of the $u d \bar b \bar b$ tetraquark. "
"We report magnetic measurements up to 1200 K on multi-walled carbon nanotube mats using Quantum Design vibrating sample magnetometer. Extensive magnetic data consistently show two ferrromagnetic-like transitions at about 1000 K and 1275 K, respectively. The lower transition at about 1000 K is associated with an Fe impurity phase and its saturation magnetization is in quantitative agreement with the Fe concentration measured by an inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometer. On the other hand, the saturation magnetization for the higher transition phase ($\geq$1.0 emu/g) is about four orders of magnitude larger than that expected from the measured concentration of Co or CoFe, which has a high enough Curie temperature to explain this high transition. We show that this transition at about 1275 K is not consistent with a magnetic proximity effect of Fe-carbon systems and ferromagnetism of any carbon-based materials or magnetic impurities but with the paramagnetic Meissner effect due to the existence of $\pi$ Josephson junctions in a granular superconductor. "
"Information-Centric Networking (ICN) has emerged as an interesting approach to overcome many of the limitations of legacy IP-based networks. However, the drastic changes to legacy infrastructure required to realise an ICN have significantly hindered its adoption by network operators. As a result, alternative deployment strategies are investigated, with Software-Defined Networking (SDN) arising as a solution compatible with legacy infrastructure, thus opening new possibilities for integrating ICN concepts in operators' networks. This paper discusses the seamless integration of these two architectural paradigms and suggests a scalable and dynamic network topology bootstrapping and management framework to deploy and operate ICN topologies over SDN-enabled operator networks. We describe the designed protocol and supporting mechanisms, as well as the minimum required implementation to realize this inter-operability. A proof-of-concept prototype has been implemented to validate the feasibility of the approach. Results show that topology bootstrapping time is not significantly affected by the topology size, substantially facilitating the intelligent management of an ICN-enabled network. "
"The off-diagonal part of the active-neutrino mass matrix is constructed from two $3\times 3$ matrices playing the role of annihilation and creation matrices acting in the neutrino-generation space of $\nu_e, \nu_\mu, \nu_\tau$. The construction leads to a new relation, $M_{\mu \tau} = 4\sqrt{3} M_{e \mu} $, which predicts in the case of tribimaximal neutrino mixing that $m_3 - m_1 = \eta (m_2 - m_1)$ with $\eta = 5.28547$. Then, the maximal possible value of ${\Delta m^2_{32}}/{\Delta m^2_{21}}$ is equal to $\eta^2 -1 = 26.9362$ and gives $m_1 = 0$. With the experimental estimate ${\Delta m^2_{21}}\sim 8.0\times 10^{-5} {\rm eV}^2$, this maximal value, if realized, predicts $\Delta m^2_{32} \sim 2.2\times 10^{-3} {\rm eV}^2$, near to the popular experimental estimation $\Delta m^2_{32} \sim 2.4\times 10^{-3} {\rm eV}^2$. "
"The recent AvERA cosmological simulation of R\'acz et al. (2017) has a $\Lambda \mathrm{CDM}$-like expansion history and removes the tension between local and Planck (cosmic microwave background) Hubble constants. We contrast the AvERA prediction of the integrated Sachs--Wolfe (ISW) effect with that of $\Lambda \mathrm{CDM}$. The linear ISW effect is proportional to the derivative of the growth function, thus it is sensitive to small differences in the expansion histories of the respective models. We create simulated ISW maps tracing the path of light-rays through the Millennium XXL cosmological simulation, and perform theoretical calculations of the ISW power spectrum. AvERA predicts a significantly higher ISW effect than $\Lambda \mathrm{CDM}$, $A=1.93-5.29$ times larger depending on the $l$ index of the spherical power spectrum, which could be utilized to definitively differentiate the models. We also show that AvERA predicts an opposite-sign ISW effect in the redshift range $z \approx 1.5 - 4.4$, in clear contrast with $\Lambda \mathrm{CDM}$. Finally, we compare our ISW predictions with previous observations. While at present these cannot distinguish between the two models due to large error bars, and lack of internal consistency suggesting systematics, ISW probes from future surveys will tightly constrain the models. "
"The nature of ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) is still debated. Recent studies show that metal-poor massive stars can collapse into massive stellar black holes (MSBHs), that is black holes with mass > 25 Msun. Such MSBHs are sufficiently massive to explain most ULXs without requiring substantial violations of the Eddington limit. The recent finding of an anti-correlation between metallicity of the environment and number of ULXs per galaxy supports this hypothesis. We present the results of recent N-body simulations, including metallicity dependent stellar evolution, and we discuss the main pathways to produce X-ray binaries powered by MSBHs. "
"We compute the large-$m_t$ contributions to the $Zb\overline b$ vertex in the Standard Model non-perturbatively using both the $1/\nc$ and the $1/\nf$ expansions. Triviality and its consequences for the perturbative result are systematically analyzed. In particular, we point out that the effect of triviality is already important at the two-loop level for a heavy Higgs ($600\gev<M_H<1\tev$) even when the top mass is below $200\gev$. "
"In this work we introduce a new method to perform the identification of groups of galaxies and present results of the identification of galaxy groups in the Seventh Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS-DR7). Our methodology follows an approach that resembles the standard friends-of-friends (FoF) method. However, it uses assumptions on the mass of the dark matter halo hosting a group of galaxies to link galaxies in the group using a local linking length. Our method does not assumes any ad-hoc parameter for the identification of groups, nor a linking length or a density threshold. This parameter-free nature of the method, and the robustness of its results, are the most important points of our work. We describe the data used for our study and give details of the implementation of the method. We obtain galaxy groups and halo catalogs for four volume limited samples whose properties are in good agreement with previous works. They reproduces the expected stellar mass functions and follow the expected stellar-halo mass relation. We found that most of the stellar content in groups of galaxies comes from objects with $M_r$ absolute magnitudes larger than -19, meaning that it is important to resolve the low luminosity components of groups of galaxies to acquire detailed information about their properties. "
"The detection of the flavour content of jets produced from R-parity violating neutralino decays is investigated in the case where one baryon-number violating coupling dominates. Simulations are performed of the ATLAS experiment at the LHC for all couplings, other than lambda""_tjk since neutralino decays through these couplings are very suppressed. Secondary vertex distributions and muons produced by heavy-quark (b- and c-) jets allow discrimination between LSP decay modes. The dominant coupling can be identified at better than 3.5 sigma in almost all cases, with the only remaining ambiguity caused by the inability to distinguish strange from down quarks. "
"In [KW14], the new concept of Feynman categories was introduced to simplify the discussion of operad--like objects. In this present paper, we demonstrate the usefulness of this approach, by introducing the concept of decorated Feynman categories. The procedure takes a Feynman category $\mathfrak F$ and a functor $\mathcal O$ to a monoidal category to produce a new Feynman category ${\mathfrak F}_{dec {\mathcal O}}$. This in one swat explains the existence of non--sigma operads, non--sigma cyclic operads, and the non--sigma--modular operads of Markl as well as all the usual candidates simply from the category $\mathfrak G$, which is a full subcategory of the category of graphs of [BM08]. Moreover, we explain the appearance of terminal objects noted in [Mar15]. We can then easily extend this for instance to the dihedral case. Furthermore, we obtain graph complexes and all other known operadic type notions from decorating and restricting the basic Feynman category $\mathfrak G$ of aggregates of corollas. We additionally show that the construction is functorial. There are further geometric and number theoretic applications, which will follow in a separate preprint. "
"We consider self-propelled particles undergoing run-and-tumble dynamics (as exhibited by E. coli) in one dimension. Building on previous analyses at drift-diffusion level for the one-particle density, we add both interactions and noise, enabling discussion of domain formation by ""self-trapping"", and other collective phenomena. Mapping onto detailed-balance systems is possible in certain cases. "
"For maximal planar graphs of order $n\geq 4$, we prove that a vertex--coloring containing no rainbow faces uses at most $\lfloor\frac{2n-1}{3}\rfloor$ colors, and this is best possible. For maximal graph embedded on the projective plane, we obtain the analogous best bound $\lfloor\frac{2n+1}{3}\rfloor$. The main ingredients in the proofs are classical homological tools. By considering graphs as topological spaces, we introduce the notion of a null coloring, and prove that for any graph $G$ a maximal null coloring $f$ is such that the quotient graph $G/f$ is a forest. "
"A magneto-hydrostatic model is constructed with spectropolarimetric properties close to those of solar photospheric magnetic bright points. Results of solar radiative magneto-convection simulations are used to produce the spatial structure of the vertical component of the magnetic field. The horizontal component of magnetic field is reconstructed using the self-similarity condition, while the magneto-hydrostatic equilibrium condition is applied to the standard photospheric model with the magnetic field embedded. Partial ionisation processes are found to be necessary for reconstructing the correct temperature structure of the model. The structures obtained are in good agreement with observational data. By combining the realistic structure of the magnetic field with the temperature structure of the quiet solar photosphere, the continuum formation level above the equipartition layer can be found. Preliminary results are shown of wave propagation through this magnetic structure. The observational consequences of the oscillations are examined in continuum intensity and in the Fe I 6302\AA\ magnetically sensitive line. "
"We study $B_c \to (D,\,D^{\ast})\,l\,\nu$ semileptonic decays mediated via $b \to u\,l\,\nu$ charged current interactions using the $B_c \to (D,\,D^{\ast})$ transition form factors obtained in the covariant light front quark model. We give predictions on the branching ratios, ratio of branching ratios, and various asymmetries pertaining to these decay modes within the standard model. These results can be tested in the ongoing or in the future experiments and can provide complimentary information regarding the observed anomalies in $B \to (D,\,D^{\ast})\tau\nu$ and $B_c \to J/\Psi\tau\nu$ decays. "
"The splitting in energy of gauge field vacua on the non-simply connected space $S^3/Z_2$ is reconsidered. We show the calculation to the one-loop level for a Yang-Mills vector with a ghost field. We confirm our previous result and give a solution to the question posed by Freire, Rom\~ao and Barroso. "
"The de Branges--Rovnyak spaces are known to provide an alternate functional model for contractions on a Hilbert space, equivalent to the Sz.-Nagy--Foias model. The scalar de Branges--Rovnyak spaces $\mathcal{H}(b)$ have essentially different properties, according to whether the defining function $b$ is or not extreme in the unit ball of $H^\infty$. For $b$ extreme the model space is just $\mathcal{H}(b)$, while for $b$ nonextreme an additional construction is required. In the present paper we identify the precise class of contractions which have as a model $\mathcal{H}(b)$ with $b$ nonextreme. "
"We study the $2\rightarrow1$ process of electron-positron pair annihilation to a single photon in a plane-wave background. The probability of the process in a pulsed plane wave is presented, and a locally constant field approximation is derived and benchmarked against exact results. The stricter kinematics of annihilation (compared to the $1\rightarrow2$ processes usually studied) leads to a stronger dependence on the incoming particle states. We demonstrate this by studying the effect that initial state wavepackets have on the annihilation probability. The effect of annihilation in a distribution of particles is studied by incorporating the process into Monte Carlo simulations. "
"Disjoint $n$-amalgamation is a condition on a complete first-order theory specifying that certain locally consistent families of types are also globally consistent. In this paper, we show that if a countably categorical theory $T$ admits an expansion with disjoint $n$-amalgamation for all $n$, then $T$ is pseudofinite. All theories which admit an expansion with disjoint $n$-amalgamation for all $n$ are simple, but the method can be extended, using filtrations of Fra\""iss\'e classes, to show that certain non-simple theories are pseudofinite. As case studies, we examine two generic theories of equivalence relations, $T^*_{\text{feq}}$ and $T_{\text{CPZ}}$, and show that both are pseudofinite. The theories $T^*_{\text{feq}}$ and $T_{\text{CPZ}}$ are not simple, but they are NSOP$_1$. This is established here for $T_{\text{CPZ}}$ for the first time. "
"In the wake of a preceding article \cite{RogUnt06} introducing the Schr\""odinger-Virasoro group, we study its affine action on a space of $(1+1)$-dimensional Schr\""odinger operators with time- and space-dependent potential $V$ periodic in time. We focus on the subspace corresponding to potentials that are at most quadratic in the space coordinate, which is in some sense the natural quantization of the space of Hill (Sturm-Liouville) operators on the one-dimensional torus. The orbits in this subspace have finite codimension, and their classification by studying the stabilizers can be obtained by extending Kirillov's results on the orbits of the space of Hill operators under the Virasoro group. We then explain the connection to the theory of Ermakov-Lewis invariants for time-dependent harmonic oscillators. These exact adiabatic invariants behave covariantly under the action of the Schr\""odinger-Virasoro group, which allows a natural classification of the orbits in terms of a monodromy operator on $L^2(\R)$ which is closely related to the monodromy matrix for the corresponding Hill operator.

"A knot-theoretic explanation is given for the rationality of the quenched QED beta function. At the link level, the Ward identity entails cancellation of subdivergences generated by one term of the skein relation, which in turn implies cancellation of knots generated by the other term. In consequence, each bare three-loop diagram has a rational Laurent expansion in the Landau gauge, as is verified by explicit computation. Comparable simplification is found to occur in scalar electrodynamics, when computed in the Duffin-Kemmer-Petiau formalism. "
"We explore how the local environment is related to properties of active galactic nuclei (AGNs) of various luminosities. Recent simulations and observations are converging on the view that the extreme luminosity of quasars, the brightest of AGNs, is fueled in major mergers of gas-rich galaxies. In such a picture, quasars, the highest luminosity AGNs, are expected to be located in regions with a higher density of galaxies on small scales where mergers are more likely to take place. However, in this picture, the activity observed in low-luminosity AGNs is due to secular processes that are less dependent on the local galaxy density. To test this hypothesis, we compare the local photometric galaxy density on kiloparsec scales around spectroscopic type I and type II quasars to the local density around lower-luminosity spectroscopic type I and type II AGNs. To minimize projection effects and evolution in the photometric galaxy sample we use to characterize AGN environments, we place our random control sample at the same redshift as our AGNs and impose a narrow redshift window around both the AGNs and control targets. Our results support these merger models for bright AGN origins. We find that the brightest sources have overdensities that increase on the smallest scales compared to dimmer sources. In addition, we investigate the nature of the quasar and AGN environments themselves and find that the increased overdensity of early-type galaxies in the environments of bright type I sources suggests that they are located in richer cluster environments than dim sources. We measure increased environment overdensity with increased quasar black hole mass, consistent with the well-known M_{DMH}-M_{BH} relationship, and find evidence for quenching in the environments of high accretion efficiency type I quasars. "
"Since the pioneering work by Koenker and Bassett (1978), quantile regression models and its applications have become increasingly popular and important for research in many areas. In this paper, a random effects ordinal quantile regression model is proposed for analysis of longitudinal data with ordinal outcome of interest. An efficient Gibbs sampling algorithm was derived for fitting the model to the data based on a location scale mixture representation of the skewed double exponential distribution. The proposed approach is illustrated using simulated data and a real data example. This is the first work to discuss quantile regression for analysis of longitudinal data with ordinal outcome. "
"A single McCulloch-Pitts neuron, that is, the simple perceptron is studied, with focus on the region beyond storage capacity. It is shown that Parisi's hierarchical ansatz for the overlap matrix of the synaptic couplings with so called continuous replica symmetry breaking is a solution, and as we propose it is the exact one, to the equilibrium problem. We describe some of the most salient features of the theory and give results about the low temperature region. In particular, the basics of the Parisi technique and the way to calculate thermodynamical expectation values is explained. We have numerically extremized the replica free energy functional for some parameter settings, and thus obtained the order parameter function, i.e., the probability distribution of overlaps. That enabled us to evaluate the probability density of the local stability parameter. We also performed a simulation and found a local stability density closer to the theoretical curve than previous numerical results were. "
"Cannon, Floyd and Parry have studied the modulus of finite subdivision rules extensively. We investigate the properties of the modulus of subdivision rules with linear and exponential growth at every vertex, using barycentric subdivision and a subdivision rule for the Borromean rings as examples. We show that the subdivision rule arising from the Borromean rings is conformal, and conjecture that the subdivision rules for all alternating links are conformal. We show that the 1,2,3-tile criterion of Cannon, Floyd, and Parry is sufficient to prove conformality for linear growth, but not exponential growth. We show that the criterion gives a weaker form of conformality for subdivision rules of exponential growth at each vertex. We contrast this with the known, bounded-valence case, and illustrate our results with circle packings using Ken Stephenson's Circlepack. "
"In order to analyze non-Markovianity of tripartite quantum states from a resource theoretical viewpoint, we introduce a class of quantum operations performed by three distant parties, and investigate an operational resource theory (ORT) induced it. A tripartite state is a free state if and only if it is a quantum Markov chain. We prove monotonicity of functions such as the conditional quantum mutual information, intrinsic information, squashed entanglement, a generalization of entanglement of purification, and the relative entropy of recovery. The ORT has five bound sets, each of which corresponds to one of the monotone functions. We introduce a task of ""non-Markovianity dilution"", and prove that the optimal rate for the task, namely the ""non-Markovianity cost"", is bounded from above by entanglement of purification in the case of pure states. We also propose a classical resource theory of non-Markovianity. "
"Natural language question-answering over RDF data has received widespread attention. Although there have been several studies that have dealt with a small number of aggregate queries, they have many restrictions (i.e., interactive information, controlled question or query template). Thus far, there has been no natural language querying mechanism that can process general aggregate queries over RDF data. Therefore, we propose a framework called NLAQ (Natural Language Aggregate Query). First, we propose a novel algorithm to automatically understand a users query intention, which mainly contains semantic relations and aggregations. Second, to build a better bridge between the query intention and RDF data, we propose an extended paraphrase dictionary ED to obtain more candidate mappings for semantic relations, and we introduce a predicate-type adjacent set PT to filter out inappropriate candidate mapping combinations in semantic relations and basic graph patterns. Third, we design a suitable translation plan for each aggregate category and effectively distinguish whether an aggregate item is numeric or not, which will greatly affect the aggregate result. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments over real datasets (QALD benchmark and DBpedia), and the experimental results demonstrate that our solution is effective. "
"The paper deals with the 2-D system of gas dynamics without pressure which was introduced in 1970 by Ya.Zeldovich to describe the formation of large-scale structure of the Universe. Such system occurs to be an intermediate object between the systems of ordinary differential equations and hyperbolic systems of PDE. The main its feature is the arising of singularities: discontinuities for velocity and delta functions of various types for density. The rigorous notion of generalized solutions in terms of Radon measures is introduced and the generalization of Rankine-Hugoniot conditions is obtained. On the basis of such conditions it is shown that the variational representation for the generalized solutions, which is valid for 1-D case, in 2-D case generally speaking does not take place. A nontrivial 1-D system of nonstrictly hyperbolic type is also obtained to describe the evolution inside the shock. "
"We present extensive computational results for the effective temperature, defined by the fluctuation-dissipation relation between the mean square displacement and the average displacement of grains, under the action of a weak, external perturbation, of a sheared, bi-disperse granular packing of compressible spheres. We study the dependence of this parameter on the shear rate and volume fractions, the type of particle and the observable in the fluctuation-dissipation relation. We find the same temperature for different tracer particles in the system. The temperature becomes independent on the shear rate for slow enough shear suggesting that it is the effective temperature of the jammed packing. However, we also show that the agreement of the effective temperature for different observables is only approximate, for very long times, suggesting that this defintion may not capture the full thermodynamics of the system. On the other hand, we find good agreement between the dynamical effective temperature and a compactivity calculated assuming that all jammed states are equiprobable. Therefore, this definition of temperature may capture an instance of the ergodic hypothesis for granular materials as proposed by theoretical formalisms for jamming. Finally, our simulations indicate that the average shear stress and apparent shear viscosity follow the usual relation with the shear rate for complex fluids. Our results show that the application of shear induces jamming in packings whose particles interact by tangential forces. "
"An alternative to extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) charts called mean squared error (MSE) charts that use a measure related to the MSE instead of mutual information is proposed. Using the relationship between mutual information and minimum mean squared error (MMSE), a relationship between the rate of any code and the area under a plot of MSE versus signal to noise ratio (SNR) is obtained, when the log likelihood ratios (LLR) can be assumed to be from a Gaussian channel. Using this result, a theoretical justification is provided for designing concatenated codes by matching the EXIT charts of the inner and outer decoders, when the LLRs are Gaussian which is typically assumed for code design using EXIT charts. Finally, for the special case of AWGN channel it is shown that any capacity achieving code has an EXIT curve that is flat. This extends Ashikhmin et als results for erasure channels to the Gaussian channel. "
"Nowadays, the demand for wireless mobile services is copious, and will continue increasing in the near future. Mobile cellular operators are therefore looking at the unlicensed spectrum as an economical supplement to augment the capacity of their soon-to-be overloaded networks. The same unlicensed bands are luring internet service providers, venue owners, and authorities into autonomously setting up and managing their high-performance private networks. In light of this exciting future, ensuring coexistence between multiple unlicensed technologies becomes a pivotal issue. So far this issue has been merely addressed via inefficient sharing schemes based on intermittent transmission. In this article, we present the fundamentals and the main challenges behind massive MIMO unlicensed, a brand-new approach for technology coexistence in the unlicensed bands, which is envisioned to boost spectrum reuse for a plethora of use cases. "
"We investigate the decay cascade of the Upsilon(nS) meson including the newly found Chi_b(3P) state in pp and PbPb collisions at LHC energies. The main goal is to quantitatively determine the additional suppression of the Upsilon(nS) states in PbPb collisions relative to pp at LHC energies of sqrt(s_NN) = 2.76 TeV when the Chi_b(3P) state is included together with the Upsilon(nS) and Chi_b(1P,2P) states. It is found that the suppression of Upsilon(1S) in PbPb collisions relative to pp is increased by at most 7% through the inclusion of Chi_b(3P), whereas the suppression factors for the Upsilon(2S) and Upsilon(3S) states do not change significantly. "
"An asymptotic expansions for the grand partition function of ideal Bose gas in the canonical ensemble with arbitrary number of particles is obtained. It is shown that the expressions found are valid in the whole temperature region, the critical temperature included. A comparison between the asymptotic formulas for Bose-condensate fluctuations and the exact ones is carried out and their quantitative agreement is established. "
"For each $n$, let $M_n$ be an $n\times n$ random matrix with independent $\pm 1$ entries. We show that ${\mathbb P}\{\mbox{$M_n$ is singular}\}=(1/2+o_n(1))^n$, which settles an old problem. Some generalizations are considered. "
"The Spectral Airglow Temperature Imager is an instrument, specially designed for investigation of the wave processes in the Mesosphere-Lower Thermosphere. In order to determine the kinematic parameters of a wave, the values of a physical quantity in different space points and their changes in the time should be known. As a result of the possibilities of the SATI instrument for space scanning, different parts of the images (sectors of spectrograms) correspond to the respective mesopause areas (where the radiation is generated). An approach is proposed for sector spectra determination from SATI images based on ordered statistics instead of meaning. Comparative results are shown. "
"Comprised of ferromagnetic edge-sharing CuO$_2$ chains that order in antialigned fashion at T$_N$=9 K, Li$_2$CuO$_2$ is found from local spin density calculations to display several surprising characteristics: (1) the ordered moment/f.u. of 0.92 $\mu_B$ is the largest for any low dimensional cuprate system, in agreement with experiment, (2) 40% of this moment lies on the neighboring O ions, making it the largest oxygen moment yet reported, and (3) the second neighbors couplings are larger than nearest neighbors couplings. All of these phenomena arise naturally due to a well defined effective $d_{yz}$ type orbital that includes very strong O $p_{\sigma}$ character. We interpret the large moment as surviving reduction by quantum fluctuations due to extension caused by the $d-p$ hybridization. "
"We performed observations of NGC1569 for 6 infrared bands (3.2, 4.1, 7, 11, 15, and 24 micron) with the Infrared Camera (IRC) onboard AKARI. Near- to mid-infrared (2--13 micron) spectroscopy of a Halpha filament was also carried out with the IRC. The extended structure associated with a Halpha filament appears bright at 7 micron, suggesting that the filament is bright at the UIR band emission. Follow-up spectroscopic observations with the IRC confirm the presence of 6.2, 7.7, and 11.3 micron emission in the filament. The filament spectrum exhibits strong 11.3 micron UIR band emission relative to the 7.7 micron band compared to the galaxy disk observed with the Infrared Spectrograph on Spitzer. The near-infrared spectrum also suggests the presence of excess continuum emission in 2.5--5 micron in the filament. The Halpha filament is thought to have been formed by the galactic outflow originating from the star-formation activity in the disk of NGC1569. The destruction timescale of the UIR band carriers in the outflow is estimated to be much shorter (~ 1.3 x 10^3 yr) than the timescale of the outflow (~ 5.3 Myr). Thus it is unlikely that the band carriers survive the outflow environment. Alternatively, we suggest that the band carriers in the filaments may be produced by the fragmentation of large carbonaceous grains in shocks, which produces the Halpha emission. The NIR excess continuum emission cannot be accounted for by free-free emission alone and a hot dust contribution may be needed, although the free-free emission intensity estimated from HI recombination lines has a large uncertainty. "
"A hybrid communication network with a common analog signal and an independent digital data stream as input to each node in a multiple access network is considered. The receiver/base-station has to estimate the analog signal with a given fidelity, and decode the digital streams with a low error probability. Treating the analog signal as a common state process, we set up a joint state estimation and communication problem in a Gaussian multiple access channel (MAC) with additive state. The transmitters have non-causal knowledge of the state process, and need to communicate independent data streams in addition to facilitating state estimation at the receiver. We first provide a complete characterization of the optimal trade-off between mean squared error distortion performance in estimating the state and the data rates for the message streams from two transmitting nodes. This is then generalized to an N-sender MAC. To this end, we show a natural connection between the state-dependent MAC model and a hybrid multi-sensor network in which a common source phenomenon is observed at N transmitting nodes. Each node encodes the source observations as well as an independent message stream over a Gaussian MAC without any state process. The receiver is interested estimating the source and all the messages. Again the distortion-rate performance is characterized. "
"Hadronic tau decays provide several ways to extract the Cabbibo-Kobashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix element V_{us}. The most precise determination involves using inclusive tau decays and requires as input the total branching ratio into strange final states. Recent results from B-factories have led to a discrepancy of about 3.4 sigma from the value of V_{us} implied by CKM unitarity and direct determination from Kaon semi-leptonic modes. In this paper we predict the three leading strange tau branching ratios, using dispersive parameterizations of the hadronic form factors and taking as experimental input the measured Kaon decay rates and the tau -> K pi nu_tau decay spectrum. We then use our results to reevaluate V_{us}, for which we find |V_{us}|=0.2207 \pm 0.0027, in better agreement with CKM unitarity. "
"Defect prevention is the most vital but habitually neglected facet of software quality assurance in any project. If functional at all stages of software development, it can condense the time, overheads and wherewithal entailed to engineer a high quality product. The key challenge of an IT industry is to engineer a software product with minimum post deployment defects. This effort is an analysis based on data obtained for five selected projects from leading software companies of varying software production competence. The main aim of this paper is to provide information on various methods and practices supporting defect detection and prevention leading to thriving software generation. The defect prevention technique unearths 99% of defects. Inspection is found to be an essential technique in generating ideal software generation in factories through enhanced methodologies of abetted and unaided inspection schedules. On an average 13 % to 15% of inspection and 25% - 30% of testing out of whole project effort time is required for 99% - 99.75% of defect elimination. A comparison of the end results for the five selected projects between the companies is also brought about throwing light on the possibility of a particular company to position itself with an appropriate complementary ratio of inspection testing.

"The set $\mathscr{F}(2;2)$ of quadratic foliations on the complex projective plane can be identified with a \textsc{Zariski}'s open set of a projective space of dimension 14 on which acts $\mathrm{Aut}(\mathbb{P}^2(\mathbb{C})).$ We classify, up to automorphisms of $\mathbb{P}^2(\mathbb{C}),$ quadratic foliations with only one singularity. There are only four such foliations up to conjugacy; whereas three of them have a dynamic which can be easily described the dynamic of the fourth is still mysterious. This classification also allows us to describe the action of $\mathrm{Aut}(\mathbb{P}^2(\mathbb{C}))$ on $\mathscr{F}(2;2).$ On the one hand we show that the dimension of the orbits is more than 6 and that there are exactly two orbits of dimension $6;$ on the other hand we obtain that the closure of the generic orbit in $\mathscr{F} (2;2)$ contains at least seven orbits of dimension~7 and exactly one orbit of dimension $6.$ "
"The organic spinterface describes the spin-polarized properties that develop, due to charge transfer, at the interface between a ferromagnetic metal (FM) and the molecules of an organic semiconductor. Yet, if the latter is also magnetic (e.g. molecular spin chains), the interfacial magnetic coupling can generate complexity within magnetotransport experiments. Also, assembling this interface may degrade the properties of its constituents (e.g. spin crossover or non-sublimable molecules). To circumvent these issues, one can separate the molecular and FM films using a less reactive nonmagnetic metal (NM). Spin-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements on the prototypical system Co(001)//Cu/Mnphthalocyanine (MnPc) reveal that the Cu/MnPc spinterface atop ferromagnetic Co is highly spin-polarized at room temperature, up to Cu spacer thicknesses of at least 10 monolayers. Ab-initio theory describes a spin polarization of the topmost Cu layer after molecular hybridization that can be accompanied by magnetic hardening effects. This spinterface's unexpected robustness paves the way for 1) integrating electronically fragile molecules within organic spinterfaces, and 2) manipulating molecular spin chains using the well-documented spin transfer torque properties of the FM/NM bilayer. "
We prove the existence of an infinite family of smooth positive bound states for (N +1)-coupled long-wave--short-wave interaction equations. The system describes the interaction between N short waves and a long wave and is of interest in physics and fluid dynamics.
"We outline a method for dealing with the relaxation of optically excited NaI F centers in terms of a single effective frequency along a multimode coordinate. The 2s-2p mixing through coupling to a T_{1u} vibrational mode is also discussed with optimistic conclusions. Equilibrium nonradiative deexcitation rates are estimated and compared with intervibrational relaxations so as to assess the efficiency of the nonequilibrium DKR deexcitation. They show the former not to be competitive, due to the large number of phonons exchanged. "
"Mobile payments have increased significantly in the recent years and one-to-one money transfers are offered by a wide variety of smartphone applications. These applications usually support scan-and-pay -- a technique that allows a payer to easily scan the destination address of the payment directly from the payee's smartphone screen. This technique is pervasive because it does not require any particular hardware, only the camera, which is present on all modern smartphones. However, in this work we show that a malicious application can exploit the overlay feature on Android to compromise the integrity of transactions that make use of the scan-and-pay technique. We implement Malview, a proof-of-concept malicious application that runs in the background on the payee's smartphone and show that it succeeds in redirecting payments to a malicious wallet. We analyze the weaknesses of the current defense mechanisms and discuss possible countermeasures against the attack. "
"Watkins' conjecture asserts that for a rational elliptic curve $E$ the degree of the modular parametrization is divisible by $2^r$, where $r$ is the rank of $E$. In this paper we prove that if the modular degree is odd then $E$ has rank $0$. Moreover, we prove that the conjecture holds for all rank two rational elliptic curves of prime conductor and positive discriminant. "
"Composing fashion outfits involves deep understanding of fashion standards while incorporating creativity for choosing multiple fashion items (e.g., Jewelry, Bag, Pants, Dress). In fashion websites, popular or high-quality fashion outfits are usually designed by fashion experts and followed by large audiences. In this paper, we propose a machine learning system to compose fashion outfits automatically. The core of the proposed automatic composition system is to score fashion outfit candidates based on the appearances and meta-data. We propose to leverage outfit popularity on fashion oriented websites to supervise the scoring component. The scoring component is a multi-modal multi-instance deep learning system that evaluates instance aesthetics and set compatibility simultaneously. In order to train and evaluate the proposed composition system, we have collected a large scale fashion outfit dataset with 195K outfits and 368K fashion items from Polyvore. Although the fashion outfit scoring and composition is rather challenging, we have achieved an AUC of 85% for the scoring component, and an accuracy of 77% for a constrained composition task. "
"The aim of this paper is to show an existence theorem for a kinetic model of coagulation-fragmentation with initial data satisfying the natural physical bounds, and assumptions of finite number of particles and finite $L^p$-norm. We use the notion of renormalized solutions introduced dy DiPerna and Lions, because of the lack of \textit{a priori} estimates. The proof is based on weak-compactness methods in $L^1$, allowed by $L^p$-norms propagation. "
"Initializing and measuring the wave-function of single freely-propagating particles are challenging but fundamental tasks for applications in quantum information processing and enhanced sensing. Recently, continuous-variable quantum tomography techniques developed for atomic beams and photonic modes have been adapted for on-demand electronic excitations but are limited to the region in energy-time phase space immediately around the Fermi level. Here we present a general, broad-band method for mapping the single-particle phase space Wigner distribution. We reconstruct the Wigner representation of the mixed-state density matrix for \textit{solitary} electrons emitted by an on-demand source. This reveals highly localised distributions isolated from the Fermi sea. Our method can be used to test the degree of `quantumness' of an electron source from measurements of the phase-space density. While both source purity and detector fidelity are suppressed by classical fluctuations, here we resolve fine structure of the wavepackets (a chirp controlled by emission conditions) and find that the resolution should be sufficient to enable quantum-limited measurements. Our technique will provide key information required to master electron coherence and entanglement at the individual particle level, for instance to create excitations from multiple sources that are indistinguishable. "
"It has recently been suggested that observed galaxy rotation curves can be accounted for by general relativity without recourse to dark-matter halos. A number of objections have been raised, which have been addressed by the authors. Here, the calculation of tangential velocity is questioned. "
"One of the simplest metalearning methods is the average ranking method. This method uses metadata in the form of test results of a given set of algorithms on given set of datasets and calculates an average rank for each algorithm. The ranks are used to construct the average ranking. We investigate the problem of how the process of generating the average ranking is affected by incomplete metadata including fewer test results. This issue is relevant, because if we could show that incomplete metadata does not affect the final results much, we could explore it in future design. We could simply conduct fewer tests and save thus computation time. In this paper we describe an upgraded average ranking method that is capable of dealing with incomplete metadata. Our results show that the proposed method is relatively robust to omission in test results in the meta datasets. "
In this paper we consider a generalized conditional-type Holder- inequality and investigate some classic properties of multiplication conditional expectation type operators on Orlicz-spaces.
Let p be an odd prime. Let G be a p-local finite group over the extraspecial p-group p_+^{1+2}. In this paper we study the cohomology and the stable splitting of their p-complete classifying space BG.
By complexity of a finite graph we mean the number of spanning trees in the graph. The aim of the present paper is to give a new approach for counting complexity $\tau(n)$ of cyclic $n$-fold coverings of a graph. We give an explicit analytic formula for $\tau(n)$ in terms of Chebyshev polynomials and find its asymptotic behavior as $n\to\infty$ through the Mahler measure of the associated voltage polynomial. We also prove that $F(x)=\sum\limits_{n=1}^\infty\tau(n)x^n$ is a rational function with integer coefficients.
"In this paper, we discuss the MSSM extended with one vector-like lepton doublets $L$-$\overline{L}$ and one right-handed neutrino $N$. The neutral vecotor-like sneutrino can be a candidate of dark matter. In order to avoid the interaction with the necleons by exchanging a $Z$-boson, the mass splitting between the real part and the imaginary part of the sneutrino field is needed. Compared with the MSSM sneutrino dark matter, the mass splitting between the vector-like sneutrino field can be more naturally acquired without large A-terms and constraints on the neutralino masses. We have also calculated the relic density and the elastic scattering cross sections with the neucleons in the cases that the dark matter particles coannihilate with or without the MSSM slepton doublets. The elastic scattering cross sections with the neucleons are well below the LUX bounds. In the case that the dark matter coannihilate with all the MSSM slepton doublets, the mass of the dark matter can be as light as 370 GeV. "
"It is well known that options can make planning more efficient, among their many benefits. Thus far, algorithms for autonomously discovering a set of useful options were heuristic. Naturally, a principled way of finding a set of useful options may be more promising and insightful. In this paper we suggest a mathematical characterization of good sets of options using tools from information theory. This characterization enables us to find conditions for a set of options to be optimal and an algorithm that outputs a useful set of options and illustrate the proposed algorithm in simulation. "
"The chemical bonding in an epitaxial ZrB2 film is investigated by Zr K-edge (1s) X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectroscopies and compared to the ZrB2 compound target from which the film was synthesized as well as a bulk {\alpha}-Zr reference. Quantitative analysis of X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy spectra reveals at the surface: ~5% O in the epitaxial ZrB2 film, ~19% O in the ZrB2 compound target and ~22% O in the bulk {\alpha}-Zr reference after completed sputter cleaning. For the ZrB2 compound target, X-ray diffraction (XRD) shows weak but visible -111, 111, and 220 peaks from monoclinic ZrO2 together with peaks from ZrB2 and where the intensity distribution for the ZrB2 peaks show a randomly oriented target material. For the bulk {\alpha}-Zr reference no peaks from any crystalline oxide were visible in the diffractogram recorded from the 0001-oriented metal. The Zr K-edge absorption from the two ZrB2 samples demonstrate more pronounced oscillations for the epitaxial ZrB2 film than in the bulk ZrB2 attributed to the high atomic ordering within the columns of the film. The XANES exhibits no pre-peak due to lack of p-d hybridization in ZrB2, but with a chemical shift towards higher energy of 4 eV in the film and 6 eV for the bulk compared to {\alpha}-Zr (17.993 keV) from the charge-transfer from Zr to B. The 2 eV larger shift in bulk ZrB2 material suggests higher oxygen content than in the epitaxial film, which is supported by XPS. In EXAFS, the modelled cell-edge in ZrB2 is slightly smaller in the thin film (a=3.165 {\AA}, c=3.520 {\AA}) in comparison to the bulk target material (a=3.175 {\AA}, c=3.540 {\AA}) while in hexagonal closest-packed metal ({\alpha}-phase, a=3.254 {\AA}, c=5.147 {\AA}).

"We present the results of an 80 ks Chandra ACIS-S observation of the double pulsar system J0737-3039. Furthermore, we report on spectral, spatial and timing analysis of the combined X-ray observations performed so far for this system. Fitting a total of ~1100 photons, we show that the X-ray spectrum of the J0737-3039 system is very soft, and not satisfactorily modeled by a simple blackbody or an atmospheric model. However, it is not possible yet to discriminate between a predominantly non-thermal and a predominantly thermal origin for the X-ray emission. Adopting a simple power-law emission model, the photon index (Gamma=3.7) and the implied conversion efficiency of the rotational energy of PSR J0737-3039A into X-ray emission (4.1x10^-4, for a distance to the source of 500 pc) are compatible with the X-ray photons being emitted in the magnetosphere of PSR J0737-3039A. This hypothesis is also supported by the absence of detectable X-ray orbital modulation (up to ~20%) or any X-ray nebular emission and it is in agreement with the high (~75%) X-ray pulsed fraction of PSR J0737-3039A. A two blackbody or a Comptonized blackbody model also reproduce the data, and the upper limit to the value of the hydrogen column density N_H <10^20 cm^-2, is in better agreement (with respect to the power-law model) with the Galactic N_H in that direction and at that distance. For the two blackbody model the implied emission radii and temperatures are also compatible with those seen in other recycled pulsars, calling for the bulk of the X-ray photons being originated from heated regions at the surface of pulsar A. On the other hand, in the Comptonized blackbody model, the electron temperature seems to be significantly smaller than in other similar objects. "
"Work is devoted to physics of current transport in a wide class of the hetero-phase granulated mediums and similar systems with set of metal or semi-conductor granules, quantum dots or potential wells in which the exit from Coulomb blockade tunneling regime can be not observable because of irreversible breakdown and destruction of structure of medium. Such systems also concern and the condensed mediums with short distanced atoms of transition elements. In article for small and average electric fields the analytical decision of a stationary problem of discrete electronic transport through a chain of as much as big number of metal granules in area Coulomb tunneling blockade is performed. It is deduced the exponential law of growth of a current with electric field in such granulated systems. The characteristic feature of discrete tunneling in such medium is the volt-ampere characteristic type I exp(V/(N+1)kT) with great value N>> 1. Examples of application of the theory for explanation of current transport in porous silicon, synthesised by ionic implantation of nitrogen in silicon layers of nitride of silicon or glass like amorphous semiconductors are resulted.

"The actuator disk model (ADM) continues to be a popular wind turbine representation in large eddy simulations (LES) of large wind farms. Computational restrictions typically limit the number of grid points across the rotor of each actuator disk and require spatial filtering to smoothly distribute the applied force distribution on discrete grid points. At typical grid resolutions, simulations cannot capture all of the vorticity shed behind the disk and subsequently over-predict power by upwards of 10%. To correct these modeling errors, we propose a vortex cylinder model to quantify the shed vorticity when a filtered force distribution is applied at the actuator disk. This model is then used to derive a correction factor for numerical simulations that collapses the power curve for simulations at various filter widths and grid resolutions onto the curve obtained using axial momentum theory. The proposed correction therefore facilitates accurate power measurements in LES without resorting to highly refined numerical grids. "
"Schroedinger equation with imaginary PT-symmetric potential $V^{}(x) = i\,x^3$ is studied using the numerical discretization methods in both the coordinate and momentum representations. In the former case our results confirm that the model generates an infinite number of bound states with real energies. In the latter case the differential equation is of the third order and a square-well, solvable approximation of kinetic energy is recommended and discussed. One finds that in the strong-coupling limit, the exact PT-symmetric solutions converge to their Hermitian predecessors. "
"The equivariant cohomology of a space with a group action is not only a ring but also an algebra over the cohomology ring of the classifying space of the acting group. We prove that toric manifolds (i.e. compact smooth toric varieties) are isomorphic as varieties if and only if their equivariant cohomology algebras are weakly isomorphic. We also prove that quasitoric manifolds, which can be thought of as a topological counterpart to toric manifolds, are equivariantly homeomorphic if and only if their equivariant cohomology algebras are isomorphic.

"The inner region of the accretion disk onto a rotating magnetized central star (neutron star, white dwarf or T Tauri star) is subjected to magnetic torques which induce warping and precession of the disk. The origin of these torques lies in the interaction between the (induced) surface current on the disk and the horizontal magnetic field (parallel to the disk) produced by the inclined magnetic dipole. Under quite general conditions, there exists a magnetic warping instability in which the magnetic torque drives the disk plane away from the equatorial plane of the star toward a state where the disk normal vector is perpendicular to the spin axis. Viscous stress tends to suppress the warping instability at large radii, but the magnetic torque always dominates as the disk approaches the magnetosphere boundary. The magnetic torque also drives the tilted inner disk into retrograde precession around the stellar spin axis. Moreover, resonant magnetic forcing on the disk can occur which may affect the dynamics of the disk. The magnetically driven warping instability and precession may be related to a number observational puzzles, including: (1) Spin evolution (torque reversal) of accreting X-ray pulsars; (2) Quasi-periodic oscillations in low-mass X-ray binaries; (3) Super-orbital periods in X-ray binaries; (4) Photometric period variations of T Tauri stars.

"We explicitly study how jet substructure taggers act on a set of signal and background events. We focus on two-pronged hadronic decay of a boosted Z boson. The background to this process comes from QCD jets with masses of the order of m_Z. We find a way to compare various taggers within a single framework by applying them to the most relevant splitting in a jet. We develop a tool, TOY-TAG, which allows one to get insight into what happens when a particular tagger is applied to a set of signal or background events. It also provides estimates for significance and purity. We use our tool to analyze differences between various taggers and potential ways to improve the performance by combining several of them. "
"We study the quasiclassical expansion associated with a complex curve. In a more specific context this is the 1/N expansion in U(N)-invariant matrix integrals. We compare two approaches, the CFT approach and the topological recursion, and show their equivalence. The CFT approach reformulates the problem in terms of a conformal field theory on a Riemann surface, while the topological recursion is based on a recurrence equation for the observables representing symplectic invariants on the complex curve. The two approaches lead to two different graph expansions, one of which can be obtained as a partial resummation of the other. "
"We consider several renormalizable, scale free models in three space-time dimensions which involve scalar and spinor fields. The Yukawa couplings are bilinear in both the spinor and scalar fields and the potential is of sixth order in the scalar field. In a model with a single scalar field and a complex Fermion field in three Euclidean dimensions, the couplings in the theory are both asymptotically free. This property is not retained in 2+1 dimensional Minkowski space, as we illustrate by considering a renormalizable scale-free supersymmetric model. This is on account of the different properties of the Dirac matrices in Euclidean and Minkowski space. We also examine a model in 2+1 dimensional Minkowski space in which two species of Fermions, associated with the two unitarily inequivalent representations of the $2 \times 2$ Dirac matrices, couple in two different ways to two distinct scalar fields. There are two types of Yukawa couplings in this model, and either one or the other of them can be asymptotically free (but not both simultaneously). "
"We report an SMA interferometric identification of a bright submillimeter source, GOODS 850-5. This source is one of the brightest 850 um sources in the GOODS-N but is extremely faint at all other wavelengths. It is not detected in the GOODS HST ACS images and only shows a weak 2 sigma signal at 1.4 GHz. It is detected in the Spitzer IRAC bands and the MIPS 24 um band, however, with very low fluxes. We present evidence in the radio, submillimeter, mid-IR, near-IR, and optical that suggest GOODS 850-5 may be a z>4 galaxy. "
"Dedicated short range communication (DSRC) relies on secure distribution to vehicles of a certificate revocation list (CRL) for enabling security protocols. CRL distribution utilizing vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications is preferred to an infrastructure-only approach. One approach to V2V CRL distribution, using rateless coding at the source and forwarding at vehicle relays is vulnerable to a pollution attack in which a few malicious vehicles forward incorrect packets which then spread through the network leading to denial-of-service. This paper develops a new scheme called Precode-and-Hash that enables efficient packet verification before forwarding thereby preventing the pollution attack. In contrast to rateless codes, it utilizes a fixed low-rate precode and random selection of packets from the set of precoded packets. The fixed precode admits efficient hash verification of all encoded packets. Specifically, hashes are computed for all precoded packets and sent securely using signatures. We analyze the performance of the Precode-and-Hash scheme for a multi-hop line network and provide simulation results for several schemes in a more realistic vehicular model. "
An improved criterion for distinguishing conditions in which classical or quantum behavior occurs is developed by comparing classical and quantum mechanical measures of size while incorporating spatial and temporal restrictions on wave packet formation associated with limitations on spatial extent and duration.
"Motivated by the recent dilaton-based proof of the 4d a-theorem, we study the dilaton effective action for RG flows in d dimensions. When d is even, the action consists of a Wess-Zumino (WZ) term, whose Weyl-variation encodes the trace-anomaly, plus all Weyl-invariants. For d odd, the action consists of Weyl-invariants only. We present explicit results for the flat-space limit of the dilaton effective action in d-dimensions up to and including 8-derivative terms. GJMS-operators from conformal geometry motivate a form of the action that unifies the Weyl-invariants and anomaly-terms into a compact general-d structure. A new feature in 8d is the presence of an 8-derivative Weyl-invariant that pollutes the O(p^8)-contribution from the WZ action to the dilaton scattering amplitudes; this may challenge a dilaton-based proof of an a-theorem in 8d. We use the example of a free massive scalar for two purposes: 1) it allows us to confirm the structure of the d-dimensional dilaton effective action explicitly; we carry out this check for d=3,4,5,...,10; and 2) in 8d we demonstrate how the flow (a_UV - a_IR) can be extracted systematically from the O(p^8)-amplitudes despite the contamination from the 8-derivative Weyl-invariant. This computation gives a value for the a-anomaly of the 8d free conformal scalar that is shown to match the value obtained from zeta-function regularization of the log-term in the free energy. "
"The introduction of Fuzzy Relational Equations (FREs) has made problems that were unsolvable using algebraic linear equations into solvable ones. FREs have been applied to problemsin medicine, industry, transportation and all types of social problems where the data is an unsupervised one. Yet, FREs lack the capacity to tackle problems where an element of indeterminacy is involved. This book develops the new concept of Neutrosophic Relational Equations (NREs) that have the capacity to analyze problems with indeterminacy. Here, earlier models on FREs are analyzed and new NRE models, with practical applications, are presented. "
"Some parallel constructions of a SHAKE hash function using Sakura coding are introduced, whose basic operation is the Keccak's permutation. For each proposed tree-based algorithm, observations are made on both its parallel running time (depth) and the required number of processors to reach it. This preliminary work makes the assumption that the tree-level chaining value length is equal to the capacity of the underlying sponge construction, as recommended in the Sakura paper. "
"In this paper, we develop the averaging principle for a class of two-time-scale stochastic reaction-diffusion equations driven by Wiener processes and Poisson random measures. We assume that all coefficients of the equation have polynomial growth, and the drift term of the equation is non-Lipschitz. Hence, the classical formulation of the averaging principle under the Lipschitz condition is no longer available. To prove the validity of the averaging principle, the existence and uniqueness of the mild solution are proved firstly. Then, the existence of time-dependent evolution family of measures associated with the fast equation is studied, by which the averaged coefficient is obtained. Finally, the validity of the averaging principle is verified. "
The objective of this paper is to give a concrete interpretation of the dimension of the first Hochschild cohomology space of a cyclically oriented or tame cluster tilted algebra in terms of a numerical invariant arising from the potential.
"We study the spin-1 Ising model with bilinear and biquadratic exchange interactions and single-ion crystal field. In addition to the four usual phases: disordered DIS, ferromagnetic FER, antiquadrupolar AQU and ferrimagnetic FRI, we found three new phases in the case of a thin magnetic film, namely: the sublattice A non magnetic phase NMA, the sublattice B non magnetic phase NMB and the global non magnetic phase NMG. These phases are studied, for each layer of the film, either in the temperature-crystal field plane $(T,\Delta)$ or in the biquadratic coupling-crystal field plane $(d,\Delta)$, for diferent film thicknesses. On the other hand, the thermal behaviour of the layer quadrupolar moments $q_{A}, q_{B}$ and layer magnetisations $m_{A}, m_{B}$ are investigated for negative values of the biquadratic coupling and crystal field. It is also found that for fixed values of the biquadratic coupling, the temperature and the crystal field, each layer of the film can belong to a differnt phase. To illustrate this situation, an example is given for $d=-3.0$, $\Delta =-3.0$ and $T=1.3$. "
"We present the identification and characterization of the optical counterpart to 2XMM J011942.7+032421, one of the most luminous and distant ultra-luminous X-ray sources (ULXs). The counterpart is located near a star forming region in a spiral arm of the galaxy NGC 470 with u, g, and r magnitudes of 21.53, 21.69, and 21.71 mags, respectively. The luminosity of the counterpart is much larger than that of a single O-type star, indicating that it may be a stellar cluster. Our optical spectroscopic observations confirm the association of the X-ray source and the optical counterpart with its host galaxy NGC 470, which validates the high, > 10^41 erg/s, X-ray luminosity of the source. Its optical spectrum is embedded with numerous emission lines, including H recombination lines, metallic forbidden lines and more notably the high-ionization HeII (lambda 4686 A) line. This line shows a large velocity dispersion of $\simeq$ 410 \kms, consistent with the existence of a compact (< 5 AU) highly-ionized accretion disc rotating around the central X-ray source. The 1.4 x 10^37 erg/s luminosity of the HeII line emission makes the source one of the most luminous ULXs in the emission of that line. This, together with the high X-ray luminosity and the large velocity dispersion of the HeII emission, suggests that the source is an ideal candidate for more extensive follow-up observations for understanding the nature of hyper-luminous X-ray sources, a more luminous subgroup of ULXs and more likely candidates for intermediate-mass black holes. "
"This is the first meeting specifically devoted to the topic of cluster soft excess and related phenomena. It calls together a group of some 40 scientists, mostly experts in the field, to present their findings on the observational aspects of emission from clusters, signature of the WHIM in the cluster, intergalactic, and local environment, theoretical modeling of the WHIM in cosmological hydrodynamic simulations, theory and observations of cluster cosmic rays, magnetic fields, radio data and the use of the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect as a means of constraining the important parameters. We are particularly grateful to F.J. Lockman and S.L. Snowden for presenting their latest picture of the cold gas distribution in the interstellar medium, as this affects our ability to model extragalactic EUV and soft X-ray data via Galactic absorption by HI and HeI. Papers given on future hardware concepts to further the spatial and spectral diagnosis of diffuse soft X-ray emission in general are also included. "
The Hubble Deep Field-South (HDF-S) was chosen to have a QSO (RA 22:33:37.6 Dec -60:33:29 J2000 and B=17.5) in the field to allow for studies of absorption systems intersecting the sight line to the QSO. To assist in the planning of HDF-S observations we present here a ground-based spectrum of the QSO. We measure a redshift of z=2.24 for the QSO and find associated absorption in the spectrum at z=2.204 as well as additional absorption features.
"We study the Landau pole in the lambda phi^4 field theory at non-zero and large temperatures. We show that the position of the thermal Landau pole Lambda_L(T) is shifted to higher energies with respect to the zero temperature Landau pole Lambda_L(0). We find for high temperatures T > Lambda_L(0), Lambda_L(T) simeq pi^2 T / log (T / Lambda_L(0)). Therefore, the range of applicability in energy of the lambda phi^4 field theory increases with the temperature. "
"We introduce a new braid-theoretic framework with which to understand the Legendrian and transversal classification of knots, namely a Legendrian Markov Theorem without Stabilization which induces an associated transversal Markov Theorem without Stabilization. We establish the existence of a nontrivial knot-type specific Legendrian and transversal MTWS by enhancing the Legendrian mountain range for the (2,3)-cable of a (2,3)-torus knot provided by Etnyre and Honda, and showing that elementary negative flypes allow us to move toward maximal tb value without having to use Legendrian stabilization. In doing so we obtain new ways to visualize convex tori and Legendrian divides and rulings, using tilings and braided rectangular diagrams. "
"The Reeb graph of a function on a smooth manifold is the graph obtained as the space of all connected components of inverse images such that the set of all vertices coincides with the set of all connected components of inverse images including singular points. Reeb graphs are fundamental and important in the algebraic and differential topological theory of Morse functions and their generalizations, or in other words, the theory of global singularitiy. In this paper, as a related fundamental and important study, for given graphs, we construct certain smooth functions inducing the graphs as the Reeb graphs. Such works have been demonstrated by Masumoto, Michalak, Saeki, Sharko etc. and also by the author since 2000s. We present new smooth functions on $3$-dimensional closed orientable manifolds through explicit constructive methods. "
The Mott transition in a two-band Hubbard model involving subbands of different widths is studied as a function of temperature using dynamical mean field theory combined with exact diagonalization. The phase diagram is shown to exhibit two successive first-order transitions if the full Hund's rule coupling is included. In the absence of spin-flip and pair-exchange terms the lower transition remains first-order while the upper becomes continuous.
"We show that for any commutative noetherian regular ring $R$ containing $\Q$, the map $K_1(R) \to K_1(\frac{R[x_1, \cdots , x_4]}{(x_1x_2 - x_3x_4)})$ is an isomorphism. This answers a question of Gubeladze. We also compute the higher $K$-theory of this monoid algebra. In particular, we show that the above isomorphism does not extend to all higher $K$-groups. We give applications to a question of Lindel on the Serre dimension of monoid algebras. "
"I introduce a new parametrization of a bosonic Lax operator for the algebraic Bethe ansatz method with the $gl(2)$-invariant $R$-matrix and use it to present the exact solution of a generalized two-sites Bose-Hubbard model with asymmetric tunnelling. In the no interaction limit I show that the Bethe ansatz equations can be written as a $S^{N-1}$ sphere, where $N$ is the total number of atoms in the condensate. "
"Using Floquet theory, we illustrate that Floquet Weyl fermions can be created in circularly-polarised-light-irradiated three-dimensional stacked graphene systems. One or two semi-Dirac points can be formed due to overlapping of Floquet sub-bands. Each pair of Weyl points have a two-component semi-Dirac point parent, instead of a four-component Dirac point parent. Decreasing the light frequency will make the Weyl points move in the momentum space, and the Weyl points can approach to the Dirac points when the frequency becomes very small. The frequency-amplitude phase diagram is worked out. It is shown that there exist Fermi arcs in the surface Brillouin zones in circularly-polarised-light-irradiated semi-infinitely-stacked and finitely-multilayered graphene systems. The Floquet Weyl points emerging due to the overlap of Floquet sub-bands provide a new platform to study Weyl fermions. "
"Lattice refinement in LQC, its meaning and its necessity are discussed. The r\^ole of lattice refinement for the realisation of a successful inflationary model is explicitly shown. A simple and effective numerical technique to solve the constraint equation for any choice of lattice refinement model is briefly illustrated. Phenomenological and consistency requirements leading to a particular choice of lattice refinement model are presented, while it is subsequently proved that only this choice of lattice refinement leads to a unique factor ordering in the Wheeler-De Witt equation, which is the continuum limit of LQC. "
"Data I/O poses a significant bottleneck in large-scale CFD simulations; thus, practitioners would like to significantly reduce the number of times the solution is saved to disk, yet retain the ability to recover any field quantity (at any time instance) a posteriori. The objective of this work is therefore to accurately recover missing CFD data a posteriori at any time instance, given that the solution has been written to disk at only a relatively small number of time instances. We consider in particular high-order discretizations (e.g., discontinuous Galerkin), as such techniques are becoming increasingly popular for the simulation of highly separated flows. To satisfy this objective, this work proposes a methodology consisting of two stages: 1) dimensionality reduction and 2) dynamics learning. For dimensionality reduction, we propose a novel hierarchical approach. First, the method reduces the number of degrees of freedom within each element of the high-order discretization by applying autoencoders from deep learning. Second, the methodology applies principal component analysis to compress the global vector of encodings. This leads to a low-dimensional state, which associates with a nonlinear embedding of the original CFD data. For dynamics learning, we propose to apply regression techniques (e.g., kernel methods) to learn the discrete-time velocity characterizing the time evolution of this low-dimensional state. A numerical example on a large-scale CFD example characterized by nearly 13 million degrees of freedom illustrates the suitability of the proposed method in an industrial setting. "
We report on a dry transfer technique for single wall carbon nanotube devices which allows to embed them in high finesse microwave cavity. We demonstrate the ground state charge readout and a quality factor of about 3000 down to the single photon regime. This technique allows to make devices such as double quantum dots which could be instrumental for achieving the strong spin photon coupling. It can easily be extended to generic carbon nanotube based microwave devices.
"The paper studies representation theoretic aspects of a nonabelian version of the Jacobian for a smooth complex projective surface $X$ introduced in [R1]. The sheaf of reductive Lie algebras $\bf\calG$ associated to the nonabelian Jacobian is determined and its Lie algebraic properties are explicitly related to the geometry of configurations of points on $X$. In particular, it is shown that the subsheaf of centers of $\bf\calG$ determines a distinguished decomposition of configurations into the disjoint union of subconfigurations. Furthermore, it is shown how to use $sl_2$-subalgebras associated to certain nilpotent elements of $\bf\calG$ to write equations defining configurations of $X$ in appropriate projective spaces. The same nilpotent elements are used to establish a relation of the nonabelian Jacobian with such fundamental objects in the representation theory as nilpotent orbits, Springer resolution and Springer fibres of simple Lie algebras of type $A_n$, for appropriate values of $n$. This leads to a construction of distinguished collections of objects in the category of representations of symmetric groups as well as in the category of perverse sheaves on the appropriate Hilbert schemes of points of $X$. Hence two ways of categorifying the second Chern class of vector bundles of rank 2 on smooth projective surfaces. We also give a `loop' version of the above construction by relating the nonabelian Jacobian to the Infinite Grassmannians of simple Lie groups of type $SL_n(\bf C)$, for appropriate values of n. This gives, via the geometric version of the Satake isomorphism, a distinguished collection of irreducible representations of the Langlands dual groups thus indicating a relation of the nonabelian Jacobian to the Langlands duality for smooth projective surfaces. "
"The Saha equations for photo-ionization process of hydrogen atoms and the creation of electron-positron pairs at high temperature are investigated in a reference frame undergoing a uniform accelerated motion in an otherwise flat Minkowski space-time geometry or equivalently, in a rest frame in presence of a strong uniform gravitational field. It is known as the Rindler space. "
"We extend our theory of electron--hole recombination in organic light emitting diodes to investigate the possibility that high energy singlet and triplet excited states with large electron--hole separations are generated in such processes, over and above the lowest singlet and triplet excitons. Our approach involves a time-dependent calculation of the interchain / intermolecular charge--transfer within model Hamiltonians that explicitly include electron-electron interactions between the $\pi$-electrons. We show that the electron--hole recombination reaction can be viewed as a tunneling process whose cross section depends on both the matrix element of the interchain part of Hamiltonian and the energy difference between the initial polaron--pair state and the final neutral states. There occurs a bifurcation of the electron--hole recombination path in each of the two spin channels that leads to the generation of both the lowest energy exciton and a specific high energy charge-transfer state, with the matrix elements favoring the lowest energy exciton and the energy difference factor favoring the higher energy state. The overall effect of the electron--electron interactions is to enhance the singlet:triplet yield ratio over the value of 0.25 predicted from statistical considerations that are valid only within noninteracting models. "
"The production of charmonia in ultrarelativistic heavy-ion collisions is investigated including two sources. These are a primordial contribution coupled with various phases of dissociation, and a statistical coalescence of $c$ and $\bar{c}$ quarks at the hadronization phase transition. Within a schematic fireball evolution, SPS data on $J/\Psi$ production can be reasonably well reproduced. Remaining discrepancies in the $\Psi'/\Psi$ ratio are discussed. Predictions for the $J/\Psi$ centrality dependence at RHIC energies are confronted with first data from PHENIX. The pertinent excitation function of the $N_{J/\Psi}/N_{c\bar{c}}$ ratio exhibits a characteristic minimum structure signaling the transition from the standard $J/\Psi$ suppression scenario (SPS) to predominantly statistical production (RHIC). "
"In this article we provide a general construction when $n\ge3$ for immersed in Euclidean $(n+1)$-space, complete, smooth, constant mean curvature hypersurfaces of finite topological type (in short CMC $n$-hypersurfaces). More precisely our construction converts certain graphs in Euclidean $(n+1)$-space to CMC $n$-hypersurfaces with asymptotically Delaunay ends in two steps: First appropriate small perturbations of the given graph have their vertices replaced by round spherical regions and their edges and rays by Delaunay pieces so that a family of initial smooth hypersurfaces is constructed. One of the initial hypersurfaces is then perturbed to produce the desired CMC $n$-hypersurface which depends on the given family of perturbations of the graph and a small in absolute value parameter $\underline\tau$. This construction is very general because of the abundance of graphs which satisfy the required conditions and because it does not rely on symmetry requirements. For any given $k\ge2$ and $n\ge3$ it allows us to realize infinitely many topological types as CMC $n$-hypersurfaces in $\mathbb R^{n+1}$ with $k$ ends. Moreover for each case there is a plethora of examples reflecting the abundance of the available graphs. This is in sharp contrast with the known examples which in the best of our knowledge are all (generalized) cylindrical obtained by ODE methods and are compact or with two ends. Furthermore we construct embedded examples when $k\ge3$ where the number of possible topological types for each $k$ is finite but tends to $\infty$ as $k\to\infty$. "
"High pressure behaviour of superhydrous phase B(HT) of Mg10Si3O14(OH)4 (Shy B) is investigated with the help of density functional theory based first principles calculations. In addition to the lattice parameters and equation of state, we use these calculations to determine the positional parameters of atoms as a function of pressure. Our results show that the compression induced structural changes involve cooperative distortions in the full geometry of the hydrogen bonds. The bond bending mechanism proposed by Hofmeister et al [1999] for hydrogen bonds to relieve the heightened repulsion due to short H--H contacts is not found to be effective in Shy B. The calculated O-H bond contraction is consistent with the observed blue shift in the stretching frequency of the hydrogen bond. These results establish that one can use first principles calculations to obtain reliable insights into the pressure induced bonding changes of complex minerals. "
"The Faddeev-Yakubovsky equations have been solved in configuration space for the four nucleon system. The n+t elastic cross section has been calculated using several realistic interactions and a phenomenological three-nucleon force. Special attention is devoted to the description of the observed resonant structure at $T_{lab}\approx 4$ MeV. In the present state of the calculations, the realistic NN interactions are unable to describe the energy region considered, i.e. n+t S- and P- waves. Whereas the inclusion of a three-nucleon force improves the zero energy region, the disagreement in the resonant peak remains. This failure contrasts with the results of a pure phenomenological model. The origin of this disagreement as well as the possible issues are discussed. "
A four dimensional generally covariant field theory is presented which describes non-dynamical three geometries coupled to scalar fields. The theory has an infinite number of physical observables (or constants of the motion) which are constructed from loops made from scalar field configurations. The Poisson algebra of these observables is closed and is the same as that for the 3+1 gravity loop variables in the Ashtekar formalism. The theory also has observables that give the areas of open surfaces and the volumes of finite regions. Solutions to all the Hamilton-Jacobi equations for the theory and the Dirac quantization conditions in the coordinate representation are given. These solutions are holonomies based on matter loops. A brief discussion of the loop space representation for the quantum theory is also given together with some implications for the quantization of 3+1 gravity.
"The Central Limit Theorem (CLT) for extrinsic and intrinsic means on manifolds is extended to a generalization of Fr\'echet means. Examples are the Procrustes mean for 3D Kendall shapes as well as a mean introduced by Ziezold. This allows for one-sample tests previously not possible, and to numerically assess the `inconsistency of the Procrustes mean' for a perturbation model and `inconsistency' within a model recently proposed for diffusion tensor imaging. Also it is shown that the CLT can be extended to mildly rank deficient diffusion tensors. An application to forestry gives the temporal evolution of Douglas fir tree stems tending strongly towards cylinders at early ages and tending away with increased competition. "
"We study the properties of the interstellar medium in the interacting system BR1202-0725 at z=4.7 via its [NII] and [CII] fine-structure line emission. This system consists of a QSO, a sub-mm galaxy (SMG), and two Ly-alpha emitters (LAEs). Such a diversity in galaxy properties makes BR1202-0725 a unique laboratory of star formation and galaxy evolution at high redshift. We present ionized nitrogen ([NII] 205 micron) observations of this system, obtained with the IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer. We find no [NII] emission at the quasar location, but tentative [NII] line detections associated with the SMG and one of the LAEs. Together with available ionized carbon ([CII] 158 micron) ALMA observations of this system, we find the following: The [CII]/[NII] luminosity ratio is >5.5 for the QSO and the SMG, but it is as low as ~2 in the LAE, suggesting that, in this source, most of the [CII] emission is associated with the ionized medium (HII regions) rather than the neutral one (PDRs). This study demonstrates the importance of combined studies of multiple fine--structure lines in order to pin down the physical properties of the interstellar medium in distant galaxies. "
"Linear Programming (LP) decoding of Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC) codes has attracted much attention in the research community in the past few years. The aim of LP decoding is to develop an algorithm which has error-correcting performance similar to that of the Sum-Product (SP) decoding algorithm, while at the same time it should be amenable to mathematical analysis. The LP decoding algorithm has also been extended to nonbinary linear codes by Flanagan et al. However, the most important problem with LP decoding for both binary and nonbinary linear codes is that the complexity of standard LP solvers such as the simplex algorithm remain prohibitively large for codes of moderate to large block length. To address this problem, Vontobel et al. proposed a low complexity LP decoding algorithm for binary linear codes which has complexity linear in the block length. In this paper, we extend the latter work and propose a low-complexity LP decoding algorithm for nonbinary linear codes. We use the LP formulation proposed by Flanagan et al. as a basis and derive a pair of primal-dual LP formulations. The dual LP is then used to develop the low-complexity LP decoding algorithm for nonbinary linear codes. In contrast to the binary low-complexity LP decoding algorithm, our proposed algorithm is not directly related to the nonbinary SP algorithm. Nevertheless, the complexity of the proposed algorithm is linear in the block length and is limited mainly by the maximum check node degree. As a proof of concept, we also present a simulation result for a $[80,48]$ LDPC code defined over $\mathbb{Z}_4$ using quaternary phase-shift keying over the AWGN channel, and we show that the error-correcting performance of the proposed LP decoding algorithm is similar to that of the standard LP decoding using the simplex solver.

"Quantum physics allows for unconditionally secure communication through insecure communication channels. The achievable rates of quantum-secured communication are fundamentally limited by the laws of quantum physics and in particular by the properties of entanglement. For a lossy communication line, this implies that the secret-key generation rate vanishes at least exponentially with the communication distance. We show that this fundamental limitation can be violated in a realistic scenario where the eavesdropper can store quantum information for only a finite, yet arbitrarily long, time. We consider communication through a lossy bononic channel (modeling linear loss in optical fibers) and we show that it is in principle possible to achieve a constant rate of key generation of one bit per optical mode over arbitrarily long communication distances. "
"The motion of a classical test particle moving on a 4-dimensional brane embedded in an $n$-dimensional bulk is studied in which the brane is allowed to fluctuate along the extra dimensions. It is shown that these fluctuations produce three different forces acting on the particle, all stemming from the effects of extra dimensions. Interpretations are then offered to describe the origin of these forces and a relationship between the 4 and $n$-dimensional mass of the particle is obtained by introducing charges associated with large extra dimensions. "
"In this paper we define a space $\ghu{M}$ of Hardy--Goldberg type on a measured metric space satisfying some mild conditions. We prove that the dual of $\ghu{M}$ may be identified with $\gbmo{M}$, a space of functions with ""local"" bounded mean oscillation, and that if $p$ is in $(1,2)$, then $\lp{M}$ is a complex interpolation space between $\ghu{M}$ and $\ld{M}$. This extends previous results of Strichartz, Carbonaro, Mauceri and Meda, and Taylor. Applications to singular integral operators on Riemannian manifolds are given. "
"It has recently been suggested that gauge invariance forbids the coupling of a massive color-octet vector meson to two gluons. While this is true for operators in an effective Lagrangian of dimension four or less, we demonstrate that dimension six interactions will lead to such couplings. In the case of technicolor, the result is a technirho-gluon-gluon coupling comparable to the naive vector meson dominance estimate, but with a substantial uncertainty. This has implications for several recent studies of technicolor phenomenology. "
"Deep learning methods exhibit promising performance for predictive modeling in healthcare, but two important challenges remain: -Data insufficiency:Often in healthcare predictive modeling, the sample size is insufficient for deep learning methods to achieve satisfactory results. -Interpretation:The representations learned by deep learning methods should align with medical knowledge. To address these challenges, we propose a GRaph-based Attention Model, GRAM that supplements electronic health records (EHR) with hierarchical information inherent to medical ontologies. Based on the data volume and the ontology structure, GRAM represents a medical concept as a combination of its ancestors in the ontology via an attention mechanism. We compared predictive performance (i.e. accuracy, data needs, interpretability) of GRAM to various methods including the recurrent neural network (RNN) in two sequential diagnoses prediction tasks and one heart failure prediction task. Compared to the basic RNN, GRAM achieved 10% higher accuracy for predicting diseases rarely observed in the training data and 3% improved area under the ROC curve for predicting heart failure using an order of magnitude less training data. Additionally, unlike other methods, the medical concept representations learned by GRAM are well aligned with the medical ontology. Finally, GRAM exhibits intuitive attention behaviors by adaptively generalizing to higher level concepts when facing data insufficiency at the lower level concepts. "
"The transport behavior and superconducting transition temperature Tc of NdFe1-yRuyAsO0.89F0.11 have been studied for various y values. Because Ru impurities are isoelectronic to host Fe atoms, we basically expect that the number of electrons does not change with y, at least in the region of small y values. The results indicate that the rate of Tc suppression by Ru atoms is too small to be explained by the pair breaking effect of nonmagnetic impurities expected for the S+- symmetry, confirming our previous results for Co doping.

"The Unified Modeling Language (UML) community has started to define so-called profiles in order to better suit the needs of specific domains or settings. Product lines1 represent a special breed of systems they are extensible semi-finished pieces of software. Completing the semi-finished software leads to various software pieces, typically specific applications, which share the same core. Though product lines have been developed for a wide range of domains, they apply common construction principles. The intention of the UML-F profile (for framework architectures) is the definition of a UML subset, enriched with a few UML-compliant extensions, which allows the annotation of such artifacts. This paper presents aspects of the profile with a focus on patterns and exemplifies the profile's usage. "
"Recent analyses suggest that distance residuals measured from Type Ia supernovae (SNe Ia) are correlated with local host galaxy properties within a few kpc of the SN explosion. However, the well-established correlation with global host galaxy properties is nearly as significant, with a shift of 0.06 mag across a low to high mass boundary (the mass step). Here, with 273 SNe Ia at $z<0.1$, we investigate whether stellar masses and rest-frame $u-g$ colors of regions within 1.5 kpc of the SN Ia explosion site are significantly better correlated with SN distance measurements than global properties or properties measured at random locations in SN hosts. At $\lesssim2\sigma$ significance, local properties tend to correlate with distance residuals better than properties at random locations, though despite using the largest low-$z$ sample to date we cannot definitively prove that a local correlation is more significant than a random correlation. Our data hint that SNe observed by surveys that do not target a pre-selected set of galaxies may have a larger local mass step than SNe from surveys that do, an increase of $0.071\pm0.036$ mag (2.0$\sigma$). We find a $3\sigma$ local mass step after global mass correction, evidence that SNe Ia should be corrected for their local mass, but we note that this effect is insignificant in the targeted low-$z$ sample. Only the local mass step remains significant at $>2\sigma$ after global mass correction, and we conservatively estimate a systematic shift in H$_0$ measurements of -0.14 $\textrm{km}\,\textrm{s}^{-1}\textrm{Mpc}^{-1}$ with an additional uncertainty of 0.14 $\textrm{km}\,\textrm{s}^{-1}\textrm{Mpc}^{-1}$, $\sim$10\% of the present uncertainty. "
"An analysis of the literature shows that there are two types of non-memristive models that have been widely used in the modeling of so-called ""memristive"" neural networks. Here, we demonstrate that such models have nothing in common with the concept of memristive elements: they describe either non-linear resistors or certain bi-state systems, which all are devices without memory. Therefore, the results presented in a significant number of publications are at least questionable, if not completely irrelevant to the actual field of memristive neural networks. "
"Under high pressures, phase transition, as well as deformation twins, are constantly reported in many BCC metals, whose interactions are of fundamental importance to understand strengthen mechanism of these metals under extreme conditions. However, the interactions between twins and phase transition in BCC metals are remain largely unexplored. In this work, interactions between coherent twin boundaries and $\alpha \to \epsilon$ phase transition of iron are investigated using both non- equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations and nudge elastic band method. Mechanisms of both twin-assisted phase transition and reverse phase transition are studied and orientation relationships between BCC and HCP phase are found to be <11-1>BCC || <-12-10>HCP and <1-10>BCC || <0001>HCP for both cases. The twin boundary corresponds to after the phase transition. It is amazing that the reverse transition seems to be able to ""memory"" and recover the initial BCC twins. The memory would partly loss when plastic slips take place in the HCP phase before the reverse transition. In the recovered initial BCC twins, three major twin spacing are observed, which are well explained in terms of energy barriers of the transition from HCP phase to BCC twin. Besides, variant selection rule of the twin assisted phase transition is also discussed. The results of present work could be expected to give some clues for producing ultra-fine grain structure in materials exhibiting martensitic phase transition. "
"Assignment markets involve matching with transfers, as in labor markets and housing markets. We consider a two-sided assignment market with agent types and stochastic structure similar to models used in empirical studies, and characterize the size of the core in such markets. Each agent has a randomly drawn productivity with respect to each type of agent on the other side. The value generated from a match between a pair of agents is the sum of the two productivity terms, each of which depends only on the type but not the identity of one of the agents, and a third deterministic term driven by the pair of types. We allow the number of agents to grow, keeping the number of agent types fixed. Let $n$ be the number of agents and $K$ be the number of types on the side of the market with more types. We find, under reasonable assumptions, that the relative variation in utility per agent over core outcomes is bounded as $O^*(1/n^{1/K})$, where polylogarithmic factors have been suppressed. Further, we show that this bound is tight in worst case. We also provide a tighter bound under more restrictive assumptions. Our results provide partial justification for the typical assumption of a unique core outcome in empirical studies. "
"We report a first principles, self-consistent, all electron, linear combination of Gaussian orbitals (LCGO) calculation of a comprehensive collection of magneto-optical properties of nickel and iron based on density functional theory. Among the many magneto-optical effects, we have studied the equatorial Kerr effect for absorption in the optical as well as soft X-ray region, where it is called X-ray magnetic linear dichroism (X-MLD). In the optical region the effect is of the order of 2\% while in the X-ray region it is of the order of 1\% for the incident angles considered. In addition, the polar Kerr effect, X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (X-MCD) and total X-ray absorption at the L$_{2,3}$ edges, soft X-ray Faraday effect at the L$_{2,3}$ edges have also been calculated. Our results are in good agreement with experiments and other first principles methods that have been used to calculate some of these properties. "
"We introduce the notion of a $\textit{reflection fusion category}$, which is a type of a $G$-crossed category generated by objects of Frobenius-Perron dimension $1$ and $\sqrt{p}$, where $p$ is an odd prime. We show that such categories correspond to orthogonal reflection groups over $\mathbb{F}_p$. This allows us to use the known classification of irreducible reflection groups over finite fields to classify irreducible reflection fusion categories. "
"We consider gauge coupling unification in E6 F-Theory Grand Unified Theories (GUTs) where E6 is broken to the Standard Model (SM) gauge group using fluxes. In such models there are two types of exotics that can affect gauge coupling unification, namely matter exotics from the matter curves in the 27 dimensional representation of E6 and the bulk exotics from the adjoint 78 dimensional representation of E6. We explore the conditions required for either the complete or partial removal of bulk exotics from the low energy spectrum. In the latter case we shall show that (miraculously) gauge coupling unification may be possible even if there are bulk exotics at the TeV scale. Indeed in some cases it is necessary for bulk exotics to survive to the TeV scale in order to cancel the effects coming from other TeV scale matter exotics which would by themselves spoil gauge coupling unification. The combination of matter and bulk exotics in these cases can lead to precise gauge coupling unification which would not be possible with either type of exotics considered by themselves. The combination of matter and bulk exotics at the TeV scale represents a unique and striking signature of E6 F-theory GUTs that can be tested at the LHC. "
"For the analytic function f(z), H. Shiraishi and S. Owa (Stud. Univ. Babes-Bolyai Math. 55(2010), 207-211) have shown a theorem for the minimum value of |f(z)|. In this paper, we discuss an application of this theorem and some corollaries. "
"Research on data confidentiality, integrity and availability is gaining momentum in the ICT community, due to the intrinsically insecure nature of the Internet. While many distributed systems and services are now based on secure communication protocols to avoid eavesdropping and protect confidentiality, the techniques usually employed in distributed simulations do not consider these issues at all. This is probably due to the fact that many real-world simulators rely on monolithic, offline approaches and therefore the issues above do not apply. However, the complexity of the systems to be simulated, and the rise of distributed and cloud based simulation, now impose the adoption of secure simulation architectures. This paper presents a solution to ensure both anonymity and confidentiality in distributed simulations. A performance evaluation based on an anonymized distributed simulator is used for quantifying the performance penalty for being anonymous. The obtained results show that this is a viable solution. "
"We present new Stromgren and Washington data sets for the Bootes I dwarf galaxy, and combine them with the available SDSS photometry. The goal of this project is to refine a ground-based, practical, accurate method to determine age and metallicity for individual stars in Bootes I that can be selected in an unbiased imaging survey, without having to take spectra. We produce photometric metallicities from Stromgren and Washington photometry, for stellar systems with a range of $-1.0>[Fe/H]>-3.5$. To avoid the decrease in sensitivity of the Stromgren metallicity index on the lower red-giant branch, we replace the Stromgren v-filter with the broader Washington C-filter; we find that $CT_1by$ is the most successful filter combination, for individual stars with $[Fe/H]<-2.0$, to maintain ~0.2 dex $[Fe/H]$-resolution over the whole red-giant branch. We demonstrate that we can break the isochrones' age-metallicity degeneracy with these filters, using stars with log g=2.5-3.0, which have less than a 2% change in their $(C-T_1)$-colour due to age, over a range of 11-14 Gyr. "
In this paper we generalize the results of arXiv:0806.4758 to non-zero value J of angular momentum in S^5. We compute the 1-loop correction to the energy of the folded spinning string in AdS_5 x S^5 in the particular limit of slow short string approximation. In this limit the string is moving in a near-flat central region of AdS_5 slowly rotating in both AdS_5 and S^5. The one-loop correction should represent the first subleading correction to strong coupling expansion of the anomalous dimension of short gauge theory operators of the form Tr D^S Z^J in the SL(2) sector.
"We construct a probabilistic quantum cloning machine by a general unitary-reduction operation. With a postselection of the measurement results, the machine yields faithful copies of the input states. It is shown that the states secretly chosen from a certain set $\$=\left\{\left| \Psi_1\right> ,\left| \Psi_2\right> ,... ,\left| \Psi_n\right> \right\} $ can be probabilistically cloned if and only if $% \left| \Psi_1\right>$, $\left| \Psi_2\right>$, $... ,$ and $\left| \Psi_n\right>$ are linearly-independent. We derive the best possible cloning efficiencies. Probabilistic cloning has close connection with the problem of identification of a set of states, which is a type of $n+1$ outcome measurement on $n$ linearly independent states. The optimal efficiencies for this type of measurement are obtained. "
"We introduce the notion of a graded integral element, prove the counterpart of the lying-over theorem on commutative algebra in the context of left commutative rngs, and use the Hu-Liu product to select a class of noncommutative rings. "
"Time-Reversal-Invariance non-conservation has now been unequivocally demonstrated in a direct measurement at CPLEAR. What about tests of time-reversal-invariance in systems other than the kaon system? Tests of time-reversal-invariance belong to two classes: searches for parity violating (P-odd)/time-reversal-invariance-odd (T-odd) interactions, and for P-even/T-odd interactions (assuming CPT conservation this implies C-conjugation non-conservation). Limits on a P-odd/T-odd interaction follow from measurements of the electric dipole moment of the neutron (with a present upper limit of 6 x 10^-26 e.cm [95% C.L.]). It provides a limit on a P-odd/T-odd pion-nucleon coupling constant which is less than 10^-4 times the weak interaction strength. Experimental limits on a P-even/T-odd interaction are much less stringent. Following the standard approach of describing the nucleon-nucleon interaction in terms of meson exchanges, it can be shown that only charged rho-meson exchange and A_1 meson exchange can lead to a P-even/T-odd interaction. The better constraints stem from measurements of the electric dipole moment of the neutron and from measurements of charge-symmetry breaking in neutron-proton elastic scattering. The latter experiments were executed at TRIUMF (497 and 347 MeV) and at IUCF (183 MeV). Weak decay experiments may provide limits which will possibly be comparable. All other experiments, like gamma decay experiments, detailed balance experiments, polarization - analyzing power difference determinations, and five-fold correlation experiments with polarized incident nucleons and aligned nuclear targets, have been shown to be at least an order of magnitude less sensitive. "
"The parton yield, (pseudo)rapidity distribution, and transverse momentum distribution in partonic matter assumed forming in the early stage of $pp$ and nucleus-nucleus collisions at RHIC energy ($\sqrt{s_{{NN}}}$=200 GeV) and LHC energy ($\sqrt{s_{{NN}}}$=5.5 TeV for nucleus-nucleus, 5.5 and/or 14 TeV for $pp$) are comparatively investigated with parton and hadron cascade model PACIAE. It turned out that the different parton and anti-parton spectra approach to be similar with reaction energy increasing from RHIC to LHC. We have argued that if the partonic matter forming in Au+Au collisions at RHIC energy is strongly interacting quark-gluon plasma, the one forming in Pb+Pb collisions at LHC energy might approach the real (free) quark-gluon plasma. "
"We analytically prove that the existence of the delta-function singularity in the chirally-odd twist-3 distribution $e(x)$ of the nucleon is inseparably connected with the nonvanishing quark condensate as a signal of the spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking of the QCD vacuum. This singularity in $e(x)$, which would be observed as a sizable violation of the 1st moment sum rule, is then interpreted as giving a very rare case that the nontrivial vacuum structure of QCD manifests in an observable of a localized QCD excitation, i.e. the nucleon. "
"We use heralded single photons to perform an antibunching experiment in which the clicks at the detectors are spacelike separated events. The idea of such experiment dates back to the 5th Solvay conference, when it was proposed by Einstein as an expression of his concerns about quantum theory. "
"The present paper scrutinizes the principle of quantum determinism, which maintains that the complete information about the initial quantum state of a physical system should determine the system's quantum state at any other time. As it shown in the paper, assuming the strong exponential time hypothesis, SETH, which conjectures that known algorithms for solving computational NP-complete problems (often brute-force algorithms) are optimal, the quantum deterministic principle cannot be used generally, i.e., for randomly selected physical systems, particularly macroscopic systems. In other words, even if the initial quantum state of an arbitrary system were precisely known, as long as SETH is true it might be impossible in the real world to predict the system's exact final quantum state. The paper suggests that the breakdown of quantum determinism in a process, in which a black hole forms and then completely evaporates, might actually be physical evidence supporting SETH. "
H. X. Yi's construction of unique range sets for entire functions is translated to the number theory setting to illustrate that his construction would work in the number theory setting if one knew a version of Schmidt's Subspace Theorem with truncated counting functions.
"We consider systems of interacting Generalized Friedman's Urns (GFUs) having irreducible mean replacement matrices. The interaction is modeled through the probability to sample the colors from each urn, that is defined as convex combination of the urn proportions in the system. From the weights of these combinations we individuate subsystems of urns evolving with different behaviors. We provide a complete description of the asymptotic properties of urn proportions in each subsystem by establishing limiting proportions, convergence rates and Central Limit Theorems. The main proofs are based on a detailed eigenanalysis and stochastic approximation techniques. "
"Despite the increasing number of women graduating in mathematics, a systemic gender imbalance persists and is signified by a pronounced gender gap in the distribution of active researchers and professors. Especially at the level of university faculty, women mathematicians continue being drastically underrepresented, decades after the first affirmative action measures have been put into place. A solid publication record is of paramount importance for securing permanent positions. Thus, the question arises whether the publication patterns of men and women mathematicians differ in a significant way. Making use of the zbMATH database, one of the most comprehensive metadata sources on mathematical publications, we analyze the scholarly output of ~150,000 mathematicians from the past four decades whose gender we algorithmically inferred. We focus on development over time, collaboration through coautorships, presumed journal quality and distribution of research topics -- factors known to have a strong impact on job perspectives. We report significant differences between genders which may put women at a disadvantage when pursuing an academic career in mathematics. "
"We review and relate two recent complementary constructions of linear local gauge-invariant observables for cosmological perturbations in generic spatially flat single-field inflationary cosmologies. After briefly discussing their physical significance, we give explicit, covariant and mutually invertible transformations between the two sets of observables, thus resolving any doubts about their equivalence. In this way, we get a geometric interpretation and show the completeness of both sets of observables, while previously each of these properties was available only for one of them. "
"We study a generalization of the Navier-Stokes-Fourier system for an incompressible fluid where the deviatoric part of the Cauchy stress tensor is related to the symmetric part of the velocity gradient via a maximal monotone 2-graph that is continuously parametrized by the temperature. As such, the considered fluid may go through transitions between three of the following regimes: it can flow as a Bingham fluid for a specific value of the temperature, while it can behave as the Navier-Stokes fluid for another value of the temperature or, for yet another temperature, it can respond as the Euler fluid until a certain activation initiates the response of the Navier-Stokes fluid. At the same time, we regard a generalized threshold slip on the boundary that also may go through various regimes continuously with the temperature. All material coefficients like the dynamic viscosity, friction or activation coefficients are assumed to be temperature-dependent. We establish the large-data and long-time existence of weak solutions, applying the $L^{\infty}$-truncation technique to approximate the velocity field. "
"We discuss properties of root posets for finite crystallographic root systems, and show that these properties uniquely determine root posets for the noncrystallographic dihedral types and type $H_3$, while proving that there does not exist a poset satisfying all of the properties in type $H_4$. We do this by exhaustive computer searches for posets having these properties. We further give a realization of the poset of type $H_3$ as restricted roots of type $D_6$, and conjecture a Hilbert polynomial for the $q,t$-Catalan numbers for type $H_4$. "
"It is proposed that the baryons in gamma ray burst (GRB) fireballs originate as ""pick-up"" neutrons that leak in sideways from surrounding baryonic matter and convert to protons in a collision avalanche. The asymptotic Lorentz factor is estimated, and, in the absence of collimation, is shown to be angle dependent. Reasonable agreement is obtained with existing limits on the GRB baryonic component. The charged decay and collision products of the neutrons become ultrarelativistic immediately, and a UHE neutrino burst is produced with an efficiency that can exceed 0.5. Other signatures may include lithium, beryllium and/or boron lines in the supernova remnants associated with GRB's and high polarization of the gamma rays. "
"Compiler writers typically focus primarily on the performance of the generated program binaries when selecting the passes and the order in which they are applied in the standard optimization levels, such as GCC -O3. In some domains, such as embedded systems and High-Performance Computing (HPC), it might be sometimes acceptable to slowdown computations if the energy consumed can be significantly decreased. Embedded systems often rely on a battery and besides energy also have power dissipation limitations, while HPC centers have a growing concern with electricity and cooling costs. Relying on power policies to apply frequency/voltage scaling and/or change the CPU to idle states (e.g., alternate between power levels in bursts) as the main method to reduce energy leaves potential for improvement using other orthogonal approaches. In this work we evaluate the impact of compiler pass sequences specialization (also known as compiler phase ordering) as a means to reduce the energy consumed by a set of programs/functions when comparing with the use of the standard compiler phase orders provided by, e.g., -OX flags. We use our phase selection and ordering framework to explore the design space in the context of a Clang+LLVM compiler targeting a multicore ARM processor in an ODROID board and a dual x86 desktop representative of a node in a Supercomputing center. Our experiments with a set of representative kernels show that there we can reduce energy consumption by up to 24% and that some of these improvements can only be partially explained by improvements to execution time. The experiments show cases where applications that run faster consume more energy. Additionally, we make an effort to characterize the compiler sequence exploration space in terms of their impact on performance and energy. "
"Let D(n,p) be the random directed graph on n vertices where each of the n(n-1) possible arcs is present independently with probability p. A celebrated result of Frieze shows that if $p\ge(\log n+\omega(1))/n$ then D(n,p) typically has a directed Hamilton cycle, and this is best possible. In this paper, we obtain a strengthening of this result, showing that under the same condition, the number of directed Hamilton cycles in D(n,p) is typically $n!(p(1+o(1)))^{n}$. We also prove a hitting-time version of this statement, showing that in the random directed graph process, as soon as every vertex has in-/out-degrees at least 1, there are typically $n!(\log n/n(1+o(1)))^{n}$ directed Hamilton cycles. "
"We show the existence of geometric quotients for the spaces of certain classes of morphisms of sheaves on projective space, modulo the canonical action of the group of automorphisms. "
"Based on results obtained in a companion paper [MSRI preprint 1997-002], we construct groups of special $S$--units for function fields of characteristic $p>0$, and show that they satisfy Gras--type Conjectures. We use these results in order to give a new proof of Chinburg's $\Omega_3$--Conjecture on the Galois module structure of the group of $S$--units, for cyclic extensions of prime degree of function fields. "
We report on the status of the determination of the heavy quark masses from our calculation of the quarkonia spectra. All sources of systematic errors that enter the quark mass determination are accounted for. We explicitly keep $ma \neq 0$ in the perturbative calculation relating the bare lattice mass to a renormalized mass. Our results are still preliminary.
"The results for the elastic nucleon form factors and the electromagnetic transition amplitudes to the Delta(1232) resonance, obtained with the Hypercentral Constituent Quark Model with the inclusion of a meson cloud correction are briefly presented. The pion cloud effects are explicitly discussed. "
"Let q>1 denote an integer relatively prime to 2,3,7 and for which G=PSL(2,q) is a Hurwitz group for a smooth projective curve X defined over C. We compute the G-module structure of the Riemann-Roch space L(D), where D is an invariant divisor on X of positive degree. This depends on a computation of the ramification module, which we give explicitly. In particular, we obtain the decomposition of H^1(X,C) as a G-module. "
"In this paper we consider monic polynomials such that their coefficients coincide with their zeros. These polynomials were first introduced by S. Ulam. We combine methods of algebraic geometry and dynamical systems to prove several results. We obtain estimates on the number of Ulam polynomials of degree $N$. We provide additional methods to obtain algebraic identities satisfied by the zeros of Ulam polynomials, beyond the straightforward comparison of their zeros and coefficients. To address the question about existence of orthogonal Ulam polynomial sequences, we show that the only Ulam polynomial eigenfunctions of hypergeometric type differential operators are the trivial Ulam polynomials $\{x^N\}_{N=0}^\infty$. We propose a family of solvable $N$-body problems such that their stable equilibria are the zeros of certain Ulam polynomials. "
"We theoretically model the electronic dynamics of a coupled quantum dot pair in a static electric field. We then investigate the possibility of polarization-entangled photon emission from the radiative cascade of the molecular biexciton state. Through numerical simulations, we analyze the dependence of entanglement fidelity on temperature and electric field, as well as tunnel coupling. We establish a regime of direct-indirect exciton detunings for which coupled quantum dots are superior to single dots for entangled photon generation, yielding near-unit fidelity over a larger range of exchange splittings. "
"In this paper we introduce the semi-graded rings, which extend graded rings and skew PBW extensions. For this new type of non-commutative rings we will discuss some basic problems of non-commutative algebraic geometry. In particular, we will prove some elementary properties of the generalized Hilbert series, Hilbert polynomial and Gelfand-Kirillov dimension. We will extended the notion of non-commutative projective scheme to the case of semi-graded rings and we generalize the Serre-Artin-Zhang-Verevkin theorem. Some examples are included at the end of the paper. "
"A technical obstruction preventing the conclusion of nonlinear stability of large-Froude number roll waves of the St. Venant equations for inclined thin film flow is the ""slope condition"" of Johnson-Noble-Zumbrun, used to obtain pointwise symmetrizability of the linearized equations and thereby high-frequency resolvent bounds and a crucial H s nonlinear damping estimate. Numerically, this condition is seen to hold for Froude numbers 2 \textless{} F 3.5, but to fail for 3.5 F. As hydraulic engineering applications typically involve Froude number 3 F 5, this issue is indeed relevant to practical considerations. Here, we show that the pointwise slope condition can be replaced by an averaged version which holds always, thereby completing the nonlinear theory in the large-F case. The analysis has potentially larger interest as an extension to the periodic case of a type of weighted ""Kawashima-type"" damping estimate introduced in the asymptotically-constant coefficient case for the study of stability of large-amplitude viscous shock waves. "
"In this paper we discuss existing approaches for Bitcoin payments, as suitable for a small business for small-value transactions. We develop an evaluation framework utilizing security, usability, deployability criteria,, examine several existing systems, tools. Following a requirements engineering approach, we designed, implemented a new Point of Sale (PoS) system that satisfies an optimal set of criteria within our evaluation framework. Our open source system, Aunja PoS, has been deployed in a real world cafe since October 2014. "
"The climate change attribution problem is addressed using empirical decomposition. Cycles in solar motion and activity of 60 and 20 years were used to develop an empirical model of Earth temperature variations. The model was fit to the Hadley global temperature data up to 1950 (time period before anthropogenic emissions became the dominant forcing mechanism), and then extrapolated from 1951 to 2009. After subtraction of the model, the residuals showed an approximate linear upward trend after 1942. Herein we assume that the residual upward warming observed during the second half of the 20th century has been mostly induced by a worldwide rapid increase of anthropogenic emissions, urbanization and land use change. The warming observed before 1942 is relatively small and it is assumed to have been mostly naturally induced by a climatic recovery since the Little Ice Age of the 17th century and the Dalton Minimum at the beginning of the 19th century. The resulting full natural plus anthropogenic model fits the entire 160 year record very well. Residual analysis does not provide any evidence for a substantial cooling effect due to sulfate aerosols from 1940 to 1970. The cooling observed during that period may be due to a natural 60-year cycle, which is visible in the global temperature since 1850 and has been observed also in numerous multisecular climatic records. New solar activity proxy models are developed that suggest a mechanism for both the 60-year climate cycle and a portion of the long-term warming trend. Our results suggest that because current models underestimate the strength of natural multidecadal cycles in the temperature records, the anthropogenic contribution to climate change since 1970 should be around half of that previously claimed by the IPCC [2007]. A 21st Century forecast suggests that climate may warm less than 1^{\circ}C by 2100. "
"We evaluate the S-wave pion--nucleon scattering length $a^-$ in the framework of heavy baryon chiral perturbation theory up--to--and--including terms of order $M_\pi^4$. We show that the order $M_\pi^4$ piece of the isovector amplitude at threshold, $T^-_{\rm thr}$, vanishes exactly. We predict for the isovector scattering length, $0.088 \, M_{\pi^+}^{-1} \le a^- \le 0.096 \, M_{\pi^+}^{-1}$. "
"The formation of the first stars and quasars marks the transition between the smooth initial state and the clumpy current state of the Universe. In popular CDM cosmologies, the first sources of light started to form at a redshift z=30 and ionized most of the hydrogen in the Universe by z=8. Current observations are at the threshold of probing the reionization epoch. The study of high-redshift sources is likely to attract major attention in observational and theoretical cosmology over the next decade. "
"This paper investigates the effect of payload size on goodput for wireless networks where packets created from a message through a segmentation function are lost due to bit errors and they are recovered by a stop-and-wait protocol. To achieve this, we derive the exact analytical form of goodput using the analytical form of a packet-size distribution, given a message-size distribution and a payload size. In previous work, the packet sizes are assumed to be constant, which are payload size plus header size, although actual segmented packets are not constant in size. Hence, this constant packet-size assumption may be not justified for goodput analysis. From numerical results, we show that the constant packet-size assumption is not justified under low bit-error rates. Furthermore, we indicate that the curves of goodput are concave in payload size under high bit-error rates. In addition, we show that the larger mean bit-error burst length yields less concave curves of goodput. "
We show that the model of discrete spaces that we have proposed in previous contributions gives a comprehensive and detailed interpretation of the properties of the standard model of particles. Moreover the model also suggests the possible existence of a new family of particles.
"In this book, we consider various many-valued logics: standard, linear, hyperbolic, parabolic, non-Archimedean, p-adic, interval, neutrosophic, etc. We survey also results which show the tree different proof-theoretic frameworks for many-valued logics, e.g. frameworks of the following deductive calculi: Hilbert's style, sequent, and hypersequent. We present a general way that allows to construct systematically analytic calculi for a large family of non-Archimedean many-valued logics: hyperrational-valued, hyperreal-valued, and p-adic valued logics characterized by a special format of semantics with an appropriate rejection of Archimedes' axiom. These logics are built as different extensions of standard many-valued logics (namely, Lukasiewicz's, Goedel's, Product, and Post's logics). The informal sense of Archimedes' axiom is that anything can be measured by a ruler. Also logical multiple-validity without Archimedes' axiom consists in that the set of truth values is infinite and it is not well-founded and well-ordered. On the base of non-Archimedean valued logics, we construct non-Archimedean valued interval neutrosophic logic INL by which we can describe neutrality phenomena. "
"This work extends the concepts of algebraic flux correction and convex limiting to continuous high-order Bernstein finite element discretizations of scalar hyperbolic problems. Using an array of adjustable diffusive fluxes, the standard Galerkin approximation is transformed into a nonlinear high-resolution scheme which has the compact sparsity pattern of the piecewise-linear or multilinear subcell discretization. The representation of this scheme in terms of invariant domain preserving states makes it possible to prove the validity of local discrete maximum principles under CFL-like conditions. In contrast to predictor-corrector approaches based on the flux-corrected transport methodology, the proposed flux limiting strategy is monolithic; i.e., limited antidiffusive terms are incorporated into the well-defined residual of a nonlinear (semi-)discrete problem. A stabilized high-order Galerkin discretization is recovered if no limiting is performed. In the limited version, the compact stencil property prevents direct mass exchange between nodes that are not nearest neighbors. A formal proof of sparsity is provided for simplicial and box elements. The involved element contributions can be calculated efficiently making use of matrix-free algorithms and precomputed element matrices of the reference element. Numerical studies for $\mathbb{Q}_2$ discretizations of linear and nonlinear two-dimensional test problems illustrate the virtues of monolithic convex limiting based on subcell flux decompositions. "
"When the standard model is viewed as a low energy effective theory, the neutrinos can obtain mass from higher dimensional operators. It has been known for long that such an operator first appears at mass dimension five and that it is unique. Here we show that the effective neutrino mass operator at every higher dimension is unique. This general claim is established using Young tableau, and illustrated by exhausting all potentially different operators at dimension seven. The result is relevant to the search of new physics effects beyond neutrino mass that can arise at a relatively low energy scale. "
"In this paper, we describe an IDE called CAPS (Calculational Assistant for Programming from Specifications) for the interactive, calculational derivation of imperative programs. In building CAPS, our aim has been to make the IDE accessible to non-experts while retaining the overall flavor of the pen-and-paper calculational style. We discuss the overall architecture of the CAPS system, the main features of the IDE, the GUI design, and the trade-offs involved. "
"A well-known class of questions asks the following: If $X$ and $Y$ are metric measure spaces and $f:X\rightarrow Y$ is a Lipschitz mapping whose image has positive measure, then must $f$ have large pieces on which it is bi-Lipschitz? Building on methods of David (who is not the present author) and Semmes, we answer this question in the affirmative for Lipschitz mappings between certain types of Ahlfors $s$-regular, topological $d$-manifolds. In general, these manifolds need not be bi-Lipschitz embeddable in any Euclidean space. To prove the result, we use some facts on the Gromov-Hausdorff convergence of manifolds and a topological theorem of Bonk and Kleiner. This also yields a new proof of the uniform rectifiability of some metric manifolds. "
"The $\eta_6$, a ``heavy axion'' associated with sextet quark electroweak symmetry breaking, may have been seen at LEP via its two-photon decay mode and also at TRISTAN via its hadronic decay modes. - presented at DPF 92. "
"We calculate the $O(a)$ improvement coefficient c_SW in the Sheikholeslami-Wohlert quark action for various improved gauge actions with six-link loops. We employ the conventional perturbation theory introducing the fictitious gluon mass to regularize the infrared divergence. Our results for some improved gauge actions are in agreement with those previously obtained with the Schr{\""o}dinger functional method. "
"FASTEST-3D is an MPI-parallel finite-volume flow solver based on block-structured meshes that has been developed at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg since the early 1990s. It can be used to solve the laminar or turbulent incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. Up to now its scalability was strongly limited by a rather rigid communication infrastructure, which led to a dominance of MPI time already at small process counts. This paper describes several optimizations to increase the performance, scalability, and flexibility of FASTEST-3D. First, a node-level performance analysis is carried out in order to pinpoint the main bottlenecks and identify sweet spots for energy-efficient execution. In addition, a single-precision version of the solver for the linear equation system arising from the discretization of the governing equations is devised, which significantly increases the single-core performance. Then the communication mechanisms in FASTEST-3D are analyzed and a new communication strategy based on non-blocking calls is implemented. Performance results with the revised version show significantly increased single-node performance and considerably improved communication patterns along with much better parallel scalability. In this context we discuss the concept of ""acceptable parallel efficiency"" and how it influences the real gain of the optimizations. Scaling measurements are carried out on a modern petascale system. The obtained improvements are of major importance for the use of FASTEST-3D on current high-performance computer clusters and will help to perform simulations with much higher spatial and temporal resolution to tackle turbulent flow in technical applications. "
"In this paper, we re-investigate the resolution of Toeplitz systems $T u =g$, from a new point of view, by correlating the solution of such problems with syzygies of polynomials or moving lines. We show an explicit connection between the generators of a Toeplitz matrix and the generators of the corresponding module of syzygies. We show that this module is generated by two elements of degree $n$ and the solution of $T u=g$ can be reinterpreted as the remainder of an explicit vector depending on $g$, by these two generators. "
"In this work, we focus on the analysis of a CME-driven shock observed by SOHO/LASCO. We show that white-light coronagraphic images can be employed to estimate the compression ratio X = rho_d / rho_u all along the front of CME-driven shocks. X increases from the shock flanks (where X ~ 1.2) to the shock center (where X ~ 3.0 is maximum). From the estimated X values, we infer the Alfv\'en Mach number for the general case of an oblique shock. It turns out that only a small region around the shock center is supercritical at earlier times, while higher up in the corona the whole shock becomes subcritical. This suggests that CME-driven shocks could be efficient particle accelerators at the initiation phases of the event, while at later times they progressively loose energy, also losing their capability to accelerate high energy particles. This result has important implications on the localization of particle acceleration sites and in the context of predictive space weather studies. "
"We show that the epoch(s) of reionization when the ionization fraction of the universe is about half can be determined by correlating Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) temperature maps with 21-cm line maps at degree scales ($l\sim 100$). During reionization peculiar motion of free electrons induces the Doppler anisotropy of the CMB, while density fluctuations of neutral hydrogen induce the 21-cm line anisotropy. In our simplified model of inhomogeneous reionization, a positive correlation arises as the universe reionizes whereas a negative correlation arises as it recombines; thus, the sign of the correlation provides information on the reionization history which cannot be obtained by presently. The signal comes mainly from large scales (k~0.01 Mpc^-1) where linear perturbation theory is valid and complexity due to patchy reionization is averaged out. Since the Doppler signal comes from ionized regions and the 21-cm comes from neutral ones, the correlation has a well-defined peak(s) in redshift when the ionization fraction of the universe is about half. Furthermore, the cross-correlation is much less sensitive to systematic errors, especially foreground emission, than the auto-correlation of 21-cm lines: this is analogous to the temperature-polarization correlation of the CMB being more immune to systematic errors than the polarization-polarization. Therefore, we argue that the Doppler-21cm correlation provides a robust measurement of the 21-cm anisotropy, which can also be used as a diagnostic tool for detected signals in the 21-cm data -- detection of the cross-correlation provides the strongest confirmation that the signal is of cosmological origin. We show that the Square Kilometer Array can easily measure the predicted correlation signal for 1~year of survey observation. "
"We study the structures of hybrid stars with leptons at finite temperature under beta equilibrium. For the quark phase, we use the three flavor Nambu-Jona-Lasinio (NJL) model. For the hadron phase, we adopt nuclear equation of state (EOS) by Shen et al.. This EOS is in the framework of the relativistic mean field theory including the tree body effects. For the hadron-quark phase transition, we impose the bulk Gibbs construction or the Maxwell construction to take into account uncertainties by {\it finite size effects}. We find that the pure quark phase does not appear in stable star cores in all cases. With the phase transition, the maximum masses increase $\sim 10 %$ for high lepton fraction. On the contrary, without the transition, they decrease $\sim 10 %$. We also find that, in the NJL model, the lepton fraction is more important for structures of unstable stars than the temperature. This result is important for many astrophysical phenomena such as the core collapse of massive stars. "
"The Erd\H{o}s--Hajnal Theorem asserts that non-universal graphs, that is, graphs that do not contain an induced copy of some fixed graph $H$, have homogeneous sets of size significantly larger than one can generally expect to find in a graph. We obtain two results of this flavor in the setting of $r$-uniform hypergraphs. A theorem of R\""odl asserts that if an $n$-vertex graph is non-universal then it contains an almost homogeneous set (i.e one with edge density either very close to $0$ or $1$) of size $\Omega(n)$. We prove that if a $3$-uniform hypergraph is non-universal then it contains an almost homogeneous set of size $\Omega(\log n)$. An example of R\""odl from 1986 shows that this bound is tight. Let $R_r(t)$ denote the size of the largest non-universal $r$-graph $G$ so that neither $G$ nor its complement contain a complete $r$-partite subgraph with parts of size $t$. We prove an Erd\H{o}s--Hajnal-type stepping-up lemma, showing how to transform a lower bound for $R_{r}(t)$ into a lower bound for $R_{r+1}(t)$. As an application of this lemma, we improve a bound of Conlon--Fox--Sudakov by showing that $R_3(t) \geq t^{\Omega(t)}$. "
"We present a state-of-the-art linear redshift distortion analysis of the recently published IRAS Point Source Catalog Redshift Survey (PSCz). The procedure involves linear compression into 4096 Karhunen-Loeve modes culled from a potential pool of about 3 x 10^5 modes, followed by quadratic compression into three separate power spectra, the galaxy-galaxy, galaxy-velocity, and velocity-velocity power spectra. Least squares fitting to the decorrelated power spectra yields a linear redshift distortion parameter beta = Omega_m^0.6/b = 0.41(+0.13,-0.12). "
"Recent work by Castro, Granik and El Naschie has given a rationale for the three dimensionality of our physical space within the framework of cantorian fractal space time using similar ideas of quantized fractal space time and noncommutativity. We also deduce the same result. Interestingly this is also seen to provide a rationale for an unproven conjecture of Poincare. "
"We perform an Alcock-Paczynski test using stacked cosmic voids identified in the SDSS Data Release 7 main sample and Data Release 10 LOWZ and CMASS samples. We find ~1,500 voids out to redshift $0.6$ using a heavily modified and extended version of the watershed algorithm ZOBOV, which we call VIDE (Void IDentification and Examination). To assess the impact of peculiar velocities we use the mock void catalogs presented in Sutter et al. (2013). We find a constant uniform flattening of 14% along the line of sight when peculiar velocities are included. This flattening appears universal for all void sizes at all redshifts and for all tracer densities. We also use these mocks to identify an optimal stacking strategy. After correcting for systematic effects we find that our Alcock-Paczynski measurement leads to a preference of our best-fit value of $\Omega_{\rm M}\sim 0.15$ over $\Omega_{\rm M} = 1.0$ by a likelihood ratio of 10. Likewise, we find a factor of $4.5$ preference of the likelihood ratio for a $\Lambda$CDM $\Omega_{\rm M} = 0.3$ model and a null measurement. Taken together, we find substantial evidence for the Alcock-Paczynski signal in our sample of cosmic voids. Our assessment using realistic mocks suggests that measurements with future SDSS releases and other surveys will provide tighter cosmological parameter constraints. The void-finding algorithm and catalogs used in this work will be made publicly available at http://www.cosmicvoids.net. "
"In this paper, we present a simple and parameter-efficient drop-in module for one-stage object detectors like SSD when learning from scratch (i.e., without pre-trained models). We call our module GFR (Gated Feature Reuse), which exhibits two main advantages. First, we introduce a novel gate-controlled prediction strategy enabled by Squeeze-and-Excitation to adaptively enhance or attenuate supervision at different scales based on the input object size. As a result, our model is more effective in detecting diverse sizes of objects. Second, we propose a feature-pyramids structure to squeeze rich spatial and semantic features into a single prediction layer, which strengthens feature representation and reduces the number of parameters to learn. We apply the proposed structure on DSOD and SSD detection frameworks, and evaluate the performance on PASCAL VOC 2007, 2012 and COCO datasets. With fewer model parameters, GFR-DSOD outperforms the baseline DSOD by 1.4%, 1.1%, 1.7% and 0.6%, respectively. GFR-SSD also outperforms the original SSD and SSD with dense prediction by 3.6% and 2.8% on VOC 2007 dataset. Code is available at: https://github.com/szq0214/GFR-DSOD . "
"To enjoy more social network services, users nowadays are usually involved in multiple online social networks simultaneously. The shared users between different networks are called anchor users, while the remaining unshared users are named as non-anchor users. Connections between accounts of anchor users in different networks are defined as anchor links and networks partially aligned by anchor links can be represented as partially aligned networks. In this paper, we want to predict anchor links between partially aligned social networks, which is formally defined as the partial network alignment problem. The partial network alignment problem is very difficult to solve because of the following two challenges: (1) the lack of general features for anchor links, and (2) the ""one-to-one$_\le$"" (one to at most one) constraint on anchor links. To address these two challenges, a new method PNA (Partial Network Aligner) is proposed in this paper. PNA (1) extracts a set of explicit anchor adjacency features and latent topological features for anchor links based on the anchor meta path concept and tensor decomposition techniques, and (2) utilizes the generic stable matching to identify the non-anchor users to prune the redundant anchor links attached to them. Extensive experiments conducted on two real-world partially aligned social networks demonstrate that PNA can solve the partial network alignment problem very well and outperform all the other comparison methods with significant advantages.

"We develop an elementary algebraic method to compute the center of the principal block of a small quantum group associated with a complex semisimple Lie algebra at a root of unity. The exemplary case of $\mathfrak{sl}_3$ is computed explicitly, and further evidence of $\mathfrak{sl}_4$ is sketched. This allows us to formulate the conjecture that, as a bigraded vector space, the center of a regular block of the small quantum $\mathfrak{sl}_m$ at a root of unity is isomorphic to Haiman's diagonal coinvariant algebra for the symmetric group $S_{m}$. "
"Complex biological and physical transport processes are often described through systems of interacting particles. Excluded-volume effects on these transport processes are well studied, however the interplay between volume exclusion and reactions between heterogenous particles is less well known. In this paper we develop a novel framework for modeling reaction-diffusion processes which directly incorporates volume exclusion. From an off-lattice microscopic individual based model we use the Fokker--Planck equation and the method of matched asymptotic expansions to derive a low-dimensional macroscopic system of nonlinear partial differential equations describing the evolution of the particles. A biologically motivated, hybrid model of chemotaxis with volume exclusion is explored, where reactions occur at rates dependent upon the chemotactic environment. Further, we show that for reactions due to contact interactions the appropriate reaction term in the macroscopic model is of lower order in the asymptotic expansion than the nonlinear diffusion term. However, we find that the next reaction term in the expansion is needed to ensure good agreement with simulations of the microscopic model. Our macroscopic model allows for more direct parameterization to experimental data than the models available to date. "
"Radiative transfer modelling of AGB circumstellar envelopes is applied to a sample of AGB stars previously observed with the mid-IR imaging camera TIRCAM (Busso et al. 1996: Paper I). We present the results of our simulations, aimed at deriving the physical parameters of the envelope, such as the optical depth and the radial thermal structure, the mass loss and the dust-to-gas mass ratio. The chemical composition of the dust in the observed envelopes is discussed. The ability of different sets of dust opacities to fit the mid-infrared spectra is evaluated. The hypothesis of dust grain aging and annealing in O-rich envelopes is considered in order to explain an apparent inadequacy of the availabe opacities to describe the variety of observed spectra, as previously noted by other authors. Various possible origins of the discrepancies are discussed, together with their consequences on the dust grain formation processes. "
"Over the past decade there has been considerable interest in spectral algorithms for learning Predictive State Representations (PSRs). Spectral algorithms have appealing theoretical guarantees; however, the resulting models do not always perform well on inference tasks in practice. One reason for this behavior is the mismatch between the intended task (accurate filtering or prediction) and the loss function being optimized by the algorithm (estimation error in model parameters). A natural idea is to improve performance by refining PSRs using an algorithm such as EM. Unfortunately it is not obvious how to apply apply an EM style algorithm in the context of PSRs as the Log Likelihood is not well defined for all PSRs. We show that it is possible to overcome this problem using ideas from Predictive State Inference Machines. We combine spectral algorithms for PSRs as a consistent and efficient initialization with PSIM-style updates to refine the resulting model parameters. By combining these two ideas we develop Inference Gradients, a simple, fast, and robust method for practical learning of PSRs. Inference Gradients performs gradient descent in the PSR parameter space to optimize an inference-based loss function like PSIM. Because Inference Gradients uses a spectral initialization we get the same consistency benefits as PSRs. We show that Inference Gradients outperforms both PSRs and PSIMs on real and synthetic data sets. "
"The anisotropy of the speed of light at 1 part in 10^3 has been detected by Michelson and Morley (1887), Miller (1925/26), Illingworth (1927), Joos (1930), Jaseja et al. (1964), Torr and Kolen (1984), De Witte (1991) and Cahill (2006) using a variety of experimental techniques, from gas-mode Michelson interferometers (with the relativistic theory for these only determined in 2002) to one-way RF coaxial cable propagation timing. All agree on the speed, right ascension and declination of the anisotropy velocity. The Stephan Marinov experiment (1984) detected a light speed anisotropy using a mechanical coupled shutters technique which has holes in co-rotating disks, essentially a one-way version of the Fizeau mechanical round-trip speed-of-light experiment. The Marinov data is re-analysed herein because the velocity vector he determined is in a very different direction to that from the above experiments. No explanation for this difference has been uncovered. "
"We analyze the interplay between a d-wave uniform superconducting and a pair-density-wave (PDW) order parameter in the neighborhood of a vortex. We develop a phenomenological nonlinear sigma-model, solve the saddle point equation for the order parameter configuration, and compute the resulting local density of states in the vortex halo. The intertwining of the two superconducting orders leads to a charge density modulation with the same periodicity as the PDW, which is twice the period of the charge-density-wave that arises as a second-harmonic of the PDW itself. We discuss key features of the charge density modulation that can be directly compared with recent results from scanning tunneling microscopy and speculate on the role PDW order may play in the global phase diagram of the hole-doped cuprates. "
"In this paper we show that information on both the differential and common mode free-mass response to a gravitational wave can provide important information on discriminating the direction of the gravitational wave source and between different theories of gravitation. The conventional Michelson interferometer scheme only measures the differential free-mass response. By changing the orientation of the beam splitter, it is possible to configure the detector so it is sensitive to the common-mode of the free-mass motion. The proposed interferometer is an adaptation of the Fox-Smith interferometer. A major limitation to the new scheme is its enhanced sensitivity to laser frequency fluctuations over the conventional, and we propose a method of canceling these fluctuations. The configuration could be used in parallel to the conventional differential detection scheme with a significant sensitivity and bandwidth. "
"In this paper we obtain an explicit formula for the number of degree d curves in two dimensional complex projective space, passing through (d(d+3)/2 -k) generic points and having a codimension k singularity, where k is at most 7. In the past, many of these numbers were computed using techniques from algebraic geometry. In this paper we use purely topological methods to count curves. Our main tool is a classical fact from differential topology: the number of zeros of a generic smooth section of a vector bundle V over M, counted with a sign, is the Euler class of V evaluated on the fundamental class of M. "
"A special feature of the ground state in a topologically ordered phase is the existence of large scale correlations depending only on the topology of the regions. These correlations can be detected by the topological entanglement entropy or by a measure called irreducible correlation. We show that these two measures coincide for states obeying an area law and having zero-correlation length. Moreover, we provide an operational meaning for these measures by proving its equivalence to the optimal rate of a particular class of secret sharing protocols. This establishes an information-theoretical approach to multipartite correlations in topologically ordered systems. "
"The ability of a reinforcement learning (RL) agent to learn about many reward functions at the same time has many potential benefits, such as the decomposition of complex tasks into simpler ones, the exchange of information between tasks, and the reuse of skills. We focus on one aspect in particular, namely the ability to generalise to unseen tasks. Parametric generalisation relies on the interpolation power of a function approximator that is given the task description as input; one of its most common form are universal value function approximators (UVFAs). Another way to generalise to new tasks is to exploit structure in the RL problem itself. Generalised policy improvement (GPI) combines solutions of previous tasks into a policy for the unseen task; this relies on instantaneous policy evaluation of old policies under the new reward function, which is made possible through successor features (SFs). Our proposed universal successor features approximators (USFAs) combine the advantages of all of these, namely the scalability of UVFAs, the instant inference of SFs, and the strong generalisation of GPI. We discuss the challenges involved in training a USFA, its generalisation properties and demonstrate its practical benefits and transfer abilities on a large-scale domain in which the agent has to navigate in a first-person perspective three-dimensional environment. "
"The Reidemeister torsion construction can be applied to the chain complex used to compute the Khovanov homology of a knot or a link. This defines a volume form on Khovanov homology. The volume form transforms correctly under Reidemeister moves to give an invariant volume on the Khovanov homology. In this paper, its construction and invariance under these moves is demonstrated. Also, some examples of the invariant are presented for particular choices for the bases of homology groups to obtain a numerical invariant of knots and links. In these examples, the algebraic torsion seen in the Khovanov chain complex when homology is computed over $\mathbb{Z}$ is recovered. "
The real time exponential decay laws for meta-stable charged particles are shown to require radiative corrections. The methods employed are well known to be valid for radiatively correcting Breit-Wigner line shapes. Radiative corrections contribute substantially to precision life time measurements of muons and pions when initially stopped in condensed matter.
"In this survey article we describe some geometric results in the theory of noncommutative rings and, more generally, in the theory of abelian categories. Roughly speaking and by analogy with the commutative situation, the category of graded modules modulo torsion over a noncommutative graded ring of quadratic, respectively cubic growth should be thought of as the noncommutative analogue of a projective curve, respectively surface. This intuition has lead to a remarkable number of nontrivial insights and results in noncommutative algebra. Indeed, the problem of classifying noncommutative curves (and noncommutative graded rings of quadratic growth) can be regarded as settled. Despite the fact that no classification of noncommutative surfaces is in sight, a rich body of nontrivial examples and techniques, including blowing up and down, has been developed. "
"New and complete multi-band light curves of the oEA stars QY Aql, BW Del, TZ Dra, BO Her and RR Lep were obtained and analysed with the Wilson-Devinney code. The light curves residuals were further analysed with the Fourier method in order to derive the pulsation characteristics of the oscillating components. All the reliable observed times of minimum light were used to examine orbital period irregularities. The orbital period analyses revealed secular changes for QY Aql and BW Del, while the Light-Time Effect seems to be the best explanation for the cyclic period changes in TZ Dra and BO Her. RR Lep has a rather steady orbital period. Light curve solutions provided the means to calculate the absolute parameters of the components of the systems, which subsequently were used to make an estimate of their present evolutionary status. "
"An analogue of the Cauchy problem for the iterated multidimensional Klein- Gordon-Fock equation with a time-dependent Bessel operator is investigated. Applying the generalized Erdelyi-Kober operator of fractional order, the problem posed is reduced to the Cauchy problem for the polywave equation. An explicit formula for solving this problem is constructed by the spherical mean method. On the basis of the solution obtained, an integral representation of the solution of the problem is found. "
"In a sample of 471 million BB events collected with the BABAR detector at the PEP-II e+e- collider we study the rare decays B -> K(*) l+ l-, where l+ l- is either e+e- or mu+mu-. We report results on partial branching fractions and isospin asymmetries in seven bins of di-lepton mass-squared. We further present CP and lepton-flavor asymmetries for di-lepton masses below and above the J/psi resonance. We find no evidence for CP or lepton-flavor violation. The partial branching fractions and isospin asymmetries are consistent with the Standard Model predictions and with results from other experiments. "
"The electronic states of surface adatoms in Na(Fe0.96Co0.03Mn0.01)As have been studied by low temperature scanning tunneling spectroscopy. The spectra recorded on the adatoms display both superconducting coherence peaks and an asymmetric resonance in a larger energy scale. The Fano-type line shape of the spectra points towards a possible Kondo effect at play. The apparent energy position of the resonance peak shifts about 5 meV to the Fermi level when measured across the critical temperature, supporting that the Bogoliubov quasiparticle is responsible for the Kondo screening in the superconducting state. The tunneling spectra do not show the subgap bound states, which is explained as the weak pair breaking effect given by the weak and broad scattering potential after the Kondo screening. "
"We report time-resolved photometric observations of the Hamburg Quasar Survey-selected dwarf nova HS 1449+6415 (= RX J1450.5+6403) during the interval from JD 2451672 to 2451724. During a long outburst with a duration of ~12 days, we detected superhumps with a period of 0.0601(5) d, revealing that this star is an SU UMa star. A short outburst which lasted 3 days was found about 40 days after the onset of the superoutburst. From quiescence observations, we determine an orbital period of 0.05898(2) d. The small outburst amplitude of \~3.5 mag, the short orbital period, and the normal outburst cycle length suggest that HS 1449+6415 is an intermediate object between ER UMa stars with high mass-transfer rates and WZ Sge stars with very low mass-transfer rates. "
"We investigate the rank of the average mixing matrix of trees, with all eigenvalues distinct. The rank of the average mixing matrix of a tree on $n$ vertices with $n$ distinct eigenvalues is upper-bounded by $\frac{n}{2}$. Computations on trees up to $20$ vertices suggest that the rank attains this upper bound most of the times. We give an infinite family of trees whose average mixing matrices have ranks which are bounded away from this upper bound. We also give a lower bound on the rank of the average mixing matrix of a tree. "
"We consider $m$ spinless Bosons distributed over $l$ degenerate single-particle states and interacting through a $k$-body random interaction with Gaussian probability distribution (the Bosonic embedded $k$-body ensembles). We address the cases of orthogonal and unitary symmetry in the limit of infinite matrix dimension, attained either as $l \to \infty$ or as $m \to \infty$. We derive an eigenvalue expansion for the second moment of the many-body matrix elements of these ensembles. Using properties of this expansion, the supersymmetry technique, and the binary correlation method, we show that in the limit $l \to \infty$ the ensembles have nearly the same spectral properties as the corresponding Fermionic embedded ensembles. Novel features specific for Bosons arise in the dense limit defined as $m \to \infty$ with both $k$ and $l$ fixed. Here we show that the ensemble is not ergodic, and that the spectral fluctuations are not of Wigner-Dyson type. We present numerical results for the dense limit using both ensemble unfolding and spectral unfolding. These differ strongly, demonstrating the lack of ergodicity of the ensemble. Spectral unfolding shows a strong tendency towards picket-fence type spectra. Certain eigenfunctions of individual realizations of the ensemble display Fock-space localization. "
"We prove that in Euclidean space $R^{n+1}$ any compact immersed nonnegatively curved hypersurface $M$ with free boundary on the sphere $S^n$ is an embedded convex topological disk. In particular, when the $m^{th}$ mean curvature of $M$ is constant, for any $1\leq m\leq n$, $M$ is a spherical cap or an equatorial disk. "
"We propose a simple procedure for evaluating the main thermodynamical attributes of a Schwarzschild's black hole: Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, Hawking's temperature and Bekenstein's quantization of the surface area. We make use of the condition that the circumference of a great circle on the black hole horizon contains finite number of the corresponding reduced Compton's wavelength. It is essentially analogous to Bohr's quantization postulate in Bohr's atomic model interpreted by de Broglie's relation. We present black hole radiation in the form conceptually analogous to Bohr's postulate on the photon emission by discrete quantum jump of the electron within the Old quantum theory. It enables us, in accordance with Heisenberg's uncertainty relation and Bohr's correspondence principle, to make a rough estimate of the time interval for black hole evaporation, which turns out very close to time interval predicted by the standard Hawking's theory. Our calculations confirm Bekenstein's semiclassical result for the energy quantization, in variance with Frasca's (2005) calculations. Finally we speculate about the possible source-energy distribution within the black hole horizon. "
"We report low temperature electronic transport results on the fractional quantum Hall effect of composite fermions at Landau level filling nu = 4/11 in a very high mobility and low density sample. Measurements were carried out at temperatures down to 15mK, where an activated magnetoresistance Rxx and a quantized Hall resistance Rxy, within 1% of the expected value of h/(4/11)e^2, were observed. The temperature dependence of the Rxx minimum at 4/11 yields an activation energy gap of ~ 7 mK. Developing Hall plateaus were also observed at the neighboring states at nu = 3/8 and 5/13. "
"Polarization effects are included exactly in a model for a quantum dot in close proximity to a planar interface. Efficient incorporation of this potential into the Schr\""{o}dinger equation is utilized to map out the influence of the image potential effects on carrier tunneling in such heterostructures. In particular, the interplay between carrier mass and the dielectric constants of a quantum dot, its surrounding matrix, and the electrode is studied. We find that the polarizability of the planar electrode structure can significantly increase the tunneling rates for heavier carriers, potentially resulting in a qualitative change in the dependence of tunneling rate on mass. Our method for treating polarization can be generalized to the screening of two particle interactions, and can thus be applied to calculations such as exciton dissociation and the Coulomb blockade. In contrast to tunneling via intermediate surface localized states of the quantum dot, our work identifies the parameter space over which volume states undergo significant modification in their tunneling characteristics. "
"Fourier reconstruction algorithms significantly outperform conventional back-projection algorithms in terms of computation time. In photoacoustic imaging, these methods require interpolation in the Fourier space domain, which creates artifacts in reconstructed images. We propose a novel reconstruction algorithm that applies the one-dimensional nonuniform fast Fourier transform to photoacoustic imaging. It is shown theoretically and numerically that our algorithm avoids artifacts while preserving the computational effectiveness of Fourier reconstruction. "
We determine the path of the light around a dielectric vortex described by the relativistic vortex flow of a perfect fluid.
"The abundance of different species in a community often follows the log series distribution. Other ecological patterns also have simple forms. Why does the complexity and variability of ecological systems reduce to such simplicity? Common answers include maximum entropy, neutrality, and convergent outcome from different underlying biological processes. This article proposes a more general answer based on the concept of invariance, the property by which a pattern remains the same after transformation. Invariance has a long tradition in physics. For example, general relativity emphasizes the need for the equations describing the laws of physics to have the same form in all frames of reference. By bringing this unifying invariance approach into ecology, we show that the log series pattern dominates when the consequences of processes acting on abundance are invariant to the addition or multiplication of abundance by a constant. The lognormal pattern dominates when the processes acting on net species growth rate obey rotational invariance (symmetry) with respect to the summing up of the individual component processes. Recognizing how these invariances connect pattern to process leads to a synthesis of previous approaches. First, invariance provides a simpler and more fundamental maximum entropy derivation of the log series distribution. Second, invariance provides a simple derivation of the key result from neutral theory: the log series at the metacommunity scale and a clearer form of the skewed lognormal at the local community scale. The invariance expressions are easy to understand because they uniquely describe the basic underlying components that shape pattern. "
"Here we report on observations of the radio magnetar PSR J1622-4950 at frequencies from 1.4 to 17 GHz. We show that although its flux density is varying up to a factor of ~10 within a few days, it has on average decreased by a factor of 2 over the last 700 days. At the same time, timing analysis indicates a trend of decreasing spin-down rate over our entire data set, again of about a factor of 2 over 700 days, but also an erratic variability in the spin-down rate within this time span. Integrated pulse profiles are often close to 100 per cent linearly polarized, but large variations in both the profile shape and fractional polarization are regularly observed. Furthermore, the behaviour of the position angle of the linear polarization is very complex - offsets in both the absolute position angle and the phase of the position angle sweep are often seen and the occasional presence of orthogonal mode jumps further complicates the picture. However, model fitting indicates that the magnetic and rotation axes are close to aligned. Finally, a single pulse analysis has been carried out at four observing frequencies, demonstrating that the wide pulse profile is built up of narrow spikes of emission, with widths that scale inversely with observing frequency. All three of the known radio magnetars seem to have similar characteristics, with highly polarized emission, time-variable flux density and pulse profiles, and with spectral indices close to zero. "
"Within an axiomatic framework, we prove that the existence of faster than light particles is consistent with (does not contradict) the dynamics of Einstein's special relativity. "
"We present a method for estimating the density of states of a classical statistical model. The algorithm successfully combines the Wang-Landau flat histogram method with the N-fold way in order to improve efficiency of the original single spin flip version. We test our implementation of the Wang-Landau method with the two-dimensional nearest neighbor Ising model for which we determine the tunneling time and the density of states. Furthermore, we show that our new algorithm performs correctly at right edges of an energy interval over which the density of states is computed. This removes a disadvantage of the original single spin flip Wang-Landau method where results showed systematically higher errors in the density of states at right boundaries. We compare our data with the detailed numerical tests presented in a study by Wang and Swendsen where the original Wang-Landau method was tested against various other methods. Finally, we apply our method to a thin Ising film of size $32\times 32\times 6$ with antisymmetric surface fields. With the density of states obtained from the simulations we calculate canonical averages related to the energy such as internal energy, Gibbs free energy and entropy, but we also sample microcanonical averages during simulations in order to determine canonical averages of the susceptibility, the order parameter and its fourth order cumulant. We compare our results with simulational data obtained from a conventional MC algorithm. "
"We sample a velocity field that has an inertial spectrum and a skewness that matches experimental data. In particular, we compute a self-consistent correction to the Kolmogorov exponent and find that for our model it is zero. We find that the higher order structure functions diverge for orders larger than a certain threshold, as theorized in some recent work. The significance of the results for the statistical theory of homogeneous turbulence is reviewed. "
"For an ample line bundle $\mathcal{L}$ on a complete toric surface $X$, we consider the subset $V_{\mathcal{L}} \subset \vert \mathcal{L} \vert$ of irreducible nodal rational curves contained in the smooth locus of $X$. We study the monodromy map from the fundamental group of $V_{\mathcal{L}}$ to the permutation group on the set of nodes of a reference curve $C \in V_{\mathcal{L}}$. We show that the monodromy has to preserve a certain obstruction map $\varPsi_{X}$ from the set of nodes of $C$ to a finite set depending solely on $X$. Provided that $\mathcal{L}$ is sufficiently big (in a sense we precise below), we show that the image of the monodromy is exactly the group of deck transformations of the map $\varPsi_{X}$. Along the way, we provide a handy tool to compute the image of the monodromy for any pair $(X, \mathcal{L})$. Eventually, we provide some examples of pairs $(X, \mathcal{L})$ with small $\mathcal{L}$ and for which the image of the monodromy is strictly smaller than expected. "
"Security of multimedia data is a major concern due to its widespread transmission over various communication channels. Hence design and study of good image encryption schemes has become a major research topic. During the last few decades, there has been a increasing in chaos-based cryptography. This paper proposes an attack on a recently proposed chaos based image encryption scheme. The cryptosystem under study proceed by first shuffling the original image to disturb the arrangement of pixels by applying a chaotic map several times. Second, a keystream is generated using Chen's chaotic system to mix it with the shuffled pixels to finally obtain the cipher image. A chosen ciphertext attack can be done to recover the system without any knowledge of the key. It simply demands two pairs of plaintext-ciphertext to completely break the cryptosystem. "
"We consider a device-to-device (D2D) underlaid cellular network, where each cellular channel can be shared by several D2D pairs and only one channel can be allocated to each D2D pair. We try to maximize the sum rate of D2D pairs while limiting the interference to cellular links. Due to the lack of global information in large scale networks, resource allocation is hard to be implemented in a centralized way. Therefore, we design a novel distributed resource allocation scheme which is based on local information and requires little coordination and communication between D2D pairs. Specifically, we decompose the original problem into two cascaded subproblems, namely channel allocation and power control. The cascaded structure of our scheme enables us to cope with them respectively. Then a two-stage algorithm is proposed. In the first stage, we model the channel allocation problem as a many-to-one matching with externalities and try to find a strongly swap-stable matching. In the second stage, we adopt a pricing mechanism and develop an iterative two-step algorithm to solve the power control problem. "
"A novel effect of fast heating and charging a finite-radius plasma is discovered in the context of plasma wakefield acceleration. As the plasma wave breaks, the most of its energy is transferred to plasma electrons which create strong charge-separation electric field and azimuthal magnetic field around the plasma. The slowly varying field structure is preserved for hundreds of wakefield periods and contains (together with hot electrons) up to 80% of the initial wakefield energy. "
"We briefly describe and discuss the set-up of the project MOCCA Survey Database I. The database contains more than 2000 Monte Carlo models of evolution of real star cluster performed with the MOCCA code. Then, we very briefly discuss results of analysis of the database regarding the following projects: formation of intermediate mass black holes, abrupt cluster dissolution harboring black hole subsystems, retention fraction of black hole - black hole mergers, and tidal disruption events with intermediate mass black holes. "
"We derive the black hole mass density as a function of redshift with the bolometric luminosity function of AGN assuming that massive black holes grew via accreting the circumnuclear gases, in which the derived black hole mass density is required to match the measured local black hole mass density at z=0. ADAFs are supposed to present in low luminosity AGNs/normal galaxies, which are very hot and radiate mostly in the hard X-ray band. Most of the XRB is contributed by bright AGNs, and a variety of AGN population synthesis models were developed to model the observed XRB in the last two decades. Based on our derived black hole mass density, we calculate the contribution to the XRB from the ADAFs in faint AGNs/normal galaxies with a given Eddington ratio distribution, which is mostly in hard X-ray energy band with an energy peak at ~200 keV. The growth of massive black holes during ADAF phase can therefore be constrained with the observed XRB. Combining an AGN population synthesis model with our results, we find that the fitting on the observed XRB, especially at hard X-ray energy band with \ga 100 keV, is improved provided the contribution of the ADAFs in low luminosity AGNs/normal galaxies is properly included. It is found that less than ~15 per cent of local massive black hole mass density was accreted during ADAF phases. We suggest that more accurate measurements of the XRB in the energy band with \ga 100 keV in the future may help constrain the growth of massive black holes at their late stage. We also calculate their contribution to the extragalactic gamma-ray background, and find that less than ~1% of the observed EGRB is contributed by the ADAFs in these faint sources. "
"The Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) is a chiral interaction that favors formation of domain walls. Recent experiments and ab initio calculations show that there are multiple ways to modify the strength of the interfacially induced DMI in thin ferromagnetic films with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. In this paper we reveal theoretically the effects of spatially varied DMI on the magnetic state in thin films. In such heterochiral 2D structures we report several emergent phenomena, ranging from the equilibrium spin canting at the interface between regions with different DMI, over particularly strong confinement of domain walls and skyrmions within high-DMI tracks, to advanced applications such as domain tailoring nearly at will, design of magnonic waveguides, and much improved skyrmion racetrack memory. "
"We report on a simulation in progress of an SU(2) X U(1) fermion-Higgs model with two *non-degenerate* fermion doublets. The Zaragoza proposal for chiral lattice fermions is used; naive fermions are studied for comparison. The aims of this simulation are a non-perturbative study of the decoupling of species doublers, of triviality bounds on the Higgs and fermion masses and of the phenomenological quantity Delta-rho. "
"A signed network represents how a set of nodes are connected by two logically contradictory types of links: positive and negative links. In a signed products network, two products can be complementary (purchased together) or substitutable (purchased instead of each other). Such contradictory types of links may play dramatically different roles in the spreading process of information, opinion, behavior etc. In this work, we propose a Self-Avoiding Pruning (SAP) random walk on a signed network to model e.g. a user's purchase activity on a signed products network. A SAP walk starts at a random node. At each step, the walker moves to a positive neighbour that is randomly selected and its previously visited node together with its negative neighbours are removed. We explored both analytically and numerically how signed network topological features influence the key performance of a SAP walk: the evolution of the pruned network resulted from the node removals, the length of a SAP walk and the visiting probability of each node. These findings in signed network models are further verified in two real-world signed networks. Our findings may inspire the design of recommender systems regarding how recommendations and competitions may influence consumers' purchases and products' popularity. "
"Quantum communication has been successfully implemented in optical fibres and through free-space [1-3]. Fibre systems, though capable of fast key rates and low quantum bit error rates (QBERs), are impractical in communicating with destinations without an established fibre link [4]. Free-space quantum channels can overcome such limitations and reach long distances with the advent of satellite-to-ground links [5-8]. Shorter line-of-sight free-space links have also been realized for intra-city conditions [2, 9]. However, turbulence, resulting from local fluctuations in refractive index, becomes a major challenge by adding errors and losses [10]. Recently, an interest in investigating the possibility of underwater quantum channels has arisen, which could provide global secure communication channels among submersibles and boats [11-13]. Here, we investigate the effect of turbulence on an underwater quantum channel using twisted photons in outdoor conditions. We study the effect of turbulence on transmitted QBERs, and compare different QKD protocols in an underwater quantum channel showing the feasibility of high-dimensional encoding schemes. Our work may open the way for secure high-dimensional quantum communication between submersibles, and provides important input for potential submersibles-to-satellite quantum communication. "
"Given $m$ points and $n$ hyperplanes in $\mathbb{R}^d$, if there are many incidences, we expect to find a big cluster $K_{r,s}$ in their incidence graph. Apfelbaum and Sharir found lower and upper bounds for the largest size of $rs$, which only match in three dimensions. In this paper we close the gap in four and five dimensions, up to some logarithmic factors. "
"We identify fundamental issues with discretization when estimating information-theoretic quantities in the analysis of data. These difficulties are theoretical in nature and arise with discrete datasets carrying significant implications for the corresponding claims and results. Here we describe the origins of the methodological problems, and provide a clear illustration of their impact with the example of biological network reconstruction. We propose an algorithm (shared information metric) that corrects for the biases and the resulting improved performance of the algorithm demonstrates the need to take due consideration of this issue in different contexts. "
"We account for the different symmetries of the 2^{1,3}S helium excited states in a quasiclassical description of the knockout mechanism augmented by a quantum shakeoff contribution. We are thus able to formulate the separate contribution of the knockout and shakeoff mechanisms for double photoionization for any excess energy from the 2^{1,3}S states. Photoionization ratios and singly differential cross sections calculated for the 2^{1,3}S excited states of helium are found to be in very good agreement with recent theoretical results. "
"Engineering and harnessing coherent excitonic transport in organic nanostructures has recently been suggested as a promising way towards improving man-made light harvesting materials. However, realising and testing the dissipative system-environment models underlying these proposals is presently very challenging in supramolecular materials. A promising alternative is to use simpler and highly tunable quantum simulators built from programmable qubits, as recently achieved in a superconducting circuit by Potocnik et al. In this article, we simulate the real-time dynamics of an exciton coupled to a quantum bath as it moves through a network based on the quantum circuit of Potocnik et al. Using the numerically exact hierarchical equations of motion to capture the open quantum system dynamics, we find that an ultrafast but completely incoherent relaxation from a high-lying bright exciton into a doublet of closely spaced dark excitons can spontaneously generate electronic coherences and oscillatory real-space motion across the network (quantum beats). Importantly, we show that this behaviour also survives when the environmental noise is classically stochastic (effectively high temperature), as in present experiments, and also leads to a novel, transient violation of detailed balance in the population relaxation. These predictions highlight the possibilities of designing matched electronic and spectral noise structures for robust coherence generation that does not require coherent excitation or cold environments. "
"In a recent paper the so-called Spectrum Generating Algebra (SGA) technique has been applied to the N-dimensional Taub-NUT system, a maximally superintegrable Hamiltonian system which can be interpreted as a one-parameter deformation of the Kepler-Coulomb system. Such a Hamiltonian is associated to a specific Bertrand space of non-constant curvature. The SGA procedure unveils the symmetry algebra underlying the Hamiltonian system and, moreover, enables one to solve the equations of motion. Here we will follow the same path to tackle the Darboux III system, another maximally superintegrable system, which can indeed be viewed as a natural deformation of the isotropic harmonic oscillator where the flat Euclidean space is again replaced by another space of non-constant curvature. "
"The parallel execution of requests in a Cloud Computing platform, as for Virtualized Network Functions, is modeled by an $M^{[X]}/M/1$ Processor-Sharing (PS) system, where each request is seen as a batch of unit jobs. The performance of such paralleled system can then be measured by the quantiles of the batch sojourn time distribution. In this paper, we address the evaluation of this distribution for the $M^{[X]}/M/1$-PS queue with batch arrivals and geometrically distributed batch size. General results on the residual busy period (after a tagged batch arrival time) and the number of unit jobs served during this residual busy period are first derived. This enables us to provide an approximation for the distribution tail of the batch sojourn time whose accuracy is confirmed by simulation. "
"Being fast rotating objects, Isolated Neutron Stars (INSs) are natural targets for high-time resolution observations across the whole electromagnetic spectrum. With the number of objects detected at optical (plus ultraviolet and infrared) wavelengths now increased to 24, high-time resolution observations of INSs at these wavelengths are becoming more and more important. While classical rotation-powered radio pulsars, like the Crab and Vela pulsars, have been the first INSs studied at high-time resolution in the optical domain, observations performed in the last two decades have unveiled potential targets in other types of INSs which are not rotation powered, although their periodic variability is still related to the neutron star rotation. In this paper I review the current status of high-time resolution observations of INSs in the optical domain for different classes of objects: rotation-powered pulsars, magnetars, thermally emitting neutron stars, and rapid radio transients, I describe their timing properties, and I outline the scientific potentials of their optical timing studies. "
"We measured the low-temperature thermal conductivity of a new layered superconductor with quasi-one-dimensional characteristics, the ternary telluride Ta$_4$Pd$_3$Te$_{16}$ with transition temperature $T_c \approx$ 4.3 K. The significant residual linear term of thermal conductivity in zero magnetic field and its rapid field dependence provide evidences for nodes in the superconducting gap. By measuring resistivity under pressures, we reveal a superconducting dome in the temperature-pressure phase diagram. The existence of gap nodes and superconducting dome suggests unconventional superconductivity in Ta$_4$Pd$_3$Te$_{16}$, which may relate to a charge-density wave instability in this low-dimensional compound. "
"We analytically compute, through the six-and-a-half post-Newtonian order, the second-order-in-eccentricity piece of the Detweiler-Barack-Sago gauge-invariant redshift function for a small mass in eccentric orbit around a Schwarzschild black hole. Using the first law of mechanics for eccentric orbits [A. Le Tiec, Phys. Rev. D {\bf 92}, 084021 (2015)] we transcribe our result into a correspondingly accurate knowledge of the second radial potential of the effective-one-body formalism [A. Buonanno and T. Damour, Phys. Rev. D {\bf 59}, 084006 (1999)]. We compare our newly acquired analytical information to several different numerical self-force data and find good agreement, within estimated error bars. We also obtain, for the first time, independent analytical checks of the recently derived, comparable-mass fourth-post-Newtonian order dynamics [T. Damour, P. Jaranowski and G. Shaefer, Phys. Rev. D {\bf 89}, 064058 (2014)]. "
Using equivalencies between different models we reduce the model of two spin-1/2 Heisenberg chains crossed at one point to the model of free fermions. The spin-spin correlation function is calculated by summing the perturbation series in the interchain coupling. The result reveals a power law decay with a nonuniversal exponent.
"We formulate a conjecture characterizing smooth projective varieties in positive characteristic whose Frobenius morphism can be lifted modulo $p^2$ - we expect that such varieties, after a finite \'etale cover, admit a Zariski-locally trivial fibration with toric fibers over an ordinary abelian variety. We prove that this assertion implies a conjecture of Occhetta and Wi\'sniewski, which states that a smooth image of a projective toric variety is a toric variety. In order to deal with an important special case, we develop a logarithmic variant of the characterization of ordinary varieties with trivial tangent bundle due to Mehta and Srinivas. Furthermore, we verify our conjecture for surfaces, Fano threefolds, and homogeneous spaces (answering a question posed by Buch-Thomsen-Lauritzen-Mehta). Our proofs are based on a comprehensive theory of Frobenius liftings together with a variety of other techniques including deformation theory of rational curves and Frobenius splittings. "
"A pair of transverse wobbling bands has been observed in the nucleus $^{135}$Pr. The wobbling is characterized by $\Delta I$ =1, E2 transitions between the bands, and a decrease in the wobbling energy confirms its transverse nature. Additionally, a transition from transverse wobbling to a three-quasiparticle band comprised of strong magnetic dipole transitions is observed. These observations conform well to results from calculations with the Tilted Axis Cranking (TAC) model and the Quasiparticle Triaxial Rotor (QTR) Model. "
"We discuss a procedure to construct multi-resolution analyses (MRA) of $\Lc^2(\R)$ starting from a given {\em seed} function $h(s)$ which should satisfy some conditions. Our method, originally related to the quantum mechanical hamiltonian of the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE), is shown to be model independent. The role of a canonical map between certain canonically conjugate operators is discussed. This clarifies our previous procedure and makes much easier most of the original formulas, producing a convenient framework to produce examples of MRA. "
"Similarity-Projection structures abstract the numerical properties of real scalar product of rays and projections in Hilbert spaces to provide a more general framework for Quantum Physics. They are characterized by properties that possess direct physical meaning. They provide a formal framework that subsumes both classical boolean logic concerned with sets and subsets and quantum logic concerned with Hilbert space, closed subspaces and projections. They shed light on the role of the phase factors that are central to Quantum Physics. The generalization of the notion of a self-adjoint operator to SP-structures provides a novel notion that is free of linear algebra. "
"The complexity of quantum computation remains poorly understood. While physicists attempt to find ways to create quantum computers, we still do not have much evidence one way or the other as to how useful these machines will be. The tools of computational complexity theory should come to bear on these important questions. Quantum computing often scares away many potential researchers from computer science because of the apparent background need in quantum mechanics and the alien looking notation used in papers on the topic. This paper will give an overview of quantum computation from the point of view of a complexity theorist. We will see that one can think of BQP as yet another complexity class and study its power without focusing on the physical aspects behind it. "
"We propose new interactions of a (massive) vector multiplet with chiral multiplets and (D-type) spontaneously broken supersymmetry in four-dimensional N=1 supergravity, due to the generalized Fayet-Iliopoulos (FI) terms. Our actions are invariant under linearly realized off-shell supersymmetry and Kaehler-Weyl transformations. We compute the scalar potentials and pinpoint some physical restrictions arising in this approach. "
"Both caching and interference alignment (IA) are promising techniques for future wireless networks. Nevertheless, most of existing works on cache-enabled IA wireless networks assume that the channel is invariant, which is unrealistic considering the time-varying nature of practical wireless environments. In this paper, we consider realistic time-varying channels. Specifically, the channel is formulated as a finite-state Markov channel (FSMC). The complexity of the system is very high when we consider realistic FSMC models. Therefore, we propose a novel big data reinforcement learning approach in this paper. Deep reinforcement learning is an advanced reinforcement learning algorithm that uses deep $Q$ network to approximate the $Q$ value-action function. Deep reinforcement learning is used in this paper to obtain the optimal IA user selection policy in cache-enabled opportunistic IA wireless networks. Simulation results are presented to show the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. "
"We have performed high-resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy on heavily electron-doped non-superconducting (SC) BaFe$_{1.7}$Co$_{0.3}$As$_2$. We find that the two hole Fermi surface pockets at the zone center observed in the hole-doped superconducting Ba$_{0.6}$K$_{0.4}$Fe$_2$As$_2$ are absent or very small in this compound, while the two electron pockets at the M point significantly expand due to electron doping by the Co substitution. Comparison of the Fermi surface between non-SC and SC samples indicates that the coexistence of hole and electron pockets connected via the antiferromagnetic wave vector is essential in realizing the mechanism of superconductivity in the iron-based superconductors. "
"Laplacian growth, associated to the diffusion-limited aggregation (DLA) model or the more general dielectric-breakdown model (DBM), is a fundamental out-of-equilibrium process that generates structures with characteristic fractal/non-fractal morphologies. However, despite of diverse numerical and theoretical attempts, a data-consistent description of the fractal dimensions of the mass-distributions of these structures has been missing. Here, an analytical description to the fractal dimensions of the DBM and DLA is provided by means of a recently introduced general dimensionality equation for the scaling of clusters undergoing a continuous morphological transition. Particularly, this equation relies on an effective information-function dependent on the Euclidean dimension of the embedding-space and the control parameter of the system. Numerical and theoretical approaches are used in order to determine this information-function for both DLA and DBM. In the latter, a connection to the R\'enyi entropies and generalized dimensions of the cluster is made, showing that DLA could be considered as the point of maximum information-entropy production along the DBM transition. These findings are in good agreement with previous theoretical and numerical results (two- and three-dimensional DBM, and high-dimensional DLA). Notably, the DBM dimensions can be conformed to a universal description independently of the initial cluster-configuration and the embedding-space. "
"We use the $q$-binomial theorem, the $q$-Gauss sum, and the ${}_2\phi_1 \rightarrow {}_2\phi_2$ transformation of Jackson to discover and prove many new weighted partition identities. These identities involve unrestricted partitions, overpartitions, and partitions with distinct even parts. Smallest part of the partitions plays an important role in our analysis. This work was motivated in part by the research of Krishna Alladi. "
"The NA60 experiment has studied low-mass muon pair production in proton-nucleus collisions with a system of Be, Cu, In, W, Pb and U targets using a 400 GeV/$c$ proton beam at the CERN SPS. The mass spectrum is well described by the superposition of the two-body and Dalitz decays of the light neutral mesons $\eta$, $\rho$, $\omega$, $\eta'$ and $\phi$. A new high-precision measurement of the electromagnetic transition form factors of the $\eta$ and $\omega$ mesons is presented, complemented with a measurement of the temperature parameter of the $\rho$ meson in cold nuclear matter. The $\pt$ spectra for the $\omega$ and $\phi$ mesons are extracted in the full $\pt$ range accessible, up to $\pt = 2$ GeV/$c$. The nuclear dependence of the production cross sections for the $\eta$, $\omega$ and $\phi$ mesons has been investigated in terms of the power law $\sigma_\mathrm{pA} \propto \mathrm{A}^\alpha$, and the $\alpha$ parameter was studied as a function of $\pt$. "
"We consider the generalized Korteweg-de Vries equation $$ \partial_t u + \partial_x (\partial_x^2 u + f(u))=0, \quad (t,x)\in [0,T)\times \mathbb{R}$$ with general $C^2$ nonlinearity $f$. Under an explicit condition on $f$ and $c>0$, there exists a solution in the energy space $H^1$ of the type $u(t,x)=Q_c(x-x_0-ct)$, called soliton. Stability theory for $Q_c$ is well-known. In previous works, we have proved that for $f(u)=u^p$, $p=2,3,4$, the family of solitons is asymptotically stable in some local sense in $H^1$, i.e. if $u(t)$ is close to $Q_{c}$ (for all $t\geq 0$), then $u(t,.+\rho(t))$ locally converges in the energy space to some $Q_{c_+}$ as $t\to +\infty$, for some $c^+\sim c$. Then, the asymptotic stability result could be extended to the case of general assumptions on $f$ and $Q_c$. The objective of this paper is twofold. The main objective is to prove that in the case $f(u)=u^p$, $p=2,3,4$, $\rho(t)-c_+ t$ has limit as $t\to +\infty$ under the additional assumption $x_+ u\in L^2$. The second objective of this paper is to provide large time stability and asymptotic stability results for two soliton solutions for the case of general nonlinearity $f(u)$, when the ratio of the speeds of the solitons is small. The motivation is to accompany forthcoming works devoted to the collision of two solitons in the nonintegrable case. The arguments are refinements of previous works specialized to the case $u(t)\sim Q_{c_1}+Q_{c_2}$, for $0< c_2 \ll c_1$. "
"We study the merging and splitting of quasi-two-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensates with strong dipolar interactions. We observe that if the dipoles have a non-zero component in the plane of the condensate, the dynamics of merging or splitting along two orthogonal directions, parallel and perpendicular to the projection of dipoles on the plane of the condensate are different. The anisotropic merging and splitting of the condensate is a manifestation of the anisotropy of the roton-like mode in the dipolar system. The difference in dynamics disappears if the dipoles are oriented at right angles to the plane of the condensate as in this case the Bogoliubov dispersion, despite having roton-like features, is isotropic. "
"This paper studies the possibility of using axicons in Free Space Optics (FSO) systems. The behavior of the pseudo- Bessel beams generated by ""logarithmic"" and ""linear"" axicons, with or without stops, was analyzed through the Huygens-Fresnel integral of diffraction in cylindrical coordinates. We also show that GRIN (Gradient Index) axicons, when well designed, could be used in order to choose the intensity pattern along the propagation axis, which could be a new technique for the alignment equipment. "
"We consider deeply the relation between the orthogonality and the distinguishability of a set of arbitrary states (including multi-partite states). It is shown that if a set of arbitrary states can be distinguished by local operations and classical communication (LOCC), \QTR{it}{\}each of the states can be written as a linear combination of product vectors such that all product vectors of one of the states are orthogonal to the other states. With this result we then prove a simple necessary condition for LOCC distinguishability of a class of orthogonal states. These conclusions may be useful in discussing the distinguishability of orthogonal quantum states further, understanding the essence of nonlocality and discussing the distillation of entanglement. "
"Concentrations of molecular hydrogen (H2) have been detected by SUMER in active region plage. The H2 is excited by O VI line emission at 1031.94 A which, although not observed, must be brightening along with the observed transition region line, Si III 1113.24 A. We have made co-ordinated observations of active region plage with the spectrometer SUMER/SoHO in lines of H2 1119.10 A and Si III 1113.24 A and with XRT/Hinode X-ray and SOT/Hinode Ca II filters. In six hours of observation, six of the seven H2 events seen occurred near a footpoint of a brightening X-ray loop. The seventh is associated with an unusually strong Si III plasma outflow. We conclude that microflare energy dissipation heats the chromosphere, reducing its opacity, so that O VI microflare emission is able to reach the lower layers of the chromosphere and excite the H2. "
Using the exact path integral solution of the Schwinger model -- a model where instantons are present -- the Dyson-Schwinger equation is shown to hold by explicit computation. It turns out that the Dyson-Schwinger equation separately holds for every instanton sector. This is due to Theta-invariance of the Schwinger model.
"Past work in computational sarcasm deals primarily with sarcasm detection. In this paper, we introduce a novel, related problem: sarcasm target identification i.e., extracting the target of ridicule in a sarcastic sentence). We present an introductory approach for sarcasm target identification. Our approach employs two types of extractors: one based on rules, and another consisting of a statistical classifier. To compare our approach, we use two baselines: a na\""ive baseline and another baseline based on work in sentiment target identification. We perform our experiments on book snippets and tweets, and show that our hybrid approach performs better than the two baselines and also, in comparison with using the two extractors individually. Our introductory approach establishes the viability of sarcasm target identification, and will serve as a baseline for future work. "
"In this paper, a general FRW cosmological model has been constructed in $f(R,T)$ gravity reconstruction with variable cosmological constant. A number of solutions to the field equations has been generated by utilizing a form for the Hubble parameter that leads to Berman's law of constant deceleration parameter $q=m-1$. The possible decelerating and accelerating solutions have been investigated. For ($q>0$) we get a stable flat decelerating radiation-dominated universe at $q=1$. For ($q<0$) we get a stable accelerating solution describing a flat universe with positive energy density and negative cosmological constant. Nonconventional mechanisms that are expected to address the late-time acceleration with negative cosmological constant have been discussed. "
"We study the interacting Fermi-Hubbard model in two spatial dimensions with synthetic gauge coupling of the spin orbit Rashba type, at half-filling. Using real space mean field theory, we numerically determine the phase as a function of the interaction strength for different values of the gauge field parameters. For a fixed value of the gauge field, we observe that when the strength of the repulsive interaction is increased, the system enters into an antiferromagnetic phase, then undergoes a first order phase transition to an non collinear magnetic phase. Depending on the gauge field parameter, this phase further evolves to the one predicted from the effective Heisenberg model obtained in the limit of large interaction strength. We explain the presence of the antiferromagnetic phase at small interaction from the computation of the spin-spin susceptibility which displays a divergence at low temperatures for the antiferromagnetic ordering. We discuss, how the divergence is related to the nature of the underlying Fermi surfaces. Finally, the fact that the first order phase transitions for different gauge field parameters occur at unrelated critical interaction strengths arises from a Hofstadter-like situation, i.e. for different magnetic phases, the mean-field Hamiltonians have different translational symmetries.

"Coarsening on a one-dimensional lattice is described by the voter model or equivalently by coalescing (or annihilating) random walks representing the evolving boundaries between regions of constant color and by backward (in time) coalescing random walks corresponding to color genealogies. Asympotics for large time and space on the lattice are described via a continuum space-time voter model whose boundary motion is expressed by the {\it Brownian web} (BW) of coalescing forward Brownian motions. In this paper, we study how small noise in the voter model, corresponding to the nucleation of randomly colored regions, can be treated in the continuum limit. We present a full construction of the continuum noisy voter model (CNVM) as a random {\it quasicoloring} of two-dimensional space time and derive some of its properties. Our construction is based on a Poisson marking of the {\it backward} BW within the {\it double} (i.e., forward and backward) BW. "
"Elucidating the appropriate microscopic degrees of freedom within neutron stars remains an open question which impacts nuclear physics, particle physics and astrophysics. The recent discovery of the first non-trivial dibaryon, the $d^*(2380)$, provides a new candidate for an exotic degree of freedom in the nuclear equation of state at high matter densities. In this paper a first calculation of the role of the $d^*(2380)$ in neutron stars is performed, based on a relativistic mean field description of the nucleonic degrees of freedom supplemented by a free boson gas of $d^*(2380)$. The calculations indicate that the $d^*(2380)$ would appear at densities around three times normal nuclear matter saturation density, influencing the upper mass limit for a stable neutron star and the neutron and proton fractions. New possibilities for neutron star cooling mechanisms arising from the $d^*(2380)$ are also predicted. "
"Flash Analog to Digital Convertor (FADC) is frequently used in nuclear and particle physics experiments, often as the major component in big multi-channel systems. The large data volume makes the optimization of operating parameters necessary. This article reports a study of a method to extend the dynamic range of an 8-bit FADC from the nominal $\rm{2^8}$ value. By comparing the integrated pulse area with that of a reference profile, good energy reconstruction and event identification can be achieved on saturated events from CsI(Tl) crystal scintillators. The effective dynamic range can be extended by at least 4 more bits. The algorithm is generic and is expected to be applicable to other detector systems with FADC readout. "
"We describe the set V of all real valued valuations v on the ring C[[x,y]] normalized by min{v(x),v(y)}=1. It has a natural structure of an R-tree, induced by the order relation v is less than v' iff v(f) is less than v'(f) for all f. It can also be metrized, endowing it with a metric tree structure. From the algebraic point of view, these structures are obtained by taking a suitable quotient of the Riemann-Zariski variety of C[[x,y]], in order to force it to be a Hausdorff topological space. The tree structure on V also provides an identification of valuations with balls of irreducible curves in a natural ultrametric. We show that the dual graphs of all sequences of blow-ups patch together, yielding an R-tree naturally isomorphic to V. Altogether, this gives many different approaches to the valuative tree V. We then describe a natural Laplace operator on V. It associates to (special) functions of V a complex Borel measure. Using this operator, we show how measures on the valuative tree can be used to encode naturally both integrally closed ideals in R and cohomology classes of the local analog of voute etoilee over the complex plane.

"The relation between thermodynamic phase transitions in classical systems and topological changes in their configuration space is discussed for two physical models and contains the first exact analytic computation of a topologic invariant (the Euler characteristic) of certain submanifolds in the configuration space of two physical models. The models are the mean-field XY model and the one-dimensional XY model with nearest-neighbor interactions. The former model undergoes a second-order phase transition at a finite critical temperature while the latter has no phase transitions. The computation of this topologic invariant is performed within the framework of Morse theory. In both models topology changes in configuration space are present as the potential energy is varied; however, in the mean-field model there is a particularly ""strong"" topology change, corresponding to a big jump in the Euler characteristic, connected with the phase transition, which is absent in the one-dimensional model with no phase transition. The comparison between the two models has two major consequences: i) it lends new and strong support to a recently proposed topological approach to the study of phase transitions; ii) it allows us to conjecture which particular topology changes could entail a phase transition in general. We also discuss a simplified illustrative model of the topology changes connected to phase transitions using of two-dimensional surfaces, and a possible direct connection between topological invariants and thermodynamic quantities. "
"Early studies have found quasi-reversible magnetization curves in polycrystalline bulk rare-earth iron oxypnictides that suggest either wide-spread obstacles to intergranular current or very weak vortex pinning. In the present study of polycrystalline samarium and neodymium rare-earth iron oxypnictide samples made by high pressure synthesis, the hysteretic magnetization is significantly enhanced. Magneto optical imaging and study of the field dependence of the remanent magnetization as a function of particle size both show that global currents over the whole sample do exist but that the intergranular and intragranular current densities have distinctively different temperature dependences and differ in magnitude by about 1000. Assuming that the highest current density loops are restricted to circulation only within grains leads to values of ~5 MA/cm2 at 5 K and self field, while whole-sample current densities, though two orders of magnitude lower are 1000-10000 A/cm2, some two orders of magnitude higher than in random polycrystalline cuprates. We cannot yet be certain whether this large difference in global and intragrain current density is intrinsic to the oxypnictides or due to extrinsic barriers to current flow, because the samples contain significant second phase, some of which wets the grain boundaries and produces evidences of SNS proximity effect in the whole sample critical current. "
"We present the optimal design for an on-chip single-photon source based on spontaneous four-wave mixing in a system of coupled ring microresonators, which provides frequency uncorrelated joint spectral amplitude of the biphoton field and thereby generation of pure single-photon heralded states. A simple method is proposed for suppressing negative dispersion effects by optimizing the controlled spectroscopic parameters of the system. It shown that the optimal coupling parameters, in combination with the optimal spectral width of the pump pulse, give rise to the highest purity of the heralded photons for a given pump linewidth. "
"In wireless networks, node cooperation has been exploited as a data relaying mechanism for decades. However, the wireless channel allows for much richer interaction among nodes. In particular, Distributed Information SHaring (DISH) represents a new improvement to multi-channel MAC protocol design by using a cooperative element at the control plane. In this approach, nodes exchange control information to make up for other nodes' insufficient knowledge about the environment, and thereby aid in their decision making. To date, what is lacking is a theoretical understanding of DISH. In this paper, we view cooperation as a network resource and evaluate the availability of cooperation, $p_{co}$. We first analyze $p_{co}$ in the context of a multi-channel multi-hop wireless network, and then perform simulations which show that the analysis accurately characterizes $p_{co}$ as a function of underlying network parameters. Next, we investigate the correlation between $p_{co}$ and network metrics such as collision rate, packet delay, and throughput. We find a near-linear relationship between $p_{co}$ and the metrics, which suggests that $p_{co}$ can be used as an appropriate performance indicator itself. Finally, we apply our analysis to solving a channel bandwidth allocation problem, where we derive optimal schemes and provide general guidelines on bandwidth allocation for DISH networks. "
"The paper describes the observations and first results of studying the mesosphere temperature and dust based on twilight wide-field polarization analysis using original all-sky camera started in 2015 in Apatity, northern Russia (67.6 deg N, 33.4 deg E). It is the first twilight polarization measurements session conducted in the polar region and the first measurements during the winter and early spring season. The general polarization properties of twilight sky and the separation procedure of single scattering are described. The Boltzmann temperature decrease above 70 km and lack of mesosphere dust that is typical for this season are the key results of the study. "
"Cool neutral gas provides the raw material for all star formation in the Universe, and yet, from a survey of the hosts of high redshift radio galaxies and quasars, we find a complete dearth of atomic (HI 21-cm) and molecular (OH, CO, HCO+ & HCN) absorption at redshifts z > 3. Upon a thorough analysis of the optical photometry, we find that all of our targets have ionising ultra-violet continuum luminosities of logL > 23 W/Hz. We therefore attribute this deficit to the traditional optical selection of targets biasing surveys towards the most ultra-violet luminous objects, where the intense radiation excites the neutral gas to the point where it cannot engage in star formation. However, this hypothesis does not explain why there is a critical luminosity, rather than a continuum where the detections gradually become fewer and fewer as the harshness of the radiation increases. We show that by placing a quasar within a galaxy of gas there is always a finite ultra-violet luminosity above which all of the gas is ionised. This demonstrates that these galaxies are probably devoid of star-forming material rather than this being at abundances below the sensitivity limits of current radio telescopes. "
"We calculate the full electroweak one-loop corrections to the decay of the CP-odd Higgs boson A^0 into scalar fermions in the minimal supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model. For this purpose many parameters of the MSSM have to be properly renormalized in the on-shell renormalization scheme. We have also included the SUSY-QCD corrections. For the decay into bottom squarks and tau sleptons, especially for large \tan\b, the corrections can be very large making the perturbation expansion unreliable. We solve this problem by an appropriate definition of the tree-level coupling in terms of running fermion masses and running trilinear couplings A_f. We also discuss the decay of heavy scalar fermions into light scalar fermions and A^0. We find that the corrections can be sizeable and therefore cannot be neglected. "
"We study the energy distributions of dipion transitions $\Upsilon(5S)$ to $\Upsilon(1S,2S,3S)\pi^+\pi^-$ in the final state rescattering model. Since the $\Upsilon(5S)$ is well above the open bottom thresholds, the dipion transitions are expected to mainly proceed through the real processes $\Upsilon(5S)\to B^{(*)}\bar{B}^{(*)}$ and $B^{(*)}\bar{B}^{(*)}\to \Upsilon(1S,2S,3S)\pi^+\pi^-$. We find that the energy distributions of $\Upsilon(1S,2S,3S)\pi^+\pi^-$ markedly differ from that of $\Upsilon(5S)\to B^{(*)}\bar{B}^{(*)}$. In particular, the resonance peak will be pushed up by about 7-20 MeV for these dipion transitions relative to the main hadronic decay modes. These predictions can be used to test the final state rescattering mechanism in hadronic transitions for heavy quarkonia above the open flavor thresholds. "
"Unwanted motion of the probe with respect to the sample is a ubiquitous problem in scanning probe microscopy, causing both linear and nonlinear artifacts in experimental images. We have designed a procedure to correct these artifacts by using orthogonal scan pairs to align each measurement line-by-line along the slow scan direction. We demonstrate the accuracy of our algorithm on both synthetic and experimental data and provide an implementation of our method. "
"In metallic samples of small enough size and sufficiently strong momentum-conserving scattering, the viscosity of the electron gas can become the dominant process governing transport. In this regime, momentum is a long-lived quantity whose evolution is described by an emergent hydrodynamical theory. Furthermore, breaking time-reversal symmetry leads to the appearance of an odd component to the viscosity called the Hall viscosity, which has attracted considerable attention recently due to its quantized nature in gapped systems but still eludes experimental confirmation. Based on microscopic calculations, we discuss how to measure the effects of both the even and odd components of the viscosity using hydrodynamic electronic transport in mesoscopic samples under applied magnetic fields. "
"We present a method for computing first order asymptotics of semiclassical spectra for 1-D Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) Hamiltonian from Supraconductivity, which models the electron/hole scattering through two SNS junctions. This involves: 1) reducing the system to Weber equation near the branching point at the junctions, 2) constructing local sections of the fibre bundle of microlocal solutions, 3) normalizing these solutions for the ""flux norm"" associated to the microlocal Wronskians, 4) finding the relative monodromy matrices in the gauge group that leaves invariant the flux norm, 5) from this we deduce Bohr-Sommerfeld (BS) quantization rules that hold precisely when the fibre bundle of microlocal solutions (depending on the energy parameter E) has trivial holonomy. Such a semi-classical treatement reveals interesting continuous symetries related to monodromy. "
"In this note, we show that the theory of tracial von Neumann algebras does not have a model companion. This will follow from the fact that the theory of any locally universal, McDuff II_1 factor does not have quantifier elimination. We also show how a positive solution to the Connes Embedding Problem implies that there can be no model-complete theory of II_1 factors. "
"Among the main actors of organism development there are morphogens, which are signaling molecules diffusing in the developing organism and acting on cells to produce local responses. Growth is thus determined by the distribution of such signal. Meanwhile, the diffusion of the signal is itself affected by the changes in shape and size of the organism. In other words, there is a complete coupling between the diffusion of the signal and the change of the shapes. In this paper, we introduce a mathematical model to investigate such coupling. The shape is given by a manifold, that varies in time as the result of a deformation given by a transport equation. The signal is represented by a density, diffusing on the manifold via a diffusion equation. We show the non-commutativity of the transport and diffusion evolution by introducing a new concept of Lie bracket between the diffusion and the transport operator. We also provide numerical simulations showing this phenomenon. "
"Recent experiments using innovative optical detectors and techniques have strongly increased the capacity of testing the violation of the Bell's inequalities in the Nature. Most of them have used the Eberhardt's inequality (EI) to close the ""detection"" loophole. Closing the ""locality"" loophole has been attempted by space-like separated detections and fast and random changes in the setting of the bases of observation. Also, pulsed pumping and time stamped data to close the ""time-coincidence"" loophole, and sophisticated statistical methods to close the ""memory"" loophole, have been used. In this paper, the meaning of the EI is reviewed. A simple hidden-variables theory based on a relaxation of the condition of ""measurement independence"", which was devised long ago for the Clauser-Horne-Shimony and Holt inequality, is adapted to the EI case. It is used here to evaluate the significance of the results of the new experiments, which are briefly described. A Table summarizes the main results. "
"We pursue Ginsparg and Wilsons' block spin approach in the derivation of the Ginsparg-Wilson relation and study the correspondence of the eigenmodes of the Dirac operators in the continuum and lattice theories. After introducing a suitable cut-off in the continuum theory, we identify unphysical modes of the lattice Dirac operator which do not correspond to any physical modes of the regulated continuum Dirac operator. We also consider zero modes in the continuum and lattice theories. Our studies give a physical interpretation of the expression of the index defined on a lattice and a formal argument on the relation of the indices between the continuum and lattice theories. "
"Star-disc coupling is considered in numerical models where the stellar field is not an imposed perfect dipole, but instead a more irregular self-adjusting dynamo-generated field. Using axisymmetric simulations of the hydromagnetic mean-field equations, it is shown that the resulting stellar field configuration is more complex, but significantly better suited for driving a stellar wind. In agreement with recent findings by a number of people, star-disc coupling is less efficient in braking the star than previously thought. Moreover, stellar wind braking becomes equally important. In contrast to a perfect stellar dipole field, dynamo-generated stellar fields favor field-aligned accretion with considerably higher velocity at low latitudes, where the field is weaker and originating in the disc. Accretion is no longer nearly periodic (as it is in the case of a stellar dipole), but it is more irregular and episodic. "
"Recent work in image processing suggests that operating on (overlapping) patches in an image may lead to state-of-the-art results. This has been demonstrated for a variety of problems including denoising, inpainting, deblurring, and super-resolution. The work reported in [1,2] takes an extra step forward by showing that ordering these patches to form an approximate shortest path can be leveraged for better processing. The core idea is to apply a simple filter on the resulting 1D smoothed signal obtained after the patch-permutation. This idea has been also explored in combination with a wavelet pyramid, leading eventually to a sophisticated and highly effective regularizer for inverse problems in imaging. In this work we further study the patch-permutation concept, and harness it to propose a new simple yet effective regularization for image restoration problems. Our approach builds on the classic Maximum A'posteriori probability (MAP), with a penalty function consisting of a regular log-likelihood term and a novel permutation-based regularization term. Using a plain 1D Laplacian, the proposed regularization forces robust smoothness (L1) on the permuted pixels. Since the permutation originates from patch-ordering, we propose to accumulate the smoothness terms over all the patches' pixels. Furthermore, we take into account the found distances between adjacent patches in the ordering, by weighting the Laplacian outcome. We demonstrate the proposed scheme on a diverse set of problems: (i) severe Poisson image denoising, (ii) Gaussian image denoising, (iii) image deblurring, and (iv) single image super-resolution. In all these cases, we use recent methods that handle these problems as initialization to our scheme. This is followed by an L-BFGS optimization of the above-described penalty function, leading to state-of-the-art results, and especially so for highly ill-posed cases. "
"Two colloidal particles, driven around an optical vortex trap, have been recently shown to pair due to an interplay between hydrodynamic interactions and the curved path they are forced to follow. We demonstrate here, that this pairing interaction can be tuned experimentally, and study its effect on the collective excitations of many particles driven around such an optical trap. We find that even though the system is overdamped, hydrodynamic interactions due to driving give rise to non-decaying excitations with characteristic dispersion relations. The collective excitations of the colloidal ring reflect fluctuations of particle pairs rather than those of single particles. "
"""El Abr\'on"" is a fossil deposit located in Pinar del Rio, Cuba, and whose age is only reference level VII (17 406 years BP), it is classified as the largest collection of fossils accumulated for our archipelago, produced by trophic action of barn owls for thousands of years. The aim of this study was to determine the living taxonomic composition of the fauna of extinct mammals, and throughout the paleontological study of the deeper level of said tank (Level IX). The extracted material which it is currently stored in the warehouse of paleontological collections of the National Museum of Natural History in Havana, Cuba (MNHNCu) was analyzed. We proceeded to clean the bones, to classify and to identify them from the species and also the taphonomic analysis of the condition of the remains. It was found that the mammal fauna of the paleontological deposit under study is composed essentially of 3 orders, 7 families and 14 species. The most significative order is Chiroptera (bat fauna), represented by 4 families, 9 genus and 9 species of the total which were identified. There were reported four species of bats Erophylla sezecorni, Monophyllus redmani, Pteronotus parnelli and Tadarida brasiliensis in the location. The results are the basis of the future paleoecological studies in order to reconstruct the natural history of these species. Moreover, the discovery of new species in this area is a contribution to the knowledge about the distribution of these species in the Cuban archipelago and the age of them. Finally, the taphonomic analysis of the conservation status of these remains permitted the understanding of the processes that gave rise to the tank and its characteristics, and also it contribute to an adequate estimation of the species present in it and the relationship between spatiotemporal with the fossil.

"Radio sources have traditionally provided convenient beacons for probing the early Universe. Hy Spinrad was among the first of the tenacious breed of observers who would attempt to obtain optical identifications and spectra of the faintest possible `radio galaxies' to investigate the formation and evolution of galaxies at hy redshift. Modern telescopes and instruments have made these tasks much simpler, although not easy, and here we summarize the current status of our hunts for hy redshift radio galaxies (HyZRGs) using radio spectral and near-IR selection. "
We present the analytical calculation in perturbative Quantum Chromodynamics of the (alpha_s)^3 contribution to the Ellis-Jaffe sum rule for the structure function g1 of polarized deep inelastic lepton-nucleon scattering.
"We consider the gravitational field of infinite straight and stationary twisted Baby Skyrmion cosmic string. Using the approximate solution of Einstein equations, it is shown that the internal phase rotation (twist) along the string axis is responsible for a long-range gravitational acceleration resembling that of massive cylindrical shell. We also study the stability and gravitational field of circular loops. When the loop radius becomes comparable with the string width, the rigidity energy tends to stabilize small loops against radial collapse. The nucleon scale-toroidal knot with Hopf charge Q=1 is found to decay very rapidly on the scale of the age of the universe due to low energy cost to flux lines crossings. Such knot is therefore excluded from the dark matter scenario of Spergel and Steinhardt. However, the Q = 0 loop, stabilized by rigidity, could be a candidate for this scenario. In contrast, the electroweak strings are prevented from intercommuting due to much larger energy cost to intersection. This makes them a possible candidate for the solid dark matter scenario of Bucher and Spergel. "
"Pseudospectra and structured pseudospectra are important tools for the analysis of matrices. Their computation, however, can be very demanding for all but small matrices. A new approach to compute approximations of pseudospectra and structured pseudospectra, based on determining the spectra of many suitably chosen rank-one or projected rank-one perturbations of the given matrix is proposed. The choice of rank-one or projected rank-one perturbations is inspired by Wilkinson's analysis of eigenvalue sensitivity. Numerical examples illustrate that the proposed approach gives much better insight into the pseudospectra and structured pseudospectra than random or structured random rank-one perturbations with lower computational burden. The latter approach is presently commonly used for the determination of structured pseudospectra. "
"We offer mathematical tractability and new insights for a framework of exponential utility with non-negative consumption, a constraint often omitted in the literature giving rise to economically unviable solutions. Specifically, using the Kuhn-Tucker theorem and the notion of aggregate state price density (Malamud and Trubowitz (2007)), we provide a solution to this problem in the setting of both complete and incomplete markets (with random endowments). Then, we exploit this result to provide an explicit characterization of complete market heterogeneous equilibria. Furthermore, we construct concrete examples of models admitting multiple (including infinitely many) equilibria. By using Cramer's large deviation theorem, we study the asymptotics of equilibrium zero coupon bonds. Lastly, we conduct a study of the precautionary savings motive in incomplete markets. "
"Two neural networks which are trained on their mutual output bits are analysed using methods of statistical physics. The exact solution of the dynamics of the two weight vectors shows a novel phenomenon: The networks synchronize to a state with identical time dependent weights. Extending the models to multilayer networks with discrete weights, it is shown how synchronization by mutual learning can be applied to secret key exchange over a public channel. "
"We extend our study of the optimization of large baryon acoustic oscillation (BAO) surveys to return the best constraints on the dark energy, building on Paper I of this series (Parkinson et al. 2007). The survey galaxies are assumed to be pre-selected active, star-forming galaxies observed by their line emission with a constant number density across the redshift bin. Star-forming galaxies have a redshift desert in the region 1.6 < z < 2, and so this redshift range was excluded from the analysis. We use the Seo & Eisenstein (2007) fitting formula for the accuracies of the BAO measurements, using only the information for the oscillatory part of the power spectrum as distance and expansion rate rulers. We go beyond our earlier analysis by examining the effect of including curvature on the optimal survey configuration and updating the expected `prior' constraints from Planck and SDSS. We once again find that the optimal survey strategy involves minimizing the exposure time and maximizing the survey area (within the instrumental constraints), and that all time should be spent observing in the low-redshift range (z<1.6) rather than beyond the redshift desert, z>2. We find that when assuming a flat universe the optimal survey makes measurements in the redshift range 0.1 < z <0.7, but that including curvature as a nuisance parameter requires us to push the maximum redshift to 1.35, to remove the degeneracy between curvature and evolving dark energy. The inclusion of expected other data sets (such as WiggleZ, BOSS and a stage III SN-Ia survey) removes the necessity of measurements below redshift 0.9, and pushes the maximum redshift up to 1.5. We discuss considerations in determining the best survey strategy in light of uncertainty in the true underlying cosmological model. "
"The lifted dynamic junction tree algorithm (LDJT) efficiently answers filtering and prediction queries for probabilistic relational temporal models by building and then reusing a first-order cluster representation of a knowledge base for multiple queries and time steps. We extend LDJT to (i) solve the smoothing inference problem to answer hindsight queries by introducing an efficient backward pass and (ii) discuss different options to instantiate a first-order cluster representation during a backward pass. Further, our relational forward backward algorithm makes hindsight queries to the very beginning feasible. LDJT answers multiple temporal queries faster than the static lifted junction tree algorithm on an unrolled model, which performs smoothing during message passing. "
"Ozsv\'ath and Szab\'o gave a combinatorial description for the Heegaard Floer homology of boundaries of certain negative-definite plumbings. N\'emethi constructed a remarkable algorithm for executing these computations for almost-rational plumbings, and his work gives a formula computing the invariants for the Brieskorn homology spheres -{\Sigma} (p,q,pqn + 1). Here we give a formula for HF^{+}(-{\Sigma}(p,q,pqn-1)), generalizing the one for the n=1 case given by Borodzik and N\'emethi. We also compute HF^{+} for the families -{\Sigma}(2,5,k) and -{\Sigma}(2,7,k). "
"We present the explicit de Sitter supergravity action describing the interaction of supergravity with an arbitrary number of chiral and vector multiplets as well as one nilpotent chiral multiplet. The action has a non-Gaussian dependence on the auxiliary field of the nilpotent multiplet, however, it can be integrated out for an arbitrary matter-coupled supergravity. The general supergravity action with a given Kahler potential $K$, superpotential $W$ and vector matrix $f_{AB}$ interacting with a nilpotent chiral multiplet consists of the standard supergravity action defined by $K$, $W$ and $f_{AB}$ where the scalar in the nilpotent multiplet has to be replaced by a bilinear combination of the fermion in the nilpotent multiplet divided by the Gaussian value of the auxiliary field. All additional contributions to the action start with terms quartic and higher order in the fermion of the nilpotent multiplet. These are given by a simple universal closed form expression. "
"Being motivated by the famous Kaplansky theorem we study various sequential properties of a Banach space $E$ and its closed unit ball $B$, both endowed with the weak topology of $E$. We show that $B$ has the Pytkeev property if and only if $E$ in the norm topology contains no isomorphic copy of $\ell_1$, while $E$ has the Pytkeev property if and only if it is finite-dimensional. We extend Schl\""uchtermann and Wheeler's result by showing that $B$ is a (separable) metrizable space if and only if it has countable $cs^\ast$-character and is a $k$-space. As a corollary we obtain that $B$ is Polish if and only if it has countable $cs^\ast$-character and is \v{C}ech-complete, that supplements a result of Edgar and Wheeler. "
"This paper presents infrared spectra taken with the newly commissioned NIRSPEC spectrograph on the Keck II Telescope of the High Redshift Radio Galaxy MRC 2025-218 (z=2.63) These observations represent the deepest infrared spectra of a radio galaxy to date and have allowed for the detection of Hbeta, [OIII] (4959/5007), [OI] (6300), Halpha, [NII] (6548/6583) and [SII] (6716/6713). The Halpha emission is very broad (FWHM = 9300 km/s) and luminous (2.6x10^44 ergs/s) and it is very comparable to the line widths and strengths of radio loud quasars at the same redshift. This strongly supports AGN unification models linking radio galaxies and quasars, although we discuss some of the outstanding differences. The [OIII] (5007) line is extremely strong and has extended emission with large relative velocities to the nucleus. We also derive that if the extended emission is due to star formation, each knot has a star formation rate comparable to a Lyman Break Galaxy at the same redshift. "
"Hadron production has been measured at mid-rapidity by the ALICE experiment at the LHC in proton-lead (p-Pb) collisions at $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}$ = 5.02 TeV. The transverse momentum ($p_{\rm T}$) distribution of primary charged particles and of identified light-flavoured hadrons ($\pi^{\pm}$, K$^{\pm}$, K$^{0}_{\rm S}$, p, $\bar{\rm p}$, $\Lambda$, $\bar{\Lambda}$) are presented in this report. Charged-particle tracks are reconstructed in the central barrel over a wide momentum range. Furthermore they can be identified by exploiting specific energy loss (d$E$/d$x$), time-of-flight and topological particle-identification techniques. Particle-production yields, spectral shapes and particle ratios are measured in several multiplicity classes and are compared with results obtained in Pb-Pb collisions at the LHC. The measurement of charged-particle transverse momentum spectra and nuclear modification factor R$_{\rm pPb}$ indicates that the strong suppression of high-$p_{\rm T}$ hadrons observed in Pb-Pb collisions is not due to initial-state effects, but it is rather a fingerprint of jet quenching in hot QCD matter. The systematic study of the hadronic spectral shapes as a function of the particle mass and of particle ratios as a function of charged-particle density provides insights into collective phenomena, as observed in Pb-Pb collisions. Similar features, that could be present in high-multiplicity p-Pb collisions, will also be discussed. "
"New Dirac points appear when periodic potentials are applied to graphene, and there are many interesting effects near these new Dirac points. Here we investigate the $\textit{Zitterbewegung}$ effect of fermions described by a Gaussian wave packet in graphene superlattice near new Dirac points. The $\textit{Zitterbewegung}$ near different Dirac points has similar characteristics, while Fermions near new Dirac points have different group velocities in both $x$- and $y$-direction, which causes the different properties of the $\textit{Zitterbewegung}$ near new Dirac points. We also investigate the $\textit{Zitterbewegung}$ effect influenced by all Dirac points, and get the evolution with changing potential. Our intensive results suggest that graphene superlattice may provide an appropriate system to study $\textit{Zitterbewegung}$ effect near new Dirac points experimentally. "
"We study diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) of electrons in non-relativistic quasi-perpendicular shocks using self-consistent one-dimensional particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations. By exploring the parameter space of sonic and Alfv\'{e}nic Mach numbers we find that high Mach number quasi-perpendicular shocks can efficiently accelerate electrons to power-law downstream spectra with slopes consistent with DSA prediction. Electrons are reflected by magnetic mirroring at the shock and drive non-resonant waves in the upstream. Reflected electrons are trapped between the shock front and upstream waves and undergo multiple cycles of shock drift acceleration before the injection into DSA. Strong current-driven waves also temporarily change the shock obliquity and cause mild proton pre-acceleration even in quasi-perpendicular shocks, which otherwise do not accelerate protons. These results can be used to understand nonthermal emission in supernova remnants and intracluster medium in galaxy clusters. "
"Correlation functions $C(t) \sim <\phi(t)\phi(0)>$ in ohmically damped systems such as coupled harmonic oscillators or optical resonators can be expressed as a single sum over modes $j$ (which are not power-orthogonal), with each term multiplied by the Petermann factor (PF) $C_j$, leading to ""excess noise"" when $|C_j| > 1$. It is shown that $|C_j| > 1$ is common rather than exceptional, that $|C_j|$ can be large even for weak damping, and that the PF appears in other processes as well: for example, a time-independent perturbation $\sim\ep$ leads to a frequency shift $\sim \ep C_j$. The coalescence of $J$ ($>1$) eigenvectors gives rise to a critical point, which exhibits ""giant excess noise"" ($C_j \to \infty$). At critical points, the divergent parts of $J$ contributions to $C(t)$ cancel, while time-independent perturbations lead to non-analytic shifts $\sim \ep^{1/J}$. "
"This paper deals with the time evolution in the matter era of perturbations in Friedman-Lemaitre models with arbitrary density parameter $\Omega$, with either a zero cosmological constant, $\Lambda = 0$, or with a non-zero cosmological constant in a spatially flat Universe. Unlike the classical Eulerian approach where the density contrast is expanded in a perturbative series, this analysis relies instead on a perturbative expansion of particles trajectories in Lagrangian coordinates. This brings a number of advantages over the classical analysis. In particular, it enables the description of stronger density contrasts. Indeed the linear term is the famous Zel'dovich approximate solution (1970). We present here a systematic and detailed account of this approach. We give analytical results (or fits to numerical results) up to the third order. We then proceed to explore the link between the lagrangian description and statistical measures. We show in particular that Lagrangian perturbation theory provides a natural framework to compute the effect of redshift distortions, using the skewness of the density distribution function as an example. Finally, we show how well the second order theory does as compared to other approximat- ions in the case of spherically symmetric perturbations. We also compare this second order approximation and Zel'dovich solution to N-body simulations in the description of large-scale structure formation starting from a power law (n=-2) power spectrum of Gaussian perturbation. We find that second order theory is both simple and powerful. "
"We present first results from a Keck/DEIMOS spectroscopic survey of red giant branch (RGB) stars in M33. The radial velocity distributions of the stars in our fields are well described by three Gaussian components, corresponding to a candidate halo component with an uncorrected radial velocity dispersion of sigma ~ 50km/s, a candidate disk component with a dispersion sigma ~ 16km/s, and a third component offset from the disk by ~ 50km/s, but for which the dispersion is not well constrained. By comparing our data to a model of M33 based upon its HI rotation curve, we find that the stellar disk is offset in velocity by ~ 25km/s from the HI disk, consistent with the warping which exists between these components. The spectroscopic metallicity of the halo component is [Fe/H] ~ -1.5, significantly more metal-poor than the implied metallicity of the disk population ([Fe/H] ~ -0.9), which also has a broader colour dispersion than the halo population. These data represent the first detections of individual stars in the halo of M33 and, despite being ~ 10 times less massive than M31 or the Milky Way, all three of these disk galaxies have stellar halo components with a similar metallicity. The color distribution of the third component is different to the disk and the halo, but is similar to that expected for a single, coeval, stellar population, and could represent a stellar stream. More observations are required to determine the true nature of this intriguing third kinematic component in M33. "
"We investigate the flow properties of a two-dimensional aqueous foam submitted to a quasistatic shear in a Couette geometry. A strong localization of the flow (shear banding) at the edge of the moving wall is evidenced, characterized by an exponential decay of the average tangential velocity. Moreover, the analysis of the rapid velocity fluctuations reveals self-similar dynamical structures consisting of clusters of bubbles rolling as rigid bodies. To relate the instantaneous (elastic) and time-averaged (plastic) components of the strain, we develop a stochastic model where irreversible rearrangements are activated by local stress fluctuations originating from the rubbing of the wall. This model gives a complete description of our observations and is also consistent with data obtained on granular shear bands by other groups. "
"This is a continuation of a series of papers studying the birational Mori fiber structures of anticanonically embedded $\mathbb{Q}$-Fano $3$-fold weighted complete intersections of codimension $2$. We have proved that $19$ families consists of birationally rigid varieties and $14$ families consists of birationally birigid varieties. The aim of this paper is to continue the work systematically and prove that, among the remaining $52$ families, $21$ families consist of birationally birigid varieties. "
"We describe the algorithm used to select the Luminous Red Galaxy (LRG) sample for the extended Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (eBOSS) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey IV (SDSS-IV) using photometric data from both the SDSS and the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). LRG targets are required to meet a set of color selection criteria and have z-band and i-band MODEL magnitudes z < 19.95 and 19.9 < i < 21.8, respectively. Our algorithm selects roughly 50 LRG targets per square degree, the great majority of which lie in the redshift range 0.6 < z < 1.0 (median redshift 0.71). We demonstrate that our methods are highly effective at eliminating stellar contamination and lower-redshift galaxies. We perform a number of tests using spectroscopic data from SDSS-III/BOSS to determine the redshift reliability of our target selection and its ability to meet the science requirements of eBOSS. The SDSS spectra are of high enough signal-to-noise ratio that at least 89% of the target sample yields secure redshift measurements. We also present tests of the uniformity and homogeneity of the sample, demonstrating that it should be clean enough for studies of the large-scale structure of the universe at higher redshifts than SDSS-III/BOSS LRGs reached. "
"We compute the high-frequency emission and absorption noise in a fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) sample at arbitrary temperature. We model the edges of the FQHE as chiral Luttinger liquids (LL) and we use the non-equilibrium perturbative Keldysh formalism. We find that the non-symmetrized high frequency noise contains important signatures of the electron-electron interactions that can be used to test the Luttinger liquid physics, not only in FQHE edge states, but possibly also in other one-dimensional systems such as carbon nanotubes. In particular we find that the emission and absorption components of the excess noise (defined as the difference between the noise at finite voltage and at zero voltage) are different in an interacting system, as opposed to the non-interacting case when they are identical. We study the resonance features which appear in the noise at the Josephson frequency (proportional to the applied voltage), and we also analyze the effect of the distance between the measurement point and the backscattering site. Most of our analysis is performed in the weak backscattering limit, but we also compute and discuss briefly the high-frequency noise in the tunneling regime. "
"The Adaptive Metropolis (AM) algorithm is based on the symmetric random-walk Metropolis algorithm. The proposal distribution has the following time-dependent covariance matrix at step $n+1$ \[ S_n = Cov(X_1,...,X_n) + \epsilon I, \] that is, the sample covariance matrix of the history of the chain plus a (small) constant $\epsilon>0$ multiple of the identity matrix $I$. The lower bound on the eigenvalues of $S_n$ induced by the factor $\epsilon I$ is theoretically convenient, but practically cumbersome, as a good value for the parameter $\epsilon$ may not always be easy to choose. This article considers variants of the AM algorithm that do not explicitly bound the eigenvalues of $S_n$ away from zero. The behaviour of $S_n$ is studied in detail, indicating that the eigenvalues of $S_n$ do not tend to collapse to zero in general. "
"Let $p$ be a prime. We discuss $p$-adic properties of various arithmetical functions related to the coefficients of modular form and generating functions. Modular forms are considered as a tool of solving arithmetical problems. Examples of congruences between modular forms modulo $p$ and modulo $p^n$ are given, and the use of a computer for the study of modular forms is illistrated. "
"We describe a theory of Mn local-moment magnetization relaxation due to p-d kinetic-exchange coupling with the itinerant-spin subsystem in the ferromagnetic semiconductor (Ga,Mn)As alloy. The theoretical Gilbert damping coefficient implied by this mechanism is calculated as a function of Mn moment density, hole concentration, and quasiparticle lifetime. Comparison with experimental ferromagnetic resonance data suggests that in annealed strongly metallic samples, p-d coupling contributes significantly to the damping rate of the magnetization precession at low temperatures. By combining the theoretical Gilbert coefficient with the values of the magnetic anisotropy energy, we estimate that the typical critical current for spin-transfer magnetization switching in all-semiconductor trilayer devices can be as low as $\sim 10^{5} {\rm A cm}^{-2}$. "
"In this work we study the theory of linearized gravity via the Hamilton-Jacobi formalism. We make a brief review of this theory and its Lagrangian description, as well as a review of the Hamilton-Jacobi approach for singular systems. Then we apply this formalism to analyze the constraint structure of the linearized gravity in instant and front-form dynamics. "
"The paper is devoted to the study of Gamma white noise analysis. We define an extended Fock space $\Gama(\Ha)$ over $\Ha=L^2(\R^d, d\sigma)$, and show how to include the usual Fock space ${\cal F} (\Ha)$ in it as a subspace. We introduce in $\Gama(\Ha)$ operators $a(\xi)=\int_{\R^d} dx \xi(x)a(x)$, $\xi\in S$, with $a(x)=\dig_x+2\dig_x\di_x+1+\di_x +\dig_x\di_x\di_x$, where $\dig_x$ and $\di_x$ are the creation and annihilation operators at $x$. We show that $(a(\xi))_{\xi\in S}$ is a family of commuting selfadjoint operators in $\Gama(\Ha)$ and construct the Fourier transform in generalized joint eigenvectors of this family. This transform is a unitary $I$ between $\Gama(\Ha)$ and the $L^2$-space $L^2(S',d\mu_{\mathrm G})$, where $\mu_{\mathrm G}$ is the measure of Gamma white noise with intensity $\sigma$. The image of $a(\xi)$ under $I$ is the operator of multiplication by $\la\cdot,\xi\ra$, so that $a(\xi)$'s are Gamma field operators. The Fock structure of the Gamma space determined by $I$ coincides with that discovered in {\bf [}{\it Infinite Dimensional Analysis, Quantum Probability and Related Topics} {\bf 1} (1998), 91--117{\bf ]}. We note that $I$ extends in a natural way the multiple stochastic integral (chaos) decomposition of the ``chaotic'' subspace of the Gamma space. Next, we introduce and study spaces of test and generalized functions of Gamma white noise and derive explicit formulas for the action of the creation, neutral, and Gamma annihilation operators on these spaces. "
"The Greenberger, Horne, Zeilinger (GHZ) theorem is critically important to consideration of the possibility of hidden variables in quantum mechanics. Since it depends on predictions of single sets of measurements on three particles, it eliminates the sampling loophole encountered by the Bell theorem which requires a large number of observations to obtain a small number of useful joint measurements. In evading this problem, the GHZ theorem is believed to have confirmed Bell's historic conclusion that local hidden variables are inconsistent with the results of quantum mechanics. The GHZ theorem depends on predicting the results of sets of measurements of which only one may be performed, i.e., counterfactuals. In the present paper, the non-commutative aspects of these unperformed measurement sequences are critically examined. Three classical examples and two variations on the GHZ construction are analyzed to demonstrate that combined counter factual results of non-commuting operations are in general logically inconsistent with performable measurement sequences that take non-commutation into account. As a consequence, negative conclusions regarding local hidden variables do not follow from the GHZ and Bell theorems as historically reasoned. "
"Historian Herbert Mehrtens sought to portray the history of turn-of-the-century mathematics as a struggle of modern vs countermodern, led respectively by David Hilbert and Felix Klein. Some of Mehrtens' conclusions have been picked up by both historians (Jeremy Gray) and mathematicians (Frank Quinn). We argue that Klein and Hilbert, both at Goettingen, were not adversaries but rather modernist allies in a bid to broaden the scope of mathematics beyond a narrow focus on arithmetized analysis as practiced by the Berlin school. Klein's Goettingen lecture and other texts shed light on Klein's modernism. Hilbert's views on intuition are closer to Klein's views than Mehrtens is willing to allow. Klein and Hilbert were equally interested in the axiomatisation of physics. Among Klein's credits is helping launch the career of Abraham Fraenkel, and advancing the careers of Sophus Lie, Emmy Noether, and Ernst Zermelo, all four surely of impeccable modernist credentials. Mehrtens' unsourced claim that Hilbert was interested in production rather than meaning appears to stem from Mehrtens' marxist leanings. Mehrtens' claim that [the future SS-Brigadefuehrer] ""Theodor Vahlen ... cited Klein's racist distinctions within mathematics, and sharpened them into open antisemitism"" fabricates a spurious continuity between the two figures mentioned and is thus an odious misrepresentation of Klein's position. Keywords: arithmetized analysis; axiomatisation of geometry; axiomatisation of physics; formalism; intuition; mathematical realism; modernism; Felix Klein; David Hilbert; Karl Weierstrass "
"We apply the new dynamics of 3-space to cosmology by deriving a Hubble expansion solution. This dynamics involves two constants; G and alpha - the fine structure constant. This solution gives an excellent parameter-free fit to the recent supernova and gamma-ray burst data without the need for `dark energy' or `dark matter'. The data and theory together imply an older age for the universe of some 14.7Gyrs. Various problems such as fine tuning, the event horizon problem etc are now resolved. A brief review discusses the origin of the 3-space dynamics and how that dynamics explained the bore hole anomaly, spiral galaxy flat rotation speeds, the masses of black holes in spherical galaxies, gravitational light bending and lensing, all without invoking `dark matter' or `dark energy'. These developments imply that a new understanding of the universe is now available. "
"Prediction of new drug-target interactions is extremely important as it can lead the researchers to find new uses for old drugs and to realize the therapeutic profiles or side effects thereof. However, experimental prediction of drug-target interactions is expensive and time-consuming. As a result, computational methods for prediction of new drug-target interactions have gained much interest in recent times. We present iDTI-ESBoost, a prediction model for identification of drug-target interactions using evolutionary and structural features. Our proposed method uses a novel balancing technique and a boosting technique for the binary classification problem of drug-target interaction. On four benchmark datasets taken from a gold standard data, iDTI-ESBoost outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in terms of area under Receiver operating characteristic (auROC) curve. iDTI-ESBoost also outperforms the latest and the best-performing method in the literature to-date in terms of area under precision recall (auPR) curve. This is significant as auPR curves are argued to be more appropriate as a metric for comparison for imbalanced datasets, like the one studied in this research. In the sequel, our experiments establish the effectiveness of the classifier, balancing methods and the novel features incorporated in iDTI-ESBoost. iDTI-ESBoost is a novel prediction method that has for the first time exploited the structural features along with the evolutionary features to predict drug-protein interactions. We believe the excellent performance of iDTI-ESBoost both in terms of auROC and auPR would motivate the researchers and practitioners to use it to predict drug-target interactions. To facilitate that, iDTI-ESBoost is readily available for use at: http://farshidrayhan.pythonanywhere.com/iDTI-ESBoost/ "
"Understanding temperature-dependent hardness of covalent materials is not only of fundamental scientific interest, but also of crucial importance for technical applications. In this work, a temperature-dependent hardness formula for diamond-structured covalent materials is constructed on the basis of the dislocation theory. Our results show that, at low temperature, the Vickers hardness is mainly controlled by Poisson's ratio and shear modulus with the latter playing a dominant role. With increasing temperature, the plastic deformation mechanism undergoes a transition from shuffle-set dislocation control to glide-set dislocation control, leading to a steeper drop of hardness at high temperature. In addition, an intrinsic parameter, a3G, is revealed for diamond-structured covalent materials, which measures the resistance to soften at high temperature. Our hardness model shows remarkable agreement with experimental data. Current work not only sheds lights on the physical origin of hardness, but also provides a direct principle for superhard materials design. "
"The no-longer-eclipsing system SS Lac in the young open cluster NGC 7209 has been recently announced to show a constant radial velocity. Puzzled by this finding, we have monitored the system during 1997 obtaining 24 Echelle+CCD spectra over 8 orbital revolutions. Our spectra reveal a nice orbital motion with periodic splitting and merging of spectral lines from both components. An accurate orbit has been derived, together with individual masses of the stars. SS Lac presents a moderately eccentric orbit and a probably full synchronization between stellar rotation and orbital revolution. "
"The forward and backward scattering off linear systems with discrete rotational symmetries R_z (2{\pi} /n) with n $\ge$ 3 are shown to be restricted by symmetry reasons. Along the symmetry axis, forward scattering can only be helicity preserving and backward scattering can only be helicity flipping. These restrictions do not exist for n < 3. If, in addition to the n $\ge$ 3 discrete rotational symmetry, the system has duality symmetry (obeys the helicity conservation law), it will exhibit zero backscattering. The results pinpoint the underlying symmetry reasons for some notable scattering properties of R_z (2{\pi} /4) symmetric systems that have been reported in the metamaterials and radar literature. Applications to planar metamaterials and solar cells are briefly discussed. "
"Cross sections resulting from scattering that proceeds via an intermediate resonance are shown to be exceptionally controllable using a coherent superposition of only two intial states. Full quantum computations on F+HD(v=0;j=0,1) --> H+DF, D+HF, which exhibits a resonance in one of the reactive channels, support the formal arguments, showing that control is indeed vast. In this case the ratio of reactive integral cross sections can be altered by a factor of 62 (compared to a noncoherent factor of only 3.3), while the ratio of reactive differential cross sections can be altered by a factor of over 6000 (compared to a noncoherent factor of less than 7). These results constitute the first prediction of extensive quantum control in a collisional process. "
"Network embedding assigns nodes in a network to low-dimensional representations and effectively preserves the network structure. Recently, a significant amount of progresses have been made toward this emerging network analysis paradigm. In this survey, we focus on categorizing and then reviewing the current development on network embedding methods, and point out its future research directions. We first summarize the motivation of network embedding. We discuss the classical graph embedding algorithms and their relationship with network embedding. Afterwards and primarily, we provide a comprehensive overview of a large number of network embedding methods in a systematic manner, covering the structure- and property-preserving network embedding methods, the network embedding methods with side information and the advanced information preserving network embedding methods. Moreover, several evaluation approaches for network embedding and some useful online resources, including the network data sets and softwares, are reviewed, too. Finally, we discuss the framework of exploiting these network embedding methods to build an effective system and point out some potential future directions. "
"Using the exact Bose-Fermi mapping, we study universal properties of ground-state density distributions and finite-temperature quantum critical behavior of one-dimensional hard-core bosons in trapped incommensurate optical lattices. Through the analysis of universal scaling relations in the quantum critical regime, we demonstrate that the superfluid to Bose glass transition and the general phase diagram of disordered hard-core bosons can be uniquely determined from finite-temperature density distributions of the trapped disordered system. "
"We compute the large N limit of Wilson loop expectation values for a broad class of N=2 supersymmetric gauge theories defined on a general class of background three-manifolds M_3, diffeomorphic to S^3. We find a simple closed formula which depends on the background geometry only through a certain supersymmetric Killing vector field. The supergravity dual of such a Wilson loop is an M2-brane wrapping the M-theory circle, together with a complex curve in a self-dual Einstein manifold M_4, whose conformal boundary is M_3. We show that the regularized action of this M2-brane also depends only on the supersymmetric Killing vector, precisely reproducing the large N field theory computation. "
"The generation and evolution of astrophysical magnetic fields occurs largely through the action of turbulence. In many situations, the magnetic field is strong enough to influence many important properties of turbulence itself. Numerical simulation of magnetized turbulence is especially challenging in the astrophysical regime because of the high magnetic Reynolds numbers involved, but some aspects of this difficulty can be avoided in weakly ionized systems. "
"The evolution of pressure induced superconductivity in single crystal as well as polycrystalline samples of BaFe2As2 has been investigated through temperature dependent electrical resistivity studies in 0-7 GPa pressure range. While the superconducting transition remains incomplete in polycrystalline sample, a clear pressure induced superconductivity with zero resistivity at the expense of magnetic transition, associated with spin density wave (SDW), is observed in the single crystal sample. The superconducting transition temperature (TC) is seen to increase upto a moderate pressure of about ~1.5 GPa and decreases monotonically beyond this pressure. The SDW transition temperature TSDW decreases rapidly with increasing pressure and vanishes above ~1.5 GPa. "
"The ATLAS liquid argon calorimeter has been operating continuously since August 2006. At this time, only part of the calorimeter was readout, but since the beginning of 2008, all calorimeter cells have been connected to the ATLAS readout system in preparation for LHC collisions. This paper gives an overview of the liquid argon calorimeter performance measured in situ with random triggers, calibration data, cosmic muons, and LHC beam splash events. Results on the detector operation, timing performance, electronics noise, and gain stability are presented. High energy deposits from radiative cosmic muons and beam splash events allow to check the intrinsic constant term of the energy resolution. The uniformity of the electromagnetic barrel calorimeter response along eta (averaged over phi) is measured at the percent level using minimum ionizing cosmic muons. Finally, studies of electromagnetic showers from radiative muons have been used to cross-check the Monte Carlo simulation. The performance results obtained using the ATLAS readout, data acquisition, and reconstruction software indicate that the liquid argon calorimeter is well-prepared for collisions at the dawn of the LHC era. "
"It has been recently pointed out, that nonlocal Nambu--Jona-Lasinio models, may present unphysical thermodynamical behavior like negative pressure and oscillating entropy. Here we show how these thermodynamic instabilities can be related to the analytical structure of the poles of the quark propagator in the model. The analysis is carried out for two different regulators and we show, in each case, how the instabilities are related to the pressence of highly unstable poles. We also argue that the softening of these instabilities by the inclusion of the Polyakov loop is related to the effect the latter has on the poles of the propagator. "
"We study jets of massless particles in N=4 super Yang-Mills using the AdS/CFT correspondence both at zero and finite temperature. We set up an initial state corresponding to a highly energetic quark/anti-quark pair and follow its time evolution into two jets. At finite temperature the jets stop after traveling a finite distance, whereas at zero temperature they travel and spread forever. We map out the corresponding baryon number charge density and identify the generic late time behavior of the jets as well as features that depend crucially on the initial conditions. "
"Previously developed method for finding asymptotic solutions of Vlasov equations using two-dimensional (in coordinate x and time t) Laplace transform is applied to low-collision electron-ion plasmas. Taking into account Coulomb collisions in the limit m_e << m_i, \bar{v_i} << \bar{v_e}, and T_e m_e << T_i m_i, results in the expression for longitudinal high-frequency plasma-electron oscillation/wave decrement essentially depending on oscillation frequency \omega. This expression is quite different from the used one for low-frequency plasma sound, which can be derived using expansion in asymptotically divergent series in \delta/\omega_0, k v_i/\omega_0, where \delta is imaginary part of the frequency \omega=\omega_0+i\delta, and does not reduce to simple expression with some collision frequency \delta\sim\nu^{eff}_{e_i}. "
"Gauge boson self-couplings are exactly determined by the non-Abelian gauge nature of the Standard Model (SM), thus precision measurements of these couplings at the LHC provide an important opportunity to test the gauge structure of the SM and the spontaneous symmetry breaking mechanism. It is a common way to examine the physics of anomalous quartic gauge boson couplings via effective Lagrangian method. In this work, we investigate the potential of the process $pp\rightarrow p\gamma p\rightarrow p W Z q X$ to analyze anomalous quartic $WWZ\gamma$ couplings by two different CP-violating and CP-conserving effective Lagrangians at the LHC. We calculate $95\%$ confidence level limits on the anomalous coupling parameters with various values of the integrated luminosity. Our numerical results show that the best limits obtained on the anomalous couplings $\frac{k_{0}^{W}}{\Lambda^{2}}$, $\frac{k_{c}^{W}}{\Lambda^{2}}$, $\frac{k_{2}^{m}}{\Lambda^{2}}$ and $\frac{a_{n}}{\Lambda^{2}}$ at $\sqrt{s}=14$ TeV and an integrated luminosity of $L_{int}=100$ fb$^{-1}$ are $[-1.37;\, 1.37]\times 10^{-6}$ GeV$^{-2}$, $[-1.88; \, 1.88]\times 10^{-6}$ GeV$^{-2}$, $[-6.55; \, 6.55]\times 10^{-7}$ GeV$^{-2}$ and $[-2.21;\,2.21]\times 10^{-6}$ GeV$^{-2}$, respectively. Thus, $\gamma p$ mode of photon-induced reactions at the LHC highly improves the sensitivity limits of the anomalous coupling parameters $\frac{k_{0}^{W}}{\Lambda^{2}}$, $\frac{k_{c}^{W}}{\Lambda^{2}}$, $\frac{k_{2}^{m}}{\Lambda^{2}}$ and $\frac{a_{n}}{\Lambda^{2}}$. "
"We elaborate on a previous proposal by Hartman and Maldacena on a tensor network which accounts for the scaling of the entanglement entropy in a system at a finite temperature. In this construction, the ordinary entanglement renormalization flow given by the class of tensor networks known as the Multi Scale Entanglement Renormalization Ansatz (MERA), is supplemented by an additional entanglement structure at the length scale fixed by the temperature. The network comprises two copies of a MERA circuit with a fixed number of layers and a pure matrix product state which joins both copies by entangling the infrared degrees of freedom of both MERA networks. The entanglement distribution within this bridge state defines reduced density operators on both sides which cause analogous effects to the presence of a black hole horizon when computing the entanglement entropy at finite temperature in the AdS/CFT correspondence. The entanglement and correlations during the thermalization process of a system after a quantum quench are also analyzed. To this end, a full tensor network representation of the action of local unitary operations on the bridge state is proposed. This amounts to a tensor network which grows in size by adding succesive layers of bridge states. Finally, we discuss on the holographic interpretation of the tensor network through a notion of distance within the network which emerges from its entanglement distribution. "
Using the world-line method we resum the scalar one-loop effective action. This is based on an exact expression for the one-loop action obtained for a background potential and a Taylor expansion of the potential up to quadratic order in x-space. We thus reproduce results of Masso and Rota very economically. An alternative resummation scheme is suggested using ``center of mass'' based loops which is equivalent under the assumption of vanishing third and higher derivatives in the Taylor expansion but leads to simplified expressions. In an appendix some general issues concerning the relation between world-line integrals with fixed end points versus integrals with fixed center are clarified. We finally note that this method is also very valuable for gauge field effective actions where it is based on the Euler--Heisenberg type resummation.
"Isotropic soft-core potentials with two characteristic length scales have been used since 40 years to describe systems with polymorphism. In the recent years intense research is showing that these potentials also display polyamorphism and several anomalies, including structural, diffusion and density anomaly. These anomalies occur in a hierarchy that resembles the anomalies of water. However, the absence of directional bonding in these isotropic potentials makes them different from water. Other systems, such as colloidal suspensions, protein solutions or liquid metals, can be well described by these family of potentials, opening the possibility of studying the mechanism generating the polyamorphism and anomalies in these complex liquids. "
"If the 750 GeV resonance in the diphoton channel is confirmed, what are the measurements necessary to infer the properties of the new particle and understand its nature? We address this question in the framework of a single new scalar particle, called digamma ($\digamma$). We describe it by an effective field theory, which allows us to obtain general and model-independent results, and to identify the most useful observables, whose relevance will remain also in model-by-model analyses. We derive full expressions for the leading-order processes and compute rates for higher-order decays, digamma production in association with jets, gauge or Higgs bosons, and digamma pair production. We illustrate how measurements of these higher-order processes can be used to extract couplings, quantum numbers, and properties of the new particle. "
"We extend the nonequilibrium dynamical mean field (DMFT) formalism to inhomogeneous systems by adapting the ""real-space"" DMFT method to Keldysh Green's functions. Solving the coupled impurity problems using strong-coupling perturbation theory, we apply the formalism to homogeneous and inhomogeneous layered systems with strong local interactions and up to 39 layers. We study the diffusion of doublons and holes created by photo-excitation in a Mott insulating system, the time-dependent build-up of the polarization and the current induced by a linear voltage bias across a multi-layer structure, and the photo-induced current in a Mott insulator under bias. "
"Reasoning based on causality, instead of association has been considered as a key ingredient towards real machine intelligence. However, it is a challenging task to infer causal relationship/structure among variables. In recent years, an Independent Mechanism (IM) principle was proposed, stating that the mechanism generating the cause and the one mapping the cause to the effect are independent. As the conjecture, it is argued that in the causal direction, the conditional distributions instantiated at different value of the conditioning variable have less variation than the anti-causal direction. Existing state-of-the-arts simply compare the variance of the RKHS mean embedding norms of these conditional distributions. In this paper, we prove that this norm-based approach sacrifices important information of the original conditional distributions. We propose a Kernel Intrinsic Invariance Measure (KIIM) to capture higher order statistics corresponding to the shapes of the density functions. We show our algorithm can be reduced to an eigen-decomposition task on a kernel matrix measuring intrinsic deviance/invariance. Causal directions can then be inferred by comparing the KIIM scores of two hypothetic directions. Experiments on synthetic and real data are conducted to show the advantages of our methods over existing solutions. "
"Inference algorithms for arbitrary belief networks are impractical for large, complex belief networks. Inference algorithms for specialized classes of belief networks have been shown to be more efficient. In this paper, we present a search-based algorithm for approximate inference on arbitrary, noisy-OR belief networks, generalizing earlier work on search-based inference for two-level, noisy-OR belief networks. Initial experimental results appear promising. "
"Few-body physics has played a prominent role in atomic, molecular and nuclear physics since the early days of quantum mechanics. It is now possible---thanks to tremendous progress in cooling, trapping, and manipulating ultracold samples---to experimentally study few-body phenomena in trapped atomic and molecular systems with unprecedented control. This review summarizes recent studies of few-body phenomena in trapped atomic and molecular gases, with an emphasis on small trapped systems. We start by introducing the free-space scattering properties and then investigate what happens when two particles, bosons or fermions, are placed in an external confinement. Next, various three-body systems are treated analytically in limiting cases. Our current understanding of larger two-component Fermi systems and Bose systems is reviewed, and connections with the corresponding bulk systems are established. Lastly, future prospects and challenges are discussed. Throughout this review, commonalities with other systems such as nuclei or quantum dots are highlighted. "
"We introduce and discuss a hybrid quantum-mechanics molecular-mechanics (QM-MM) approach for Car-Parrinello DFT simulations with pseudopotentials and planewaves basis, designed for the treatment of periodic systems. In this implementation the MM atoms are considered as additional QM ions having fractional charges of either sign, which provides conceptual and computational simplicity by exploiting the machinery already existing in planewave codes to deal with electrostatics in periodic boundary conditions. With this strategy, both the QM and MM regions are contained in the same supercell, which determines the periodicity for the whole system. Thus, while this method is not meant to compete with non-periodic QM-MM schemes able to handle extremely large but finite MM regions, it is shown that for periodic systems of a few hundred atoms, our approach provides substantial savings in computational times by treating classically a fraction of the particles. The performance and accuracy of the method is assessed through the study of energetic, structural, and dynamical aspects of the water dimer and of the aqueous bulk phase. Finally, the QM-MM scheme is applied to the computation of the vibrational spectra of water layers adsorbed at the TiO$_2$ anatase (101) solid-liquid interface. This investigation suggests that the inclusion of a second monolayer of H$_2$O molecules is sufficient to induce on the first adsorbed layer, a vibrational dynamics similar to that taking place in the presence of an aqueous environment. The present QM-MM scheme appears as a very interesting tool to efficiently perform molecular dynamics simulations of complex condensed matter systems, from solutions to nanoconfined fluids to different kind of interfaces.

"Search-based motion planning has been used for mobile robots in many applications. However, it has not been fully developed and applied for planning full state trajectories of Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) due to their complicated dynamics and the requirement of real-time computation. In this paper, we explore a search-based motion planning framework that plans dynamically feasible, collision-free, and resolution optimal and complete trajectories. This paper extends the search-based planning approach to address three important scenarios for MAVs navigation: (i) planning safe trajectories in the presence of motion uncertainty; (ii) planning with constraints on field-of-view and (iii) planning in dynamic environments. We show that these problems can be solved effectively and efficiently using the proposed search-based planning with motion primitives. "
"The surface abundances of extreme helium (EHe) and R Coronae Borealis (RCB) stars are discussed in terms of the merger of a carbon-oxygen white dwarf with a helium white dwarf. The model is expressed as a linear mixture of the individual layers of both constituent white dwarfs, taking account of the specific evolution of each star. In developing this recipe from previous versions, particular attention has been given to the inter-shell abundances of the asymptotic giant branch star which evolved to become the carbon-oxygen white dwarf. Thus the surface composition of the merged star is estimated as a function of the initial mass and metallicity of its progenitor. The question of whether additional nucleosynthesis occurs during the white dwarf merger has been examined. The high observed abundances of carbon and oxygen must either originate by dredge-up from the core of the carbon-oxygen white dwarf during a cold merger or be generated directly by alpha-burning during a hot merger. The presence of large quantities of O18 may be consistent with both scenarios, since a significant O18 pocket develops at the carbon/helium boundary in a number of our post-AGB models. The production of fluorine, neon and phosphorus in the AGB intershell produces n overabundance at the surface of the merged stars, but generally not in sufficient quantity. However, the evidence for an AGB origin for these elements points to progenitor stars with initial masses in the range 1.9 - 3 solar masses. There is not yet sufficient information to discriminate the origin (fossil or prompt) of all the abundance anomalies observed in EHe and RCB stars. Further work is required on argon and s-process elements in the AGB intershell, and on the predicted yields of all elements from a hot merger. "
"In this paper we give the boundary string field theory description of brane-antibrane systems. From the world-sheet action of brane-antibrane systems we obtain the tachyon potential and discuss the tachyon condensation exactly. We also find the world-volume action including the gauge fields. Moreover we determine RR-couplings exactly for non-BPS branes and brane-antibranes. These couplings are written by superconnections and correspond to K^1(M) and K^0(M) for the non-BPS branes and brane-antibranes, respectively. We also show that Myers terms appear if we include the transverse scalars in the boundary sigma model action. "
"We propose a natural strategy to deal with compatible and incompatible binary questions, and with their time evolution. The strategy is based on the simplest, non-commutative, Hilbert space $\mathcal{H}=\mathbb{C}^2$, and on the (commuting or not) operators on it. As in ordinary Quantum Mechanics, the dynamics is driven by a suitable operator, the Hamiltonian of the system. We discuss a rather general situation, and analyse the resulting dynamics if the Hamiltonian is a simple Hermitian matrix. "
"This paper studies the problem of serving multiple live video streams to several different clients from a single access point over unreliable wireless links, which is expected to be major a consumer of future wireless capacity. This problem involves two characteristics. On the streaming side, different video streams may generate variable-bit-rate traffic with different traffic patterns. On the network side, the wireless transmissions are unreliable, and the link qualities differ from client to client. In order to alleviate the above stochastic aspects of both video streams and link unreliability, each client typically buffers incoming packets before playing the video. The quality of the video playback subscribed to by each flow depends, among other factors, on both the delay of packets as well as their throughput. In this paper we characterize precisely the capacity of the wireless video server in terms of what combination of joint per-packet-delays and throughputs can be supported for the set of flows, as a function of the buffering delay introduced at the server. We also address how to schedule packets at the access point to satisfy the joint per-packet-delay-throughput performance measure. We test the designed policy on the traces of three movies. From our tests, it appears to outperform other policies by a large margin. "
We obtain accurate eigenvalues for two recently derived SUSY partner Hamiltonians. We improve the Rayleigh-Ritz variational method proposed by the authors and show how to apply the Riccati-Pad\'{e} method to those particular partner potentials.
"We discuss the mean values of multiplicative functions over function fields. In particular, we adapt the authors' new proof of Halasz's theorem on mean values to this simpler setting. Several of the technical difficulties that arise over the integers disappear in the function field setting, which helps bring out more clearly the main ideas of the proofs over number fields. We also obtain Lipschitz estimates showing the slow variation of mean values of multiplicative functions over function fields, which display some features that are not present in the integer situation. "
"The reliability of quiet Sun magnetic field diagnostics based on the \ion{Fe}{1} lines at 6302 \AA has been questioned by recent work. We present here the results of a thorough study of high-resolution multi-line observations taken with the new spectro-polarimeter SPINOR, comprising the 5250 and 6302 \AA spectral domains. The observations were analyzed using several inversion algorithms, including Milne-Eddington, LTE with 1 and 2 components, and MISMA codes. We find that the line-ratio technique applied to the 5250 \AA lines is not sufficiently reliable to provide a direct magnetic diagnostic in the presence of thermal fluctuations and variable line broadening. In general, one needs to resort to inversion algorithms, ideally with realistic magneto-hydrodynamical constrains. When this is done, the 5250 \AA lines do not seem to provide any significant advantage over those at 6302 \AA . In fact, our results point towards a better performance with the latter (in the presence of turbulent line broadening). In any case, for very weak flux concentrations, neither spectral region alone provides sufficient constraints to fully disentangle the intrinsic field strengths. Instead, we advocate for a combined analysis of both spectral ranges, which yields a better determination of the quiet Sun magnetic properties. Finally, we propose the use of two other \ion{Fe}{1} lines (at 4122 and 9000 \AA) with identical line opacities that seem to work much better than the others. "
"As the technology of gravitational-wave and neutrino detectors becomes increasingly mature, a multi-messenger era of astronomy is ushered in. Advanced gravitational wave detectors are close to making a ground-breaking discovery of gravitational wave bursts (GWBs) associated with mergers of double neutron stars (NS-NS). It is essential to study the possible electromagnetic (EM) and neutrino emission counterparts of these GWBs. Recent observations and numerical simulations suggest that at least a fraction of NS-NS mergers may leave behind a massive millisecond magnetar as the merger product. Here we show that protons accelerated in the forward shock powered by a magnetar wind pushing the ejecta launched during the merger process would interact with photons generated in the dissipating magnetar wind and emit high energy neutrinos and photons. We estimate the typical energy and fluence of the neutrinos from such a scenario. We find that $\sim$PeV neutrinos could be emitted from the shock front as long as the ejecta could be accelerated to a relativistic speed. The diffuse neutrino flux from these events, even under the most optimistic scenarios, is too low to account for the two events announced by the IceCube Collaboration, but it is only slightly lower than the diffuse flux of GRBs, making it an important candidate for the diffuse background of $\sim$PeV neutrinos. The neutron-pion decay of these events make them a moderate contributor to the sub-TeV gamma-ray diffuse background. "
"Rashba spin splitting in two-dimensional (2D) semiconductor systems is generally calculated in a ${\bf k} \cdot {\bf p}$ Luttinger-Kohn approach where the spin splitting due to asymmetry emerges naturally from the bulk band structure. In recent years, several new classes of 2D systems have been discovered where electronic correlations are believed to have an important role. In these correlated systems, the effects of asymmetry leading to Rashba splitting have typically been treated phenomenologically. We compare these two approaches for the case of 2D electron systems in SrTiO$_3$-based heterostructures, and find that the two models produce fundamentally different behavior in regions of the Brillouin zone that are particularly relevant for magnetotransport. Our results demonstrate the importance of identifying the correct approach in the quantitative interpretation of experimental data, and are likely to be relevant to a range of 2D systems in correlated materials. "
"We demonstrate an in-situ technique to tune the emission energy of semiconductor quantum dots. The technique is based on laser-induced atomic intermixing applied to nanowire quantum dots grown using a site-selective process that allows for the deterministic tuning of individual emitters. A tuning range of up to 15 meV is obtained with a precision limited by the laser exposure time. A distinct saturation of the energy shift is observed, which suggests an intermixing mechanism relying on grown-in defects that are subsequently removed from the semiconductor material during annealing. The ability to tune different emitters into resonance with each other will be required for fabricating remote quantum dot-based sources of indistinguishable photons for secure quantum networks. "
"We show that for the thermal spectrum of Hawking radiation black hole's information loss paradox may still be present, even if including the entanglement information stored in the entangled Minkowski vacuum. And to avoid this inconsistency, the spectrum of Hawking radiation must be nonthermal. After reconsidering the derivation of Hawking effect, we find that the thermal spectrum is actually resulted from the geometric optics approximation in deriving the Bogolubov coefficients. When treated a little more accurately, we obtain some nonthermal spectrum for the Hawing radiation, which reduces to the thermal one in the geometric optics approximation. "
"The interpretation of count data originating from the current generation of DNA sequencing platforms requires special attention. In particular, the per-sample library sizes often vary by orders of magnitude from the same sequencing run, and the counts are overdispersed relative to a simple Poisson model These challenges can be addressed using an appropriate mixture model that simultaneously accounts for library size differences and biological variability. This approach is already well-characterized and implemented for RNA-Seq data in R packages such as edgeR and DESeq. We use statistical theory, extensive simulations, and empirical data to show that variance stabilizing normalization using a mixture model like the negative binomial is appropriate for microbiome count data. In simulations detecting differential abundance, normalization procedures based on a Gamma-Poisson mixture model provided systematic improvement in performance over crude proportions or rarefied counts -- both of which led to a high rate of false positives. In simulations evaluating clustering accuracy, we found that the rarefying procedure discarded samples that were nevertheless accurately clustered by alternative methods, and that the choice of minimum library size threshold was critical in some settings, but with an optimum that is unknown in practice. Techniques that use variance stabilizing transformations by modeling microbiome count data with a mixture distribution, such as those implemented in edgeR and DESeq, substantially improved upon techniques that attempt to normalize by rarefying or crude proportions. Based on these results and well-established statistical theory, we advocate that investigators avoid rarefying altogether. We have provided microbiome-specific extensions to these tools in the R package, phyloseq. "
"Ion fractional charge states, measured in situ in the heliosphere, depend on the properties of the plasma in the inner corona. As the ions travel outward in the solar wind and the electron density drops, the charge states remain essentially unaltered or ""frozen in"". Thus they can provide a powerful constraint on heating models of the corona and acceleration of the solar wind. We have implemented non-equilibrium ionization calculations into a 1D wave-turbulence-driven (WTD) hydrodynamic solar wind model and compared modeled charge states with the Ulysses 1994-5 in situ measurements. We have found that modeled charge state ratios of $C^{6+}/C^{5+}$ and $O^{7+}/O^{6+}$, among others, were too low compared with Ulysses measurements. However, a heuristic reduction of the plasma flow speed has been able to bring the modeled results in line with observations, though other ideas have been proposed to address this discrepancy. We discuss implications of our results and the prospect of including ion charge state calculations into our 3D MHD model of the inner heliosphere. "
"We study sequential coding of Markov sources under an error propagation constraint. An encoder sequentially compresses a sequence of vector-sources that are spatially i.i.d. but temporally correlated according to a first-order Markov process. The channel erases up to B packets in a single burst, but reveals all other packets to the destination. The destination is required to reproduce all the source-vectors instantaneously and in a lossless manner, except those sequences that occur in an error propagation window of length B + W following the start of the erasure burst. We define the rate-recovery function R(B, W) - the minimum achievable compression rate per source sample in this framework - and develop upper and lower bounds on this function. Our upper bound is obtained using a random binning technique, whereas our lower bound is obtained by drawing connections to multi-terminal source coding. Our upper and lower bounds coincide, yielding R(B, W), in some special cases. More generally, both the upper and lower bounds equal the rate for predictive coding plus a term that decreases as 1/(W+1), thus establishing a scaling behaviour of the rate-recovery function. For a special class of semi-deterministic Markov sources we propose a new optimal coding scheme: prospicient coding. An extension of this coding technique to Gaussian sources is also developed. For the class of symmetric Markov sources and memoryless encoders, we establish the optimality of random binning. When the destination is required to reproduce each source sequence with a fixed delay and when W = 0 we also establish the optimality of binning. "
The problem of determining the mathematical model of the dynamics of multi-dimensional control systems in the presence of noise under the condition that the correlation functions cannot be found. Known statistical dynamics of linear systems is a more effective alternative. Background information is presented in the form of individual implementations nonergodic stochastic processes. Such a realization is deterministic functions. We introduce the concept of systems of sets of signals for the components on the semiring. For the system of sets of linearly dependent and linearly independent of the measured signals of a certain frequency properties. Frequency method is designed to deal with the noise on the set of deterministic functions. Example is the determination of the dynamic characteristics of the aircraft in accordance with the data obtained in one automatic landing.
"We establish several properties of the integrated density of states for random quantum graphs: Under appropriate ergodicity and amenability assumptions, the integrated density of states can be defined using an exhaustion procedure by compact subgraphs. A trace per unit volume formula holds, similarly as in the Euclidean case. Our setting includes periodic graphs. For a model where the edge length are random and vary independently in a smooth way we prove a Wegner estimate and related regularity results for the integrated density of states. These results are illustrated for an example based on the Kagome lattice. In the periodic case we characterise all compactly supported eigenfunctions and calculate the position and size of discontinuities of the integrated density of states. "
"In health research, machine learning (ML) is often hailed as the new frontier of data analytics which, combined with big data, will purportedly revolutionise delivery of healthcare and ultimately lead to more informed public health policy and clinical decision-making. However, much of the promise of ML is predicated on prediction, which is fundamentally distinct from causal inference. Nevertheless, these two concepts are often conflated in practice. We briefly consider the sources of this conflation, and the implications it has for modelling practices and subsequent interpretation, in the context of generalised linear models (GLMs). We then go on to consider the implications for ML methods (which are typically applied to prediction tasks), and offer lessons for researchers seeking to use ML for both prediction and causal inference. Our primary aim is to highlight the key differences between models for prediction and causal inference in order to encourage the critical and transparent application of ML to problems in health research. "
"In the subgraph-freeness problem, we are given a constant-size graph $H$, and wish to determine whether the network contains $H$ as a subgraph or not. The \emph{property-testing} relaxation of the problem only requires us to distinguish graphs that are $H$-free from graphs that are $\epsilon$-far from $H$-free, meaning an $\epsilon$-fraction of their edges must be removed to obtain an $H$-free graph. Recently, Censor-Hillel et. al. and Fraigniaud et al. showed that in the property-testing regime it is possible to test $H$-freeness for any graph $H$ of size 4 in constant time, $O(1/\epsilon^2)$ rounds, regardless of the network size. However, Fraigniaud et. al. also showed that their techniques for graphs $H$ of size 4 cannot test $5$-cycle-freeness in constant time. In this paper we revisit the subgraph-freeness problem and show that $5$-cycle-freeness, and indeed $H$-freeness for many other graphs $H$ comprising more than 4 vertices, can be tested in constant time. We show that $C_k$-freeness can be tested in $O(1/\epsilon)$ rounds for any cycle $C_k$, improving on the running time of $O(1/\epsilon^2)$ of the previous algorithms for triangle-freeness and $C_4$-freeness. In the special case of triangles, we show that triangle-freeness can be solved in $O(1)$ rounds independently of $\epsilon$, when $\epsilon$ is not too small with respect to the number of nodes and edges. We also show that $T$-freeness for any constant-size tree $T$ can be tested in $O(1)$ rounds, even without the property-testing relaxation. Building on these results, we define a general class of graphs for which we can test subgraph-freeness in $O(1/\epsilon)$ rounds. This class includes all graphs over 5 vertices except the 5-clique, $K_5$. For cliques $K_s$ over $s \geq 3$ nodes, we show that $K_s$-freeness can be tested in $O(m^{1/2-1/(s-2)}/\epsilon^{1/2+1/(s-2)})$ rounds, where $m$ is the number of edges. "
"We show that four-dimensional N=2 ungauged Einstein-Maxwell supergravity can be embedded on the Randall-Sundrum 3-brane, as a consistent Kaluza-Klein reduction of five-dimensional N=4 gauged supergravity. In particular, this allows us to describe four-dimensional Reissner-Nordstrom black holes within the Randall-Sundrum scenario. Using earlier results on the embedding of five-dimensional N=4 gauged supergravity in ten dimensions, we can then describe the four-dimensional Einstein-Maxwell supergravity on the 3-brane, and its solutions, from a type IIB viewpoint. We also show that the minimal ungauged supergravities in D=5 and D=6 can be consistently embedded in the half-maximally supersymmetric gauged supergravities in D=6 and D=7 respectively. These allow us to construct solutions including BPS black holes and strings living in ""Randall-Sundrum 4-branes,"" and BPS self-dual strings living in ""Randall-Sundrum 5-branes."" We can also lift the embeddings to ten-dimensional massive type IIA and D=11 supergravity respectively. In particular, we obtain a solution describing the self-dual string living in the world-volume of an M5-brane, which can be viewed as an open membrane ending on the M5-brane. "
"We present an extensive synthetic observational analysis of numerically- simulated radio galaxies designed to explore the effectiveness of conventional observational analyses at recovering physical source properties. These are the first numerical simulations with sufficient physical detail to allow such a study. The present paper focuses on extraction of magnetic field properties from nonthermal intensity information. Synchrotron and inverse-Compton intensities provided meaningful information about distributions and strengths of magnetic fields, although considerable care was called for. Correlations between radio and X-ray surface brightness correctly revealed useful dynamical relationships between particles and fields. Magnetic field strength estimates derived from the ratio of X-ray to radio intensity were mostly within about a factor of two of the RMS field strength along a given line of sight. When emissions along a given line of sight were dominated by regions close to the minimum energy/equipartition condition, the field strengths derived from the standard power-law-spectrum minimum energy calculation were also reasonably close to actual field strengths, except when spectral aging was evident. Otherwise, biases in the minimum- energy magnetic field estimation mirrored actual differences from equipartition. The ratio of the inverse-Compton magnetic field to the minimum-energy magnetic field provided a rough measure of the actual total energy in particles and fields in most instances, within an order of magnitude. This may provide a practical limit to the accuracy with which one may be able to establish the internal energy density or pressure of optically thin synchrotron sources. "
"We consider a queueing network in which there are constraints on which queues may be served simultaneously; such networks may be used to model input-queued switches and wireless networks. The scheduling policy for such a network specifies which queues to serve at any point in time. We consider a family of scheduling policies, related to the maximum-weight policy of Tassiulas and Ephremides [IEEE Trans. Automat. Control 37 (1992) 1936--1948], for single-hop and multihop networks. We specify a fluid model and show that fluid-scaled performance processes can be approximated by fluid model solutions. We study the behavior of fluid model solutions under critical load, and characterize invariant states as those states which solve a certain network-wide optimization problem. We use fluid model results to prove multiplicative state space collapse. A notable feature of our results is that they do not assume complete resource pooling. "
"We demonstrate high count rate single photon detection at telecom wavelengths using a thermoelectrically-cooled semiconductor diode. Our device consists of a single InGaAs avalanche photodiode driven by a 2 GHz gating frequency signal and coupled to a tuneable self-differencing circuit for enhanced detection sensitivity. We find the count rate is linear with the photon flux in the single photon detection regime over approximately four orders of magnitude, and saturates at 1 gigacount/s at high photon fluxes. This result highlights promising potential for APDs in high bit rate quantum information applications. "
"We study a quantum dot coupled to two edge states of a quantum spin Hall insulator through electron tunnelings in the presence of a Rashba spin-orbital interaction induced by an external electric field. We show that if the electron interactions on the edge states are repulsive, there are two possible phases, depending on the Luttinger liquid parameter $K$. For $1/2<K<1$, the low-temperature physics is controlled by a previously identified two-channel Kondo fixed point. For the edge states with even stronger repulsive interactions, i.e. $1/4<K<1/2$, the system reaches another phase at low temperatures, described by a new two-channel Kondo fixed point. This phase is separated from the original one by a continuous phase transition upon varying the value of $K$ through the external electric field. The corresponding critical point is described by a free Dirac fermion backscattered by a local potential. We investigate the low-temperature properties associated with this new fixed point and also discuss the scaling behaviors of the system at the critical point. "
"A non conservative Abelian sandpile model with BTW toppling rule introduced in [Tsuchiya and Katori, Phys. Rev. E {\bf 61}, 1183 (2000)] is studied. Using a scaling analysis of the different energy scales involved in the model and numerical simulations it is shown that this model belong to a universality class different from that of previous models considered in the literature. "
"We present an interacting system of equations with sixteen supersymmetries and an $SO(2)\times SO(6)$ R-symmetry where the fields depend on two space and one null dimensions that is derived from a representation of the six-dimensional (2,0) superalgebra. The system can be viewed as two M5-branes compactified on $S^1_-\times {\mathbb T}^2$ or equivalently as M2-branes on ${\mathbb R}_+\times {\mathbb R}^2$, where $\pm$ refer to null directions. We show that for a particular choice of fields the dynamics can be reduced to motion on the moduli space of solutions to the Hitchin system. We argue that this provides a description of intersecting null M2-branes and is also related by U-duality to a DLCQ description of four-dimensional maximally supersymmetric Yang-Mills. "
"We report new results from CARMA observations of both continuum and HCO+(1-0) emission at 3.4 mm from W3-SE, a molecular core of intermediate mass, together with the continuum observations at 1.1 and 0.85/0.45 mm with the SMA and JCMT. A continuum emission core elongated from SE to NW (~10""), has been observed at the and further resolved into a double source with the SMA at 1.1 mm, with a separation of ~4"". Together with the measurements from the Spitzer and MSX at mid-IR, we determined the SED of W3-SE and fit it with a thermal dust emission model, suggesting the presence of two dust components with different temperatures. The emission at mm/submm wavelengths is dominated by a major cold (~41 K) with a mass of ~65 Msun. In addition, there is a weaker hot component (~400 K) which accounts for emission in the mid-IR, suggesting that a small fraction of dust has been heated by newly formed stars. We also imaged the molecular core in the HCO+(1-0) line using CARMA at an angular resolution ~6"". With the CARMA observations, we have verified the presence of a blue-dominated double peak profile toward this core. The line profile cannot be explained by infall alone. The broad velocity wings of the line profile suggest that other kinematics such as outflows within the central 6"" of the core likely dominate the resulting spectrum. The kinematics of the sub-structures of this core suggest that the molecular gas outside the main component appears to be dominated by the bipolar outflow originated from the dust core with a dynamical age of >30000 yr. Our analysis, based on the observations at wavelengths from mm/submm to mid-IR suggests that the molecular core W3-SE hosts a group of newly formed young stars and protostars. "
"Let $K$ be an imaginary quadratic field different from $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-1})$ and $\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-3})$. For a positive integer $N$, let $K_\mathfrak{n}$ be the ray class field of $K$ modulo $\mathfrak{n}=N\mathcal{O}_K$. By using the congruence subgroup $\pm\Gamma_1(N)$, we construct an extended form class group whose operation is basically the Dirichlet composition, and explicitly show that this group is isomorphic to the Galois group $\mathrm{Gal}(K_\mathfrak{n}/K)$. We also present algorithms to find all form classes and show how to multiply two form classes. As an application, we describe $\mathrm{Gal}(K_\mathfrak{n}^\mathrm{ab}/K)$ in terms of these extended form class groups for which $K_\mathfrak{n}^\mathrm{ab}$ is the maximal abelian extension of $K$ unramified outside prime ideals dividing $\mathfrak{n}$. "
"We develop a nonlinear force-free field (NLFFF) extrapolation code based on the magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) relaxation method. We extend the classical MHD relaxation method in two important ways. First, we introduce an algorithm initially proposed by cite{2002JCoPh.175..645D} to effectively clean the numerical errors associated with $nabla cdot vec{B}$. Second, the multi-grid type method is implemented in our NLFFF to perform direct analysis of the high-resolution magnetogram data. As a result of these two implementations, we successfully extrapolated the high resolution force-free field introduced by cite{1990ApJ...352..343L} with better accuracy in a drastically shorter time. We also applied our extrapolation method to the MHD solution obtained from the flux-emergence simulation by cite{2012ApJ...748...53M}. We found that NLFFF extrapolation may be less effective for reproducing areas higher than a half-domain, where some magnetic loops are found in a state of continuous upward expansion. However, an inverse S shaped structure consisting of the sheared and twisted loops formed in the lower region can be captured well through our NLFFF extrapolation method. We further discuss how well these sheared and twisted fields are reconstructed by estimating the magnetic topology and twist quantitatively. "
"Covariant scalar fields exhibit divergences when quantized in two or more spacetime dimensions: n \geg 2. Does perturbation theory, effective theories, the renormalization group, etc., tell us all there is to know about these problems? An alternative approach identifies the cause of divergences as due to the effort to multiplicatively relate two measures that are mutually singular, while the cure for those divergences is to introduce an O(\hbar) counterterm that converts mutually singular measures into equivalent measures. This procedure leads to a nontrivial, divergence-free formulation for all n \geq 2. Finally, a critical comparison of the new methods with traditional procedures is given. "
"This paper is crucial part of an experiment aimed to investigate whether Social Networks can be of help for Astrophysics. In the present case, in helping to eliminate the deep-routed wrong misconception of Flat Rotation Curves of Spiral Galaxies, more rapidly and efficiently than the traditional method of publishing peer-reviewed papers and organizing a number of international conferences. To reach this goal we created the Facebook Group ""Rotation Curve are not Flat"" that we filled with all the evidence necessary for an immediate and definite confrontation with the above fallacious legendary belief. In this paper, we solicit the interested Astrophysicist/Cosmologist FB users to join this group. Finally, the paper informs the Astrophysical Community that a widespread belief is instead an hoax, whose consideration may slow down the progress of science and that must be taken care by innovative means of communicating scientific advances. This test case may anticipate the future in which Web n.0 will become an effective scientific tool for Astrophysics. "
"We show in this paper that there exists no $H$-fractional Brownian field indexed by the cylinder $\mathbb{S}^1 \times ]0,\varepsilon[$ endowed with its product distance $d$ for any $\varepsilon>0$ and $H>0$. This is equivalent to say that $d^{2H}$ is not a negative definite kernel, which also leaves us without a proof that many classical stationary kernels, such that the Gaussian and exponential kernels, are positive definite kernels -- or covariances -- on the cylinder. We generalise this result from the cylinder to any Riemannian Cartesian product with a minimal closed geodesic. We also investigate the case of the cylinder endowed with a distance asymptotically close to the product distance in the neighbourhood of a circle. Another consequence is the discontinuity of the set of $H$ such that $d^{2H}$ is negative definite with respect to the Gromov-Hausdorff convergence on compact metric spaces. These results extend our comprehension of kernel construction on metric spaces, and in particular call for alternatives to classical kernels to allow for Gaussian modelling and kernel method learning on cylinders. "
"We show that plasmons in two-dimensional graphene can have net gain at terahertz frequencies. The coupling of the plasmons to interband electron-hole transitions in population inverted graphene layers can lead to plasmon amplification through the process of stimulated emission. We calculate plasmon gain for different electron-hole densities and temperatures and show that the gain values can exceed $10^{4}$ cm$^{-1}$ in the 1-10 terahertz frequency range, for electron-hole densities in the $10^{9}$-$10^{11}$ cm$^{-2}$ range, even when plasmon energy loss due to intraband scattering is considered. Plasmons are found to exhibit net gain for intraband scattering times shorter than 100 fs. Such high gain values could allow extremely compact terahertz amplifiers and oscillators that have dimensions in the 1-10 $\mu$m range. "
"We study the growth of the Betti sequence of the canonical module of a Cohen-Macaulay local ring. It is an open question whether this sequence grows exponentially whenever the ring is not Gorenstein. We answer the question of exponential growth affirmatively for a large class of rings, and prove that the growth is in general not extremal. As an application of growth, we give criteria for a Cohen-Macaulay ring possessing a canonical module to be Gorenstein. "
"A fluctuational electrodynamics-based formalism for calculating near-field radiative heat transfer between objects of arbitrary size and shape and an infinite surface is presented. The surface interactions are treated analytically via Sommerfeld's theory of electric dipole radiation above an infinite plane. The volume integral equation for the electric field is discretized using the thermal discrete dipole approximation (T-DDA). The framework is verified against exact results in the sphere-surface configuration, and is applied to analyze near-field radiative heat transfer between a complex-shaped probe and an infinite plane both made of silica. It is found that when the probe tip size is approximately equal to or smaller than the gap d separating the probe and the surface, coupled localized surface phonon (LSPh)-surface phonon-polariton (SPhP) mediated heat transfer occurs. In this regime, the net spectral heat rate exhibits four resonant modes due to LSPhs along the minor axis of the probe while the net total heat rate in the near field follows a d -0.3 power law. Conversely, when the probe tip size is much larger than the separation gap d, heat transfer is mediated by SPhPs resulting in two resonant modes in the net spectral heat rate corresponding to those of a single emitting silica surface while the net total heat rate approaches a d -2 power law. It is also demonstrated that a complex-shaped probe can be approximated by a prolate spheroidal electric dipole when the thermal wavelength is larger than the major axis of the spheroidal dipole and when the separation gap d is much larger than the radius of curvature of the dipole tip facing the surface. "
"Faceted interfaces are a key feature in self-resembling morphologies of many microstructures generated from solid state phase transformations. Interpretations, predictions and simulations of the faceted morphologies remain a challenge, especially for systems in which irrational orientation relationships (ORs) between two phases and irrational interface orientations (IOs) are preferred. In terms of structural singularities, this work suggests an integrated framework, which possibly encompasses all candidates of faceted interfaces. The structural singularities are identified in a matching pattern, a dislocation structure and/or a ledge structure. The resultant singular interfaces are discrete IOs, described with low index g's (rational orientations) and/or Delta-g's (either rational or irrational orientations). Elimination of defects exerts restrictions on the OR and the lattice parameters. Various models are grouped according to their determined results regarding the OR and IO, and the links between the models are clarified in the integrated framework. An irrational IO is usually due to elimination of dislocations in one direction, i.e., an O-line interface. Analytical methods using both 3D and 2D models for quantitative determinations of O-line interfaces are reviewed, and a detailed example showing the calculation for an irrational interface is given. The association between structural singularities and local energy minima is verified by atomistic calculations of interfacial energies in fcc/bcc alloys where it is found that the calculated equilibrium cross-sections are in a good agreement with observations from selected alloys. "
"This paper studies the evolution of self-appraisal and social power, for a group of individuals who discuss and form opinions. We consider a modification of the recently proposed DeGroot-Friedkin (DF) model, in which the opinion formation process takes place on the same timescale as the reflected appraisal process; we call this new model the single-timescale DF model. We provide a comprehensive analysis of the equilibria and convergence properties of the model for the settings of irreducible and reducible influence networks. For the setting of irreducible influence networks, the single-timescale DF model has the same behavior as the original DF model, that is, it predicts among other things that the social power ranking among individuals is asymptotically equal to their centrality ranking, that social power tends to accumulate at the top of the centrality ranking hierarchy, and that an autocratic (resp., democratic) power structure arises when the centrality scores are maximally nonuniform (resp., uniform). For the setting of reducible influence networks, the single-timescale DF model behaves differently from the original DF model in two ways. First, an individual, who corresponds to a reducible node in a reducible influence network, can keep all social power in the single-timescale DF model if the initial condition does so, whereas its social power asymptotically vanishes in the original DF model. Second, when the associated network has multiple sinks, the two models behave very differently: the original DF model has a single globally-attractive equilibrium, whereas any partition of social power among the sinks is allowable at equilibrium in the single-timescale DF model.

In this paper we provide exact expressions for propagators of noncommutative Bosonic or Fermionic field theories after adding terms of the Grosse-Wulkenhaar type in order to ensure Langmann-Szabo covariance. We emphasize the new Fermionic case and we give in particular all necessary bounds for the multiscale analysis and renormalization of the noncommutative Gross-Neveu model.
"This article is a sort of sequel of the earlier extensive review by Saha (1999a) where emphasis was laid down on the ground based single aperture, as well as on the working long baseline optical interferometers (LBI) situated at the various observatories across the globe that are producing a large amount of astronomical results. Since the future of high resolution astronomy lies with the new generation of arrays, the numerous technical challenges of developing such systems are addressed indicating the current trends and the path to future progress in interferometry. The new generation interferometers such as Palomar testbed interferometer (PTI), Navy prototype optical interferometer (NPOI), Keck interferometer, Very large telescope interferometer (VLTI), Center for high angular resolution astronomy (CHARA) array, Optical very large array (OVLA), Mitaka optical infrared arrays (MIRA), etc., are being developed. A few of them, viz., PTI, NPOI, IOTA are producing results. Among the working interferometers that have been described earlier by Saha (1999a), the expansion of the Grand interf\'erom\`etre \`a deux (two) t\'elescopes (GI2T), Infrared and optical telescope array (IOTA) are in progress. The current status of all these interferometers stated above are enumerated. The data analysis being carried out using the working interferometers are also described. The space interferometry programmes are advancing very fast. Among the notable ones are the Space technology 3 (ST3), Space interferometry mission (SIM), and Darwin; they have already received funds. The technical details of these interferometers and their objectives are highlighted. "
"The paper studies the time-homogeneous two-state Markov chains; the states are assumed to be binary symbols 0 and 1. The higher-order absolute differences taken from progressive states of a given chain are considered. A discrete capacity of subsets of natural series is defined and a limiting theorem for these differences, formulated in terms of Wiener criterion type relation, is presented. "
"13 Subcortical band heterotopia (SBH), also known as doublecortex syndrome, is a 14 malformation of cortical development resulting from mutations in the doublecortin gene 15 (DCX). It is characterized by a lack of migration of cortical neurons that accumulate in the 16 white matter forming a heterotopic band. Patients with SBH may present mild to moderate 17 intellectual disability as well as epilepsy. The SBH condition can be modeled in rats by in 18 utero knockdown (KD) of Dcx. The affected cells form an SBH reminiscent of that observed in 19 human patients and the animals develop a chronic epileptic condition in adulthood. Here, 20 we investigated if the presence of an SBH is sufficient to induce cognitive impairment in 21 "
"In this paper we consider a sequential ""meson emission"" mechanism for charmonium decays of the type Psi -> N Nbar m, where Psi is a generic charmonium state, N is a nucleon and m is a light meson. This decay mechanism, which may not be dominant in general, assumes that an NNbar pair is created during charmonium annihilation, and the light meson m is emitted from the outgoing nucleon or antinucleon line. A straightforward generalization of this model can incorporate intermediate N* resonances. We derive Dalitz plot event densities for the cases Psi = eta_c, J/psi, chi_c0, chi_c1} and psi' and m = pi0, f0 and omega (and implicitly, any 0^{-+}, 0^{++} or 1^{--} final light meson). It may be possible to separate the contribution of this decay mechanism to the full decay amplitude through characteristic event densities. For the decay subset Psi -> p pbar pi0 the two model parameters are known, so we are able to predict absolute numerical partial widths for Gamma(Psi -> p pbar pi0). In the specific case J/psi -> p pbar pi0 the predicted partial width and M_{p pi0} event distribution are intriguingly close to experiment. We also consider the possibility of scalar meson and glueball searches in Psi -> p pbar f0. If the meson emission contributions to Psi -> N Nbar m decays can be isolated and quantified, they can be used to estimate meson-nucleon strong couplings {g_NNm}, which are typically poorly known, and are a crucial input in meson exchange models of the NN interaction. The determination of g_NNpi from J\psi -> p pbar pi0 and the (poorly known) g_NNomega and the anomalous ""strong magnetic"" coupling kappa_{NNomega} from J/psi -> p pbar omega are considered as examples.

"An example of a graph that admits balanced fractional revival between antipodes is presented. It is obtained by establishing the correspondence between the quantum walk on a hypercube where the opposite vertices across the diagonals of each face are connected and, the coherent transport of single excitations in the extension of the Krawtchouk spin chain with next-to-nearest neighbour interactions. "
"We establish sharp boundary regularity estimates in $C^1$ and $C^{1,\alpha}$ domains for nonlocal problems of the form $Lu=f$ in $\Omega$, $u=0$ in $\Omega^c$. Here, $L$ is a nonlocal elliptic operator of order $2s$, with $s\in(0,1)$. First, in $C^{1,\alpha}$ domains we show that all solutions $u$ are $C^s$ up to the boundary and that $u/d^s\in C^\alpha(\bar\Omega)$, where $d$ is the distance to $\partial\Omega$. In $C^1$ domains, solutions are in general not comparable to $d^s$, and we prove a boundary Harnack principle in such domains. Namely, we show that if $u_1$ and $u_2$ are positive solutions, then $u_1/u_2$ is bounded and H\""older continuous up to the boundary. Finally, we establish analogous results for nonlocal equations with bounded measurable coefficients in non-divergence form. All these regularity results will be essential tools in a forthcoming work on free boundary problems for nonlocal elliptic operators \cite{CRS-obstacle}. "
"In this paper, in view of $Z_p$-Tucker lemma, we introduce a lower bound for chromatic number of Kneser hypergraphs which improves Dol'nikov-K{\v{r}}{\'{\i}}{\v{z}} bound. Next, we introduce multiple Kneser hypergraphs and we specify the chromatic number of some multiple Kneser hypergraphs. For a vector of positive integers $\vec{s}=(s_1,s_2,\ldots,s_m)$ and a partition $\pi=(P_1,P_2,\ldots,P_m)$ of $\{1,2,\ldots,n\}$, the multiple Kneser hypergraph ${\rm KG}^r(\pi; \vec{s};k)$ is a hypergraph with the vertex set $$V=\left\{A:\ A\subseteq P_1\cup P_2\cup\cdots \cup P_m,\ |A|=k, \forall 1\leq i\leq m;\ |A\cap P_i|\leq s_i\right\}$$ whose edge set is consist of any $r$ pairwise disjoint vertices. We determine the chromatic number of multiple Kneser hypergraphs provided that $r=2$ or for any $1\leq i\leq m$, we have $|P_i|\leq 2s_i$. A subset $S \subseteq [n]$ is almost $s$-stable if for any two distinct elements $i,j\in S$, we have $|i-j|\geq s$. The almost $s$-stable Kneser hypergraph ${\rm KG}^r(n,k)_{s-stab}^{\sim}$ has all $s$-stable subsets of $[n]$ as the vertex set and every $r$-tuple of pairwise disjoint vertices forms an edge. Meunier [The chromatic number of almost stable Kneser hypergraphs. J. Combin. Theory Ser. A, 118(6):1820--1828, 2011] showed for any positive integer $r$, $\chi({\rm KG}^r(n,k)_{2-stab}^{\sim})=\left\lceil {n-r(k-1) \over r-1}\right\rceil$. We extend this result to a large family of Schrijver hypergraphs. Finally, we present a colorful-type result which confirms the existence of a completely multicolored complete bipartite graph in any coloring of a graph. "
"B. Wilking introduced the dual foliation associated to a metric foliation in a Riemannian manifold with nonnegative sectional curvature, and proved that when the curvature is strictly positive, the dual foliation contains a single leaf, so that any two points in the ambient space can be joined by a horizontal curve. We show that the same phenomenon often occurs for nonnegatively curved Riemannian submersions even without the strict positive curvature condition, and irrespective of the particular metric. "
"We present multi--frequency radio observational results of the quasar 3C~48. The observations were carried out with the Very Large Array (VLA) at five frequencies of 0.33, 1.5, 4.8, 8.4, and 22.5 GHz, and with the Multi--Element Radio Linked Interferometer Network (MERLIN) at the two frequencies of 1.6 and 5 GHz. The source shows a one--sided jet to the north within 1\arcsec, which then extends to the northeast and becomes diffuse. Two bright components (N2 and N3), containing most of the flux density are present in the northern jet. The spectral index of the two components is $\alpha_{N2}\sim-0.99\pm0.12$ and $\alpha_{N3}\sim-0.84\pm0.23$ ($S\propto\nu^{\alpha}$). Our images show the presence of an extended structure surrounding component N2, suggestive of strong interaction between the jet and the interstellar medium (ISM) of the host galaxy. A steep--spectrum component, labelled as S, located 0.25 ardsec southwest to the flat--spectrum component which could be the core of 3C 48, is detected at a significance of $>15\sigma$. Both the location and the steepness of the spectrum of component S suggest the presence of a counter--jet in 3C 48. "
"Lower-dimensional (hyper)surfaces that can carry gauge or gauge/gravitational anomalies occur in many areas of physics: one-plus-one-dimensional boundaries or two-dimensional defect surfaces in condensed matter systems, four-dimensional brane-worlds in higher-dimensional cosmologies or various branes and orbifold planes in string or M-theory. In all cases we may have (quantum) anomalies localized on these hypersurfaces that are only cancelled by ``anomaly inflow'' from certain topological interactions in the bulk. Proper cancellation between these anomaly contributions of different origin requires a careful treatment of factors and signs. We review in some detail how these contributions occur and discuss applications in condensed matter (Quantum Hall Effect) and M-theory (five-branes and orbifold planes) "
"Power series expansions naturally arise whenever solutions of ordinary differential equations are studied in the regime of perturbation theory. In the case of quasi-periodic solutions the issue of convergence of the series is plagued of the so-called small divisor problem. In this paper we review a method recently introduced to deal with such a problem, based on renormalisation group ideas and multiscale techniques. Applications to both quasi-integrable Hamiltonian systems (KAM theory) and non-Hamiltonian dissipative systems are discussed. The method is also suited to situations in which the perturbation series diverges and a resummation procedure can be envisaged, leading to a solution which is not analytic in the perturbation parameter: we consider explicitly examples of solutions which are only infinitely differentiable in the perturbation parameter, or even defined on a Cantor set. "
"We report the detection, with ${\it Chandra}$ and XMM-${\it Newton}$, of faint, soft X-ray emission from four symbiotics stars that were not known to be X-ray sources. These four object show a $\beta$-type X-ray spectrum, i.e. their spectra can be modeled with an absorbed optically thin thermal emission with temperatures of a few million degrees. Photometric series obtained with the Optical Monitor on board XMM-${\it Newton}$ from V2416 Sgr and NSV 25735 support the proposed scenario where the X-ray emission is produced in a shock-heated region inside the symbiotic nebulae.

"In this paper we discuss analogue computers based on quantum optical systems accelerating dynamic programming for some computational problems. These computers, at least in principle, can be realized by actually existing devices. We estimate an acceleration in resolving of some NP-hard problems that can be obtained in such a way versus deterministic computers "
"The d-dimensional Hamming torus is the graph whose vertices are all of the integer points inside an a_1 n X a_2 n X ... X a_d n box in R^d (for constants a_1, ..., a_d > 0), and whose edges connect all vertices within Hamming distance one. We study the size of the largest connected component of the subgraph generated by independently removing each vertex of the Hamming torus with probability 1-p. We show that if p=\lambda / n, then there exists \lambda_c > 0, which is the positive root of a degree d polynomial whose coefficients depend on a_1, ..., a_d, such that for \lambda < \lambda_c the largest component has O(log n) vertices (a.a.s. as n \to \infty), and for \lambda > \lambda_c the largest component has (1-q) \lambda (\prod_i a_i) n^{d-1} + o(n^{d-1}) vertices and the second largest component has O(log n) vertices (a.a.s.). An implicit formula for q < 1 is also given. Surprisingly, the value of \lambda_c that we find is distinct from the critical value for the emergence of a giant component in the random edge subgraph of the Hamming torus. Additionally, we show that if p = c log n / n, then when c < (d-1) / (\sum a_i) the site subgraph of the Hamming torus is not connected, and when c > (d-1) / (\sum a_i) the subgraph is connected (a.a.s.). We also show that the subgraph is connected precisely when it contains no isolated vertices. "
We propose a classical optical interferometry scheme that reproduces dispersion-insensitive Hong-Ou-Mandel interferograms. The interferometric scheme is derived from a systematic method based on the time-reversal symmetry of quantum mechanics. The scheme uses a time-reversed version of a Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometer with pairs of orthogonally polarized input laser pulses. We experimentally demonstrate automatic dispersion cancellation using the interferometry. The results show that the interferometer can obtain high-visibility interferograms with high signal conversion efficiency.
"Emoji is an essential component in dialogues which has been broadly utilized on almost all social platforms. It could express more delicate feelings beyond plain texts and thus smooth the communications between users, making dialogue systems more anthropomorphic and vivid. In this paper, we focus on automatically recommending appropriate emojis given the contextual information in multi-turn dialogue systems, where the challenges locate in understanding the whole conversations. More specifically, we propose the hierarchical long short-term memory model (H-LSTM) to construct dialogue representations, followed by a softmax classifier for emoji classification. We evaluate our models on the task of emoji classification in a real-world dataset, with some further explorations on parameter sensitivity and case study. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves the best performances on all evaluation metrics. It indicates that our method could well capture the contextual information and emotion flow in dialogues, which is significant for emoji recommendation. "
"In this paper we establish three basic equations for a general soliton structure on the Riemannian manifold $(M, <, >)$. We then draw some geometric conclusions with the aid of the maximum principle. "
"We have discussed the correspondence of the well-accepted $f(G)$ gravity theory with two dark energy models : $(m,n)$-type holographic dark energy [$(m,n)$-type HDE] and entropy-corrected $(m,n)$-type holographic dark energy. For this purpose, we have considered the power law form of the scale factor $a(t)=a_{0}t^{p}, p>1$. The reconstructed $f(G)$ in these models have been found and the models in both cases are found to be realistic. We have also discussed the classical stability issues in both models. The $(m,n)$-type HDE and its entropy-corrected versions are more stable than the ordinary HDE model. "
"Elfving's Theorem is a major result in the theory of optimal experimental design, which gives a geometrical characterization of $c-$optimality. In this paper, we extend this theorem to the case of multiresponse experiments, and we show that when the number of experiments is finite, $c-,A-,T-$ and $D-$optimal design of multiresponse experiments can be computed by Second-Order Cone Programming (SOCP). Moreover, our SOCP approach can deal with design problems in which the variable is subject to several linear constraints. We give two proofs of this generalization of Elfving's theorem. One is based on Lagrangian dualization techniques and relies on the fact that the semidefinite programming (SDP) formulation of the multiresponse $c-$optimal design always has a solution which is a matrix of rank $1$. Therefore, the complexity of this problem fades. We also investigate a \emph{model robust} generalization of $c-$optimality, for which an Elfving-type theorem was established by Dette (1993). We show with the same Lagrangian approach that these model robust designs can be computed efficiently by minimizing a geometric mean under some norm constraints. Moreover, we show that the optimality conditions of this geometric programming problem yield an extension of Dette's theorem to the case of multiresponse experiments. When the number of unknown parameters is small, or when the number of linear functions of the parameters to be estimated is small, we show by numerical examples that our approach can be between 10 and 1000 times faster than the classic, state-of-the-art algorithms. "
"We consider the unparticle action that is made gauge invariant by inclusion of an open Wilson line factor. In deriving vertexes from such an action it has been customary to use a form of differentiating the Wilson line originally proposed by Mandelstam. Using a simple example, we show that the Mandelstam derivative is mathematically inconsistent. We show that there are two ways to define differentiation of the Wilson line. The mathematically consistent method is to differentiate the explicit dependence of the line on the endpoint. The other method is a functional derivative and corresponds in a limiting case to the Mandelstam derivative. We also show that the only path that can be used in the Wilson line integral that leaves the unparticle action both Poincare and scale invariant is the straight line. "
"In spiral galaxies, we explain their non-Keplerian rotation curves (RCs) by means of a non-luminous component embedding their stellar-gaseous disks. Understanding the detailed properties of this component (labelled Dark Matter, DM) is one of the most pressing issues of Cosmology. We investigate the recent relationship (claimed by Walker et al. 2010, hereafter W+10) between $r$, the galaxy radial coordinate, and $V_h(r)$, the dark halo contribution to the circular velocity at $r$, {\it a}) in the framework of the Universal Rotation Curve (URC) paradigm and directly {\it b}) by means of the kinematics of a large sample of DM dominated spirals. We find a general agreement between the W+10 claim, the distribution of DM emerging from the URC and that inferred in the (low luminosity) objects of our sample. We show that such a phenomenology, linking the spiral's luminosity, radii and circular velocities, implies an evident inconsistency with (naive) predictions in the $\Lambda$ Cold Dark Matter ($\Lambda$CDM) scenario. "
"Ordinary differential equations (ODEs) are used to model dynamic systems appearing in engineering, physics, biomedical sciences and many other fields. These equations contain unknown parameters, say $\bm\theta$ of physical significance which have to be estimated from the noisy data. Often there is no closed form analytic solution of the equations and hence we cannot use the usual non-linear least squares technique to estimate the unknown parameters. There is a two-step approach to solve this problem, where the first step involves fitting the data nonparametrically. In the second step the parameter is estimated by minimizing the distance between the nonparametrically estimated derivative and the derivative suggested by the system of ODEs. The statistical aspects of this approach have been studied under the frequentist framework. We consider this two-step estimation under the Bayesian framework. The response variable is allowed to be multidimensional and the true mean function of it is not assumed to be in the model. We induce a prior on the regression function using a random series based on the B-spline basis functions. We establish the Bernstein-von Mises theorem for the posterior distribution of the parameter of interest. Interestingly, even though the posterior distribution of the regression function based on splines converges at a rate slower than $n^{-1/2}$, the parameter vector $\bm\theta$ is nevertheless estimated at $n^{-1/2}$ rate. "
"The characteristic of the solar acoustic spectrum is such that mode lifetimes get shorter and spatial leaks get closer in frequency as the degree of a mode increases for a given order. A direct consequence of this property is that individual p-modes are only resolved at low and intermediate degrees, and that at high degrees, individual modes blend into ridges. Once modes have blended into ridges, the power distribution of the ridge defines the ridge central frequency and it will mask the true underlying mode frequency. An accurate model of the amplitude of the peaks that contribute to the ridge power distribution is needed to recover the underlying mode frequency from fitting the ridge. We present the results of fitting high degree power ridges (up to l = 900) computed from several two to three-month-long time-series of full-disk observations taken with the Michelson Doppler Imager (MDI) on-board the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory between 1996 and 1999. We also present a detailed discussion of the modeling of the ridge power distribution, and the contribution of the various observational and instrumental effects on the spatial leakage, in the context of the MDI instrument. We have constructed a physically motivated model (rather than some ad hoc correction scheme) resulting in a methodology that can produce an unbiased determination of high-degree modes, once the instrumental characteristics are well understood. Finally, we present changes in high degree mode parameters with epoch and thus solar activity level and discuss their significance. "
"We consider interacting many particle systems with quenched disorder having strong Griffiths singularities, which are characterized by the dynamical exponent, z, such as random quantum systems and exclusion processes. In several d=1 and d=2 dimensional problems we have calculated the inverse time-scales, t^{-1}, in finite samples of linear size, L, either exactly or numerically. In all cases, having a discrete symmetry, the distribution function, P(t^{-1},L), is found to depend on the variable, u=t^{-1}L^{z/d}, and to be universal given by the limit distribution of extremes of independent and identically distributed random numbers. This finding is explained in the framework of a strong disorder renormalization group approach when, after fast degrees of freedom are decimated out the system is transformed into a set of non-interacting localized excitations. The Frechet distribution of P(t^{-1},L) is expected to hold for all random systems having a strong disorder fixed point, in which the Griffiths singularities are dominated by disorder fluctuations. "
"This paper examines the question of who technology users on the trail are, what their technological uses and needs are, and what conflicts exist between different trail users regarding technology use and experience, toward understanding how experiences of trail users contribute to designers. We argue that exploring these tensions provide opportunities for design that can be used to both mitigate conflicts and improve community on the trail. "
"We study the six-dimensional solvmanifolds that admit complex structures of splitting type classifying the underlying solvable Lie algebras. In particular, many complex structures of this type exist on the Nakamura manifold $X$, and they allow us to construct a countable family of compact complex non-$\partial\overline\partial$ manifolds $X_k$, $k\in\mathbb{Z}$, that admit a small holomorphic deformation $\{(X_{k})_{t}\}_{t\in\Delta_k}$ satisfying the $\partial\overline\partial$-Lemma for any $t\in\Delta_k$ except for the central fibre. Moreover, a study of the existence of special Hermitian metrics is also carried out on six-dimensional solvmanifolds with splitting-type complex structures. "
"We probe the dynamic strength of multiple biotin-streptavidin adhesion bonds under linear loading using the biomembrane force probe setup for dynamic force spectroscopy. Measured rupture force histograms are compared to results from a master equation model for the stochastic dynamics of bond rupture under load. This allows us to extract the distribution of the number of initially closed bonds. We also extract the molecular parameters of the adhesion bonds, in good agreement with earlier results from single bond experiments. Our analysis shows that the peaks in the measured histograms are not simple multiples of the single bond values, but follow from a superposition procedure which generates different peak positions. "
"We investigate the performance of a hybrid plasma solver on the test problem of an ion beam. The parallel solver is based on cell centered finite differences in space, and a predictor-corrector leapfrog scheme in time. The implementation is done in the FLASH software framework. It is shown that the solver conserves energy well over time, and that the parallelization is efficient (it exhibits weak scaling). "
"There is a natural analogue of weak Bruhat order on the involutions in any Coxeter group, which was first considered by Richardson and Springer in the context of symmetric varieties. The saturated chains in this order from the identity to a given involution are in bijection with the reduced words for a certain set of group elements which we call atoms. We study the combinatorics of atoms for involutions in the group of signed permutations. This builds on prior work concerning atoms for involutions in the symmetric group, which was motivated by connections to the geometry of certain spherical varieties. We prove that the set of atoms for any signed involution naturally has the structure of a graded poset whose maximal elements are counted by Catalan numbers. We also characterize the signed involutions with exactly one atom and prove some enumerative results about reduced words for signed permutations. "
"This paper addresses the problem of blind separation of convolutive mixtures of BPSK and circular linearly modulated signals with unknown (and possibly different) baud rates and carrier frequencies. In previous works, we established that the Constant Modulus Algorithm (CMA) is able to extract a source from a convolutive mixture of circular linearly modulated signals. We extend the analysis of the extraction capabilities of the CMA when the mixing also contains BPSK signals. We prove that if the various source signals do not share any non zero cyclic frequency nor any non conjugate cyclic frequencies, the local minima of the constant modulus cost function are separating filters. Unfortunately, the minimization of the Godard cost function generally fails when considering BPSK signals that have the same rates and the same carrier frequencies. This failure is due to the existence of non-separating local minima of the Godard cost function. In order to achieve the separation, we propose a simple modification of the Godard cost function which only requires knowledge of the BPSK sources frequency offsets at the receiver side. We provide various simulations of realistic digital communications scenarios that support our theoretical statements. "
"In this paper, we consider a series of events observed at spaced time intervals and present a method of representation of the series. To explain an idea, by dealing with a set of gene expression data, which could be obtained from developmental biology, the procedures are sketched with comments in some details. We mean representation by choosing a proper function, which fits well with observed data of a series, and turning its characteristics into numbers, which extract the intrinsic properties of fluctuating data. With help of a machine learning techniques, this method will give a classification of developmental biological data as well as any varying data during a certain period and the classification can be applied for diagnosis of a disease. "
"We have experimentally demonstrated polarizers and polarizing beam splitters based on microwave-scale two-dimensional photonic crystals. Using polarized microwaves within certain frequency bands, we have observed a squared-sinusoid (Malus) transmission law when using the photonic crystal as a polarizer. The photonic crystal also functions as a polarizing beamsplitter; in this configuration it can be engineered to split incident polarizations in either order, making it more versatile than conventional, Brewster-angle beamsplitters.

"We give a geometric interpretation of weighted homogeneous solutions to the associativity equation in terms of the web theory and construct a massive Frobenius 3-fold germ via a singular 3-web germ satisfying the following conditions: 1) the web germ admits at least one infinitesimal symmetry, 2) the Chern connection form is holomorphic, 3) the curvature form vanishes identically. "
"We explore the connection between the operator product expansion (OPE) in the boundary and worldsheet conformal field theories in the context of AdS$_{d+1}$/CFT$_d$ correspondence. Considering single trace scalar operators in the boundary theory and using the saddle point analysis of the worldsheet OPE [1], we derive an explicit relation between OPE coefficients in the boundary and worldsheet theories for the contribution of single trace spin $\ell$ operators to the OPE. We also consider external vector operators and obtain the relation between OPE coefficients for the exchange of single trace scalar operators in the OPE. We revisit the relationship between the bulk cubic couplings in the Supergravity approximation and the OPE coefficients in the dual boundary theory. Our results match with the known examples from the case of AdS$_3$/CFT$_2$. For the operators whose two and three point correlators enjoy a non renormalization theorem, this gives a set of three way relations between the bulk cubic couplings in supergravity and the OPE coefficients in the boundary and worldsheet theories. "
"This paper presents a study on the reduction of the sampling frequency of the current signals of an induction motor, the reductions are performed by means time-decimation technique for digital signal processing. We have used the Fast Fourier Transform to obtain the fault signal spectrum of broken bars. The results have shown how the decimation technique significantly reduces the number of operations and the time required to calculate the Fast Fourier Transform without loss of information. This approach provides a better performance of embedded systems for fault diagnosis based on characteristic of amplitude signal modulation. "
"We study the Euler equations with the so-called Ekman damping in the whole 2D space. The global well-posedness and dissipativity for the weak infinite energy solutions of this problem in the uniformly local spaces is verified based on the further development of the weighted energy theory for the Navier-Stokes and Euler type problems. In addition, the existence of weak locally compact global attractor is proved and some extra compactness of this attractor is obtained. "
"We present a current and charge conserving theory for the low frequency admittance of a quantum point contact. We derive expressions for the electrochemical capacitance and the displacement current. The latter is determined by the {\em emittance} which equals the capacitance only in the limit of vanishing transmission. With the opening of channels the capacitance and the emittance decrease in a step-like manner in synchronism with the conductance steps. For vanishing reflection, the capacitance vanishes and the emittance is negative. "
"We give results characterising ternary Kloosterman sums modulo 9 and 27. This leads to a complete characterisation of values that ternary Kloosterman sums assume modulo 18 and 54. The proofs uses Stickelberger's theorem, the Gross-Koblitz formula and Fourier analysis. "
"We deal with lattices that are generated by the Vandermonde matrices associated to the roots of Chebyshev-polynomials. If the dimension $d$ of the lattice is a power of two, i.e. $d=2^m, m \in \mathbb{N}$, the resulting lattice is an admissible lattice in the sense of Skriganov. Those are related to the Frolov cubature formulas, which recently drew attention due to their optimal convergence rates in a broad range of function spaces with mixed smoothness. We prove that the resulting lattices are orthogonal and possess a lattice representation matrix with entries not larger than $2$ (in modulus). This allows for an efficient enumeration of the Frolov cubature nodes in the $d$-cube $[-1/2,1/2]^d$ up to dimension $d=16$. "
"The requirement of high data-rate in the fifth generation wireless systems (5G) calls for the ultimate utilization of the wide bandwidth in the mmWave frequency band. Researchers seeking to compensate for mmWave's high path loss and to achieve both gain and directivity have proposed that mmWave multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems make use of beamforming systems. Hybrid beamforming in mmWave demonstrates promising performance in achieving high gain and directivity by using phase shifters at the analog processing block. What remains a problem, however, is the actual implementation of mmWave beamforming systems; to fabricate such a system is costly and complex. With the aim of reducing such cost and complexity, this article presents actual prototypes of the lens antenna as an effective device to be used in the future 5G mmWave hybrid beamforming systems. Using a lens as a passive phase shifter enables beamforming without the heavy network of active phase shifters, while gain and directivity are achieved by the energy-focusing property of the lens. Proposed in this article are two types of lens antennas, one for static and the other for mobile usage. Their performance is evaluated using measurements and simulation data along with link-level analysis via a software defined radio (SDR) platform. Results show the promising potential of the lens antenna for its high gain and directivity, and its improved beam-switching feasibility compared to when a lens is not used. System-level evaluations reveal the significant throughput enhancement in both real indoor and outdoor environments. Moreover, the lens antenna's design issues are also discussed by evaluating different lens sizes. "
"We consider different classes of scalar field models including quintessence, and tachyon scalar fields with a variety of generic potential belonging to thawing type. Assuming the scalar field is initially frozen at $w=-1$, we evolve the system until the present time. We focus on observational quantities like Hubble parameter, luminosity distance as well as quantities related to the Baryon Acoustic Oscillation measurement. Our study shows that with present state of observations, one can not distinguish amongst various models which in turn can not be distinguished from cosmological constant. This lead us to a conclusion that there is a thin chance to observe the dark energy metamorphosis in near future. "
"We present an analysis of the radio properties of large samples of Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs) at $z \sim 3$, 4, and 5 from the COSMOS field. The median stacking analysis yields a statistical detection of the $z \sim 3$ LBGs (U-band drop-outs), with a 1.4 GHz flux density of $0.90 \pm 0.21 \mu$Jy. The stacked emission is unresolved, with a size $< 1""$, or a physical size $< 8$kpc. The total star formation rate implied by this radio luminosity is $31\pm 7$ $M_\odot$ year$^{-1}$, based on the radio-FIR correlation in low redshift star forming galaxies. The star formation rate derived from a similar analysis of the UV luminosities is 17 $M_\odot$ year$^{-1}$, without any correction for UV dust attenuation. The simplest conclusion is that the dust attenuation factor is 1.8 at UV wavelengths. However, this factor is considerably smaller than the standard attenuation factor $\sim 5$, normally assumed for LBGs. We discuss potential reasons for this discrepancy, including the possibility that the dust attenuation factor at $z \ge 3$ is smaller than at lower redshifts. Conversely, the radio luminosity for a given star formation rate may be systematically lower at very high redshift. Two possible causes for a suppressed radio luminosity are: (i) increased inverse Compton cooling of the relativistic electron population due to scattering off the increasing CMB at high redshift, or (ii) cosmic ray diffusion from systematically smaller galaxies. The radio detections of individual sources are consistent with a radio-loud AGN fraction of 0.3%. One source is identified as a very dusty, extreme starburst galaxy (a 'submm galaxy'). "
"One of the factors that limits the scale, performance, and sophistication of distributed applications is the difficulty of concurrently executing them on multiple distributed computing resources. In part, this is due to a poor understanding of the general properties and performance of the coupling between applications and dynamic resources. This paper addresses this issue by integrating abstractions representing distributed applications, resources, and execution processes into a pilot-based middleware. The middleware provides a platform that can specify distributed applications, execute them on multiple resource and for different configurations, and is instrumented to support investigative analysis. We analyzed the execution of distributed applications using experiments that measure the benefits of using multiple resources, the late-binding of scheduling decisions, and the use of backfill scheduling. "
"We evaluate at one loop the self-energies in generic D dimensions for the W,Z mesons in the Electroweak model where the gauge group is nonlinearly realized. In this model the Higgs boson parameters are absent, while a second mass parameter appears together with a scale for the radiative corrections. We estimate these parameters in a simplified fit on leptons and gauge bosons data. We check physical unitarity and the absence of infrared divergences. Landau gauge is used. "
"We consider the $k$-Center problem and some generalizations. For $k$-Center a set of $k$ center vertices needs to be found in a graph $G$ with edge lengths, such that the distance from any vertex of $G$ to its nearest center is minimized. This problem naturally occurs in transportation networks, and therefore we model the inputs as graphs with bounded highway dimension, as proposed by Abraham et al. [SODA 2010]. We show both approximation and fixed-parameter hardness results, and how to overcome them using fixed-parameter approximations, where the two paradigms are combined. In particular, we prove that for any $\varepsilon>0$ computing a $(2-\varepsilon)$-approximation is W[2]-hard for parameter $k$ and NP-hard for graphs with highway dimension $O(\log^2 n)$. The latter does not rule out fixed-parameter $(2-\varepsilon)$-approximations for the highway dimension parameter $h$, but implies that such an algorithm must have at least doubly exponential running time in $h$ if it exists, unless the ETH fails. On the positive side, we show how to get below the approximation factor of $2$ by combining the parameters $k$ and $h$: we develop a fixed-parameter $3/2$-approximation with running time $2^{O(kh\log h)}\cdot n^{O(1)}$. Additionally we prove that, unless P=NP, our techniques cannot be used to compute fixed-parameter $(2-\varepsilon)$-approximations for only the parameter $h$. We also provide similar fixed-parameter approximations for the weighted $k$-Center and $(k,\mathcal{F})$-Partition problems, which generalize $k$-Center. "
"We consider a family of perturbative heterotic string backgrounds. These are complex threefolds X with c_1 = 0, each with a gauge field solving the Hermitian Yang-Mill's equations and compatible B and H fields that satisfy the anomaly cancellation conditions. Our perspective is to consider a geometry in which these backgrounds are fibred over a parameter space. If the manifold X has coordinates x, and parameters are denoted by y, then it is natural to consider coordinate transformations x \to \tilde{x}(x,y) and y \to \tilde{y}(y). Similarly, gauge transformations of the gauge field and B field also depend on both x and y. In the process of defining deformations of the background fields that are suitably covariant under these transformations, it turns out to be natural to extend the gauge field A to a gauge field \IA on the extended (x,y)-space. Similarly, the B, H, and other fields are also extended. The total space of the fibration of the heterotic structures is the Universal Geometry of the title. The extension of gauge fields has been studied in relation to Donaldson theory and monopole moduli spaces. String vacua furnish a richer application of these ideas. One advantage of this point of view is that previously disparate results are unified into a simple tensor formulation. In a previous paper, by three of the present authors, the metric on the moduli space of heterotic theories was derived, correct through order \alpha', and it was shown how this was related to a simple Kahler potential. With the present formalism, we are able to rederive the results of this previously long and involved calculation, in less than a page. "
"The spin dynamics of a harmonically trapped Bose-Einstein condensed binary mixture of sodium atoms is experimentally investigated at finite temperature. In the collisional regime the motion of the thermal component is shown to be damped because of spin drag, while the two condensates exhibit a counter flow oscillation without friction, thereby providing direct evidence for spin superfluidity. Results are also reported in the collisionless regime where the spin components of both the condensate and thermal part oscillate without damping, their relative motion being driven by a mean field effect. We also measure the static polarizability of the condensed and thermal parts and we find a large increase of the condensate polarizability with respect to the T=0 value, in agreement with the predictions of theory.

"The Belle II experiment at the SuperKEKB collider in Tsukuba, Japan, will start physics data taking in 2018. It is planned to accumulate an e+ e- collision data set of 50 /ab, about 50 times larger than that of the earlier Belle experiment. The software library for the new detector will use GEANT4 for Monte Carlo simulation and is an entirely new software and reconstruction system based on modern computing tools. Examples of physics simulation including beam background overlays will be described. "
"In this paper we deal with the following fractional Choquard equation \begin{equation*} \left\{ \begin{array}{ll} \varepsilon^{sp}(-\Delta)^{s}_{p} u + V(x)|u|^{p-2}u = \varepsilon^{\mu-N}\left(\frac{1}{|x|^{\mu}}*F(u)\right)f(u) \mbox{ in } \mathbb{R}^{N},\\ u\in W^{s,p}(\R^{N}), \quad u>0 \mbox{ in } \mathbb{R}^{N}, \end{array} \right. \end{equation*} where $\varepsilon>0$ is a small parameter, $s\in (0, 1)$, $p\in (1, \infty)$, $N>sp$, $(-\Delta)^{s}_{p}$ is the fractional $p$-Laplacian, $V$ is a positive continuous potential, $0<\mu<sp$, and $f$ is a continuous superlinear function with subcritical growth. Using minimax arguments and the Ljusternik-Schnirelmann category theory, we obtain the existence, multiplicity and concentration of positive solutions for $\varepsilon>0$ small enough. "
"The AGT conjecture identifying conformal blocks with the Nekrasov functions is investigated for the spherical conformal blocks with more than 4 external legs. The diagram technique which arises in conformal block calculation involves propagators and vertices. We evaluated vertices with two Virasoro algebra descendants and explicitly checked the AGT relation up to the third order of the expansion for the 5-point and 6-point conformal blocks on sphere confirming all the predictions of arXiv:0906.3219 relevant in this situation. We propose that U(1)-factor can be extracted from the matrix elements of the free field Vertex operators. We studied the n-point case, and found out that our results confirm the AGT conjecture up to the third order expansions. "
"We compare the distribution of stars of different spectral types, and hence mean age, within the central SMC and find that the asymmetric structures are almost exclusively composed of young main sequence stars. Because of the relative lack of older stars in these features, and the extremely regular distribution of red giant and clump stars in the SMC central body, we conclude that tides alone are not responsible for the irregular appearance of the central SMC. The dominant physical mechanism in determining the current-day appearance of the SMC must be star formation triggered by a hydrodynamic interaction between gaseous components. These results extend the results of population studies (cf. Gardiner and Hatzidimitriou) inward in radius and also confirm the suggestion of the spheroidal nature of the central SMC based on kinematic arguments (Dopita et al; Hardy, Suntzeff & Azzopardi). Finally, we find no evidence in the underlying older stellar population for a ``bar'' or ``outer arm'', again supporting our classification of the central SMC as a spheroidal body with highly irregular recent star formation. "
"The magnetic properties of iron pnictide superconductors with magnetic rare-earth ions under strong magnetic field are investigated based on the cluster self-consistent field method. Starting from an effective Heisenberg model, we present the evolution of magnetic structures on magnetic field in RFeAsO (R=Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Gd and Tb) and RFe2As2 (R=Eu) compounds. It is found that spin-flop transition occurs in both rare-earth and iron layers under magnetic field, in good agreement with the experimental results. The interplay between rare-earth and iron spins plays a key role in the magnetic-field-driven magnetic phase transition, which suggests that the rare-earth layers can modulate the magnetic behaviors of iron layers. In addition, the factors that affect the critical magnetic field for spin-flop transition are also discussed. "
"Quantum computers are hypothetical devices, based on quantum physics, that would enable us to perform certain computations hundreds of orders of magnitude faster than digital computers. This feature is coined as ""quantum supremacy"" and one aspect or another of such quantum computational supremacy might be brought about in experiments in the near future: by implementing quantum error-correction, systems of non-interacting bosons, exotic new phases of matter called anyons, quantum annealing, or in various other ways. A main concern regarding the feasibility of quantum computers is that quantum systems are inherently noisy: we cannot accurately control them, and we cannot accurately describe them. We will describe an optimistic hypothesis of quantum noise that would allow quantum computing and a pessimistic hypothesis that wouldn't. The quantum computer puzzle is deciding between these two hypotheses. Here is a brief summary of the author's pessimistic point of view as explained in the paper: understanding quantum computers in the presence of noise requires consideration of behavior at different scales. In the small scale, standard models of noise from the mid-90s are suitable, and quantum evolutions and states described by them manifest a very low-level computational power. This small-scale behavior has far-reaching consequences for the behavior of noisy quantum systems at larger scales. On the one hand, it does not allow reaching the starting points for quantum fault tolerance and quantum supremacy, making them both impossible at all scales. On the other hand, it leads to novel implicit ways for modeling noise at larger scales and to various predictions on the behavior of noisy quantum systems. "
"We report on a study of the supersymmetric anharmonic oscillator computed using a euclidean lattice path integral. Our numerical work utilizes a Fourier accelerated hybrid Monte Carlo scheme to sample the path integral. Using this we are able to measure massgaps and check Ward identities to a precision of better than one percent. We work with a non-standard lattice action which we show has an {\it exact} supersymmetry for arbitrary lattice spacing in the limit of zero interaction coupling. For the interacting model we show that supersymmetry is restored in the continuum limit without fine tuning. This is contrasted with the situation in which a `standard' lattice action is employed. In this case supersymmetry is not restored even in the limit of zero lattice spacing. Finally, we show how a minor modification of our action leads to an {\it exact}, local lattice supersymmetry even in the presence of interaction. "
"Relighting of human images has various applications in image synthesis. For relighting, we must infer albedo, shape, and illumination from a human portrait. Previous techniques rely on human faces for this inference, based on spherical harmonics (SH) lighting. However, because they often ignore light occlusion, inferred shapes are biased and relit images are unnaturally bright particularly at hollowed regions such as armpits, crotches, or garment wrinkles. This paper introduces the first attempt to infer light occlusion in the SH formulation directly. Based on supervised learning using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), we infer not only an albedo map, illumination but also a light transport map that encodes occlusion as nine SH coefficients per pixel. The main difficulty in this inference is the lack of training datasets compared to unlimited variations of human portraits. Surprisingly, geometric information including occlusion can be inferred plausibly even with a small dataset of synthesized human figures, by carefully preparing the dataset so that the CNNs can exploit the data coherency. Our method accomplishes more realistic relighting than the occlusion-ignored formulation. "
"A class of theories of gravity based on a Lagrangian which depends on the curvature and metric - but not on the derivatives of the curvature tensor - is of interest in several contexts including in the development of the paradigm that treats gravity as an emergent phenomenon. This class of models contains, as an important subset, all Lanczos-Lovelock models of gravity. I derive several identities and properties which are useful in the study of these models and clarify some of the issues that seem to have received insufficient attention in the past literature. "
"Newton seems to have stated a quantitative relationship between the position of a body in relative space and the position of the body in absolute space in the first scholium of his Principia. We show that if this suspected relationship is assumed to hold, it will dispel many errors and misrepresentations that have plagued Newton's ideas on absolute space since their inauguration. "
"Two models of loss networks, introduced by Gibbens et al. and by Antunes et al., are known to exhibit a mean field limiting regime with several stable equilibria. These models are reexamined in the light of Freidlin and Wentzell's large deviation approach of randomly perturbed dynamical systems. Assuming that some of their results still hold under slightly relaxed conditions, the metastability property is derived for both systems. A Lyapunov function exhibited by Antunes et al. is next identified with the quasipotential associated with a slightly modified, asymptotically reversible, Markovian perturbation of the same dynamical system. Another interpretation, in terms of entropy dissipation, of this Lyapunov function is finally given. The argument extends to another, similar but closed model. "
"The structure and vibrational spectrum of Gd3N@C80 is studied through Raman and inelastic electron tunneling spectroscopy (IETS) as well as density functional theory (DFT) and universal force field (UFF) calculations. Hindered rotations, shown by both theory and experiment, indicate the formation of a Gd3N-C80 bond which reduces the ideal icosahedral symmetry of the C80 cage. The vibrational modes involving the movement of the encapsulated species are a fingerprint of the interaction between the fullerene cage and the core complex. We present Raman data for the Gd3N@C2n (40 < n < 44) family as well as Y3N@C80, Lu3N@C80, and Y3N@C88 for comparison. Conductance measurements have been performed on Gd3N@C80 and reveal a Kondo effect similar to that observed in C60. "
"The continuous transition from a low resolution quantum nondemolition measurement of light field intensity to a precise measurement of photon number is described using a generalized measurement postulate. In the intermediate regime, quantization appears as a weak modulation of measurement probability. In this regime, the measurement result is strongly correlated with the amount of phase decoherence introduced by the measurement interaction. In particular, the accidental observation of half integer photon numbers preserves phase coherence in the light field, while the accidental observation of quantized values increases decoherence. The quantum mechanical nature of this correlation is discussed and the implications for the general interpretation of quantization are considered. "
"Tree-graded spaces are generalizations of R-trees. They appear as asymptotic cones of groups (when the cones have cut points). Since many questions about endomorphisms and automorphisms of groups, solving equations over groups, studying embeddings of a group into another group, etc. lead to actions of groups on the asymptotic cones, it is natural to consider actions of groups on tree-graded spaces. We develop a theory of such actions which generalizes the well known theory of groups acting on R-trees. As applications of our theory, we describe, in particular, relatively hyperbolic groups with infinite groups of outer automorphisms, and co-Hopfian relatively hyperbolic groups. "
"The inner Milky Way is dominated by a boxy, triaxial bulge which is believed to have formed through disk instability processes. Despite its proximity, its large-scale properties are still not very well known, due to our position in the obscuring Galactic disk. Here we make a measurement of the three-dimensional density distribution of the Galactic bulge using red clump giants identified in DR1 of the VVV survey. Our density map covers the inner (2.2x1.4x1.1)kpc of the bulge/bar. Line-of-sight density distributions are estimated by deconvolving extinction and completeness corrected K-band magnitude distributions. In constructing our measurement, we assume that the three-dimensional bulge is 8-fold mirror triaxially symmetric. In doing so we measure the angle of the bar-bulge to the line-of-sight to be (27+- 2)deg, where the dominant error is systematic arising from the details of the deconvolution process. The resulting density distribution shows a highly elongated bar with projected axis ratios ~(1:2.1) for isophotes reaching ~2kpc along the major axis. Along the bar axes the density falls off roughly exponentially, with axis ratios (10:6.3:2.6) and exponential scale-lengths (0.70:0.44:0.18)kpc. From about 400pc above the Galactic plane, the bulge density distribution displays a prominent X-structure. Overall, the density distribution of the Galactic bulge is characteristic for a strongly boxy/peanut shaped bulge within a barred galaxy. "
In this work we prove the existence of Fathi's weak KAM solutions for periodic Lagrangians and give a construction of all of them.
"Clean and interacting periodically driven quantum systems are believed to exhibit a single, trivial ""infinite-temperature"" Floquet-ergodic phase. In contrast, here we show that their disordered Floquet many-body localized counterparts can exhibit distinct ordered phases delineated by sharp transitions. Some of these are analogs of equilibrium states with broken symmetries and topological order, while others - genuinely new to the Floquet problem - are characterized by order and non-trivial periodic dynamics. We illustrate these ideas in driven spin chains with Ising symmetry. "
"In arXiv:1705.00745, an initial state ""parton model"" of quarks scattering off a dense nuclear target was shown to qualitatively reproduce the systematics of multiparticle azimuthal anisotropy cumulants measured in proton/deuteron-nucleus ($pA$) collisions at RHIC and the LHC. The systematics included i) the behavior of the four-particle cumulant $c_2\{4\}$, which generates a real four-particle second Fourier harmonic $v_2\{4\}$, ii) the ordering $v_2\{2\}>v_2\{4\}\approx v_2\{6\}\approx v_2\{8\}$ for two-, four-, six-, and eight-particle Fourier harmonics, iii) the behavior of so-called symmetric cumulants $\text{SC}(2,3)$ and $\text{SC}(2,4)$. These features of azimuthal multiparticle cumulants were previously interpreted as a signature of hydrodynamic flow; our results challenge this interpretation. We expand here upon our previous study and present further details and novel results on the saturation scale and transverse momentum ($p_\perp$) dependence of multiparticle azimuthal correlations. We find that the dependence of $v_2\{2\}$ and $v_2\{4\}$ on the number of color domains in the target varies with the $p_\perp$ window explored. We extend our prior discussion of symmetric cumulants and compute as yet unmeasured symmetric cumulants. We investigate the $N_c$ dependence of $v_2\{2\}$ and $v_2\{4\}$. We contrast our results, which include multiple scatterings of each quark off the target, to the Glasma graph approximation, where each quark suffers at most two gluon exchanges with the target. We find that coherent multiple scattering is essential to obtain a positive definite $v_2\{4\}$. We provide an algorithm to compute expectation values of arbitrary products of the ""dipole"" lightlike Wilson line correlators. "
"Understanding the underlying structure of building surfaces like walls and floors is essential when carrying out building maintenance and modification work. To facilitate such work, this paper introduces a capacitive sensor-based technology which can conduct non-destructive evaluation of building surfaces. The novelty of this sensor is that it can generate a real-time 2D subsurface image which can be used to understand structure beneath the top surface. Finite Element Analysis (FEA) simulations are done to understand the best sensor head configuration that gives optimum results. Hardware and software components are custom-built to facilitate real-time imaging capability. The sensor is validated by laboratory tests, which revealed the ability of the proposed capacitive sensing technology to see through common building materials like wood and concrete. The 2D image generated by the sensor is found to be useful in understanding the subsurface structure beneath the top surface. "
"This note is an extended abstract of my talk at the workshop on Representation Theory and Symmetric Functions, MSRI, April 14, 1997. We discuss the problem of finding an explicit description of the semigroup $LR_r$ of triples of partitions of length $\leq r$ such that the corresponding Littlewood-Richardson coefficient is non-zero. After discussing the history of the problem and previously known results, we suggest a new approach based on the ``polyhedral'' combinatorial expressions for the Littlewood-Richardson coefficients. "
"We consider the performance of the foremost academic House of Representatives forecasting models in the 2018 elections. In creating open-source implementations of these models, we outline key underlying assumptions. We find that although the results were unsurprising, they indicate a weakening of many traditional forecasting indicators. "
"The concept of infinity took centuries to achieve recognized status in the field of mathematics, despite the fact that it was implicitly present in nearly all mathematical endeavors. Here I explore the idea that a similar development might be warranted in physics. Several threads will be speculatively examined, including some involving nonstandard analysis. While there are intriguing possibilities, there also are noteworthy difficulties. "
"Because of the existence of cubic scalar couplings, there are in general nondecoupling effects at tree level in the scalar sector of any theory with two or more very different mass scales. We show this explicitly in the minimal nonsupersymmetric SU(5) model of grand unification. We show also how tree-level decoupling is guaranteed if supersymmetry is imposed. On the other hand, if the gauge symmetry is larger than that of the standard model at the mass scale of supersymmetry breaking, the two-Higgs-doublet structure at the presumably lower electroweak energy scale will be different from that of the minimal supersymmetric standard model, as shown already previuosly in a number od specific examples. We add here one example involving four Higgs doublets. "
"We consider spaces of high-energy quasimodes for the Laplacian on a compact hyperbolic surface, and show that when the spaces are large enough, one can find quasimodes that exhibit strong localization phenomena. Namely, take any constant c, and a sequence of (cr_j)-dimensional spaces S_j of quasimodes, where 1/4+r_j^2 is an approximate eigenvalue for S_j. Then we can find a vector psi_j in each S_j, such that any weak-* limit point of the microlocal lifts of |psi_j|^2 localizes a positive proportion of its mass on a singular set of codimension 1. This result is sharp, in light of recent joint work with E. Lindenstrauss, proving QUE for certain joint quasimodes that include spaces of size o(r_j) with arbitrarily slow decay. "
"We have generated accurate V and I template light curves using a combination of Fourier decomposition and principal component analysis for a large sample of Cepheid light curves. Unlike previous studies, we include short period Cepheids and stars pulsating in the first overtone mode in our analysis. Extensive Monte Carlo simulations show that our templates can be used to precisely measure Cepheid magnitudes and periods, even in cases where there are few observational epochs. These templates are ideal for characterizing serendipitously discovered Cepheids and can be used in conjunction with surveys such as Pan-Starrs and LSST where the observational sampling may not be optimized for Cepheids. "
"We study semiresolutions of quasi-projective varieties with properties $G_1$, $S_2$, and seminormality. Equivalently, these are varieties $X$ with Serre's $S_2$ property, such that there exists an open subvariety $U$, with complement of codimension at least two, such that the only singularities of $U$ are (analytically) double normal crossings. Such varieties have been called ""demi-normal"" by Koll\'ar \cite{Kol13}. First, we discuss why these properties are ideal for the study of nonnormal varieties that appear in the birational classification of varieties. We define semiresolutions and provide examples to illustrate the procedure of gluing along the conductor as the fundamental tool in obtaining a semiresolution of $X$ from a resolution of its normalization. As an application of these methods, we discuss semirational singularities. Our main results are a semismooth Grauert-Riemenschneider vanishing theorem (Theorem 4.2) and a proof that the definition of semirational singularities does not depend on the semiresolution chosen (Theorem 4.3) . The smooth version of (4.2) first appeared in \cite{GR70}. We also explain why semirational singularities are, in particular, Cohen-Macaulay and DuBois. Finally, we discuss the role semiresolutions play in forming a nonnormal interpretation of the results of de Fernex and Hacon in \cite{dFH09}, where the $\mathbb{Q}$-Cartier hypothesis was found to be extraneous in the birational classification of normal varieties. "
"After briefly explaining the idea of photon structure functions (\f2gam\ , \flgam) I review the current theoretical and experimental developements in the subject of extraction of \qvph\ from a study of the Deep Inelastic Scattering (DIS). I then end by pointing out recent progress in getting information about the parton content of the photon from hard processes other than DIS. "
"Four months of quasi-simultaneous spectroscopic and photometric observations were used to study the variations of the photometric light curve, the evolution of the chromospheric activity from the H$\alpha$ and H$\beta$ lines, and the distribution of cool spots from Doppler maps. During our observations one side of the star was more active than the other. The equivalent width of the H$\alpha$ line from the least active hemisphere increased from ~0.7 {\AA} at the beginning of the observation to 1.0 {\AA} at the end. The basal emission of the most active hemisphere remained roughly constant at a H$\alpha$ EW of ~1.0 {\AA}. Intense flare activity was observed during the first twenty days, where at least four different events were detected. The line asymmetries of the H$\alpha$ line suggest that one of the flares could have produced a mass ejection with a maximum projected speed of $\mathrm{70\thinspace km\thinspace s^{-1}}$. The rotational modulation of the V-band photometry showed clear anti-correlation with the chromospheric activity. The difference in brightness between the opposite hemispheres decreased from 0.16 to 0.09 mag in two months. Three spots gradually moving apart from each other dominated the photospheric Doppler maps. The comparison between the maps and the H$\alpha$ line as the star rotates reveals the spatial coexistence of chromospheric H$\alpha$ emission and photospheric spots. Our results indicate that the active regions of LQ Hya can live for at least four months. The detected changes in the photometric light curve and the spectroscopic Doppler images seem to be more a consequence of the spatial redistribution of the active regions rather than due to changes in their strength. Only one of the active regions shows significant changes in its chromospheric emission. "
"We use tunneling spectroscopy to study the evolution of few-electron spin states in parallel InAs nanowire double quantum dots (QDs) as a function of level detuning and applied magnetic field. Compared to the much more studied serial configuration, parallel coupling of the QDs to source and drain greatly expands the probing range of excited state transport. Owing to a strong confinement, we can here isolate transport involving only the very first interacting single QD orbital pair. For the (2,0)-(1,1) charge transition, with relevance for spin-based qubits, we investigate the excited (1,1) triplet, and hybridization of the (2,0) and (1,1) singlets. An applied magnetic field splits the (1,1) triplet, and due to spin-orbit induced mixing with the (2,0) singlet, we clearly resolve transport through all triplet states near the avoided singlet-triplet crossings. Transport calculations, based on a simple model with one orbital on each QD, fully replicate the experimental data. Finally, we observe an expected mirrored symmetry between the 1-2 and 2-3 electron transitions resulting from the two-fold spin degeneracy of the orbitals. "
"Given a string $S$ of length $n$, the classic string indexing problem is to preprocess $S$ into a compact data structure that supports efficient subsequent pattern queries. In this paper we consider the basic variant where the pattern is given in compressed form and the goal is to achieve query time that is fast in terms of the compressed size of the pattern. This captures the common client-server scenario, where a client submits a query and communicates it in compressed form to a server. Instead of the server decompressing the query before processing it, we consider how to efficiently process the compressed query directly. Our main result is a novel linear space data structure that achieves near-optimal query time for patterns compressed with the classic Lempel-Ziv compression scheme. Along the way we develop several data structural techniques of independent interest, including a novel data structure that compactly encodes all LZ77 compressed suffixes of a string in linear space and a general decomposition of tries that reduces the search time from logarithmic in the size of the trie to logarithmic in the length of the pattern. "
"By performing molecular dynamics simulations of binary Lennard-Jones systems with three different potentials, we show that increase of anharmonicity and capacity for intermolecular coupling of the potential is the cause of (i) the increase of kinetic fragility and nonexponentiality in the liquid state, (ii) the Tg-scaled temperature dependence of the nonergodicity parameter determined by the vibrations at low temperatures in the glassy state. Naturally these parameters correlate with each other, as observed experimentally by T. Scopigno et al., Science 302, 849 (2003). "
"We develop a surface hopping algorithm based on frozen Gaussian approximation for semiclassical matrix Schr\""odinger equations, in the spirit of Tully's fewest switches surface hopping method. The algorithm is asymptotically derived from the Schr\""odinger equation with rigorous approximation error analysis. The resulting algorithm can be viewed as a path integral stochastic representation of the semiclassical matrix Schr\""odinger equations. Our results provide mathematical understanding to and shed new light on the important class of surface hopping methods in theoretical and computational chemistry. "
"Let $\Sigma$ be a compact Riemann surface and $\h_{d,k}(\Sigma)$ denote the space of degree $d\geq 1$ holomorphic maps $\Sigma\ra \CP^k$. In theoretical physics this arises as the moduli space of charge $d$ lumps (or instantons) in the $\CP^k$ model on $\Sigma$. There is a natural Riemannian metric on this moduli space, called the $L^2$ metric, whose geometry is conjectured to control the low energy dynamics of $\CP^k$ lumps. In this paper an explicit formula for the $L^2$ metric on of $\h_{d,k}(\Sigma)$ in the special case $d=1$ and $\Sigma=S^2$ is computed. Essential use is made of the k\""ahler property of the $L^2$ metric, and its invariance under a natural action of $G=U(k+1)\times U(2)$. It is shown that {\em all} $G$-invariant k\""ahler metrics on $\h_{1,k}(S^2)$ have finite volume for $k\geq 2$. The volume of $\h_{1,k}(S^2)$ with respect to the $L^2$ metric is computed explicitly and is shown to agree with a general formula for $\h_{d,k}(\Sigma)$ recently conjectured by Baptista. The area of a family of twice punctured spheres in $\h_{d,k}(\Sigma)$ is computed exactly, and a formal argument is presented in support of Baptista's formula for $\h_{d,k}(S^2)$ for all $d$, $k$, and $\h_{2,1}(T^2)$.

"Coherent Rashba spin precession along interacting multi-mode quantum channels is investigated, revisiting the theory of coupled Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids. We identify susceptibilities as the key-parameters to govern exponents and Rashba precession lengths. In semiconducting quantum wires spins of different transport channels are found to {\em dephase} in their respective precession angles with respect to one another, as a result of the interaction. This could explain the experimental difficulty to realize the Datta Das transistor. In single walled carbon nanotubes, on the other hand, interactions are predicted to suppress dephasing between the two flavor modes at small doping. "
"In this proceedings we present STAR measurements of two particle azimuthal correlations between trigger particles at mid-rapidity ($|\eta|<$ 1) and associated particles at forward rapidities (2.7 $<|\eta|<$ 3.9) in p+p, d+Au and Au+Au collisions at $\sqrt{s_{NN}} $= 200 GeV. Two particle azimuthal correlations between a mid-rapidity trigger particle and forward-rapidity associated particles preferably probe large-x quarks scattered off small-x gluons in RHIC collisions. Comparison of the separate d- and Au-side measurements in d+Au collisions may potentially probe gluon saturation and the presence of Color Glass Condensate. In Au+Au collisions quark energy loss can be probed at large rapidities, which may be different from gluon energy loss measured at mid-rapidity. "
"We use Poisson summation formula to calculate integrals of producs of sinc functions (cf. [4]) and related integrals as in [5] and [3]. We also generalize the one in [5] and introduce other remarkable integrals. Finally we give a sum version of Siegel-type lower bound. (cf. [2], Theorem 3) "
"Multistate dark matter (DM) models with small mass splittings and couplings to light hidden sector bosons have been proposed as an explanation for the PAMELA/Fermi/H.E.S.S. high-energy lepton excesses. We investigate this proposal over a wide range of DM density profiles, in the framework of concrete models with doublet or triplet dark matter and a hidden SU(2) gauge sector that mixes with standard model hypercharge. The gauge coupling is bounded from below by the DM relic density, and the Sommerfeld enhancement factor is explicitly computable for given values of the DM and gauge boson masses M, mu and the (largest) dark matter mass splitting delta M_{12}. Sommerfeld enhancement is stronger at the galactic center than near the Sun because of the radial dependence of the DM velocity profile, which strengthens the inverse Compton (IC) gamma ray constraints relative to usual assumptions. We find that the PAMELA/Fermi/H.E.S.S. lepton excesses are marginally compatible with the model predictions, and with CMB and Fermi gamma ray constraints, for M ~ 800 GeV, mu ~ 200 MeV, and a dark matter profile with noncuspy Einasto parameters alpha > 0.20, r_s ~ 30 kpc. We also find that the annihilating DM must provide only a subdominant (< 0.4) component of the total DM mass density, since otherwise the boost factor due to Sommerfeld enhancement is too large. "
"In the first part of the paper we study stochastic integrals of a nonrandom function with respect to a nonorthogonal Hilbert noise defined on a semiring of subsets of an arbitrary nonempty set. In the second part we apply this construction to study limit behavior of canonical (i.e., degenerate) Von Mises statistics based on weakly dependent stationary observations. "
"We study a pair of commuting difference operators arising from the elliptic solution of the dynamical Yang-Baxter equation of type C_2. The operators act on the space of meromorphic functions on the weight space of sp(4,C). We show that these operators can be identified with the system by van Diejen and by Komori-Hikami with special parameters. It turns out that our case can be related to the difference Lame operator (two-body Ruijsenaars operator) and thereby we diagonalize the system on the finite dimensional space spanned by the level one characters of the C_2^{(1)}-affine Lie algebra. "
"The most general geometrical scenario in which the brane-world program can be implemented is investigated. The basic requirement is that it should be consistent with the confinement of gauge interaction, the existence of quantum states and the embedding in a bulk with arbitrary dimensions, signature and topology. It is found that the embedding equations are compatible with a wide class of Lagrangians, starting with a modified Einstein-Hilbert Lagrangian as the simplest one, provided minimal boundaries are added to the bulk. A non-trivial canonical structure is derived, suggesting a canonical quantization of the brane-world geometry relative to the extra dimensions, where the quantum states are set in correspondence with high frequency gravitational waves. It is shown that in the cases of at least six dimensions, there exists a confined gauge field included in the embedding structure. The size of extra dimensions compatible with the embedding is calculated and found to be different from the one derived with product topology. "
"In biochemically reactive systems with small copy numbers of one or more reactant molecules, the dynamics is dominated by stochastic effects. To approximate those systems, discrete state-space and stochastic simulation approaches have been shown to be more relevant than continuous state-space and deterministic ones. In systems characterized by having simultaneously fast and slow timescales, existing discrete space-state stochastic path simulation methods, such as the stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA) and the explicit tau-leap (Explicit-TL) method, can be very slow. Implicit approximations have been developed to improve numerical stability and provide efficient simulation algorithms for those systems. Here, we propose an efficient Multilevel Monte Carlo (MLMC) method in the spirit of the work by Anderson and Higham (2012). This method uses split-step implicit tau-leap (SSI-TL) at levels where the SSI-TL method is not applicable due to numerical stability issues. We present numerical examples that illustrate the performance of the proposed method. "
"We report new HST/WFPC2 photometry for 10 globular clusters (GC) in M31 observed in F5555W(V) and F814W(I). Additionally we have reanalyzed HST archival data of comparable quality for 2 more GCs. Extraordinary care is taken to account for the effects of blended stellar images and required field subtraction. We thus reach 1 mag fainter than the horizontal branch (HB) even in unfavorable cases. We present the color-magnitude diagrams (CMDs) and discuss their main features also in comparison with the properties of the Galactic GCs. This analysis is augmented with CMDs previously obtained and discussed by Fusi Pecci et al. (1996) on 8 other M31 clusters. We report the following significant results: 1. The locus of the red giant branches give reliable metallicity determinations which compare generally very well with ground-based integrated spectroscopic and photometric measures, as well as giving good reddening estimates. 2. The HB morphologies show the same behavior with metallicity as the Galactic GCs, with indications that the 2nd-parameter effect can be present in some GCs of our sample. However, at [Fe/H] ~ -1.7 we observe a number of GCs with red HB morphology such that the HB type versus [Fe/H] relation is offset from the MW and resembles that of the Fornax dwarf spheroidal galaxy. One explanation for the offset is that they are younger than their MW counterparts by 1-2 Gyr. 3. The Mv(HB)-[Fe/H] relationship has been determined and the slope (~0.20) is very similar to the values derived from RR Lyrae stars in the MW and the LMC. The zero-point of this relation based on the assumed distance modulus (m-M)o(M31)=24.47+/-0.03 is consistent with (m-M)o(LMC)=18.55. "
"In this paper a countable family of new compactly supported {\em non-Haar} $p$-adic wavelet bases in ${\cL}^2(\bQ_p^n)$ is constructed. We use the wavelet bases in the following applications: in the theory of $p$-adic pseudo-differential operators and equations. Namely, we study the connections between wavelet analysis and spectral analysis of $p$-adic pseudo-differential operators. A criterion for a multidimensional $p$-adic wavelet to be an eigenfunction for a pseudo-differential operator is derived. We prove that these wavelets are eigenfunctions of the fractional operator. In addition, $p$-adic wavelets are used to construct solutions of linear and semi-linear pseudo-differential equations. Since many $p$-adic models use pseudo-differential operators (fractional operator), these results can be intensively used in these models. "
"We consider a particular type of matrices which belong at the same time to the class of Hessenberg and Toeplitz matrices, and whose determinants are equal to the number of a type of compositions of natural numbers. We prove a formula in which the number of weak compositions with a fixed number of zeroes is expressed in terms of the number of compositions without zeroes. Then we find a relationship between weak compositions and coefficients of characteristic polynomials of appropriate matrices. Finally, we prove three explicit formulas for weak compositions of a special kind. "
"In order to face environmental constraints, trees are able to re-orient their axes by controlling the stress level in the newly formed wood layers. Angiosperms and gymnosperms evolved into two distinct mechanisms: the former produce a wood with large tension pre-stress on the upper side of the tilted axis, while the latter produce a wood with large compression pre-stress on the lower side. In both cases, the difference between this stress level and that of the opposite side, in light tension, generates the bending of the axis. However, light values of compression were sometimes measured in the opposite side of angiosperms. By analysing old data on chestnut and mani and new data on poplar, this study shows that these values were not measurement artefacts. This reveals that generating light compression stress in opposite wood contributes to improve the performance of the re-orientation mechanism. "
"Intrinsic toroidal rotation in a tokamak can be driven by turbulent momentum transport due to neoclassical flow effects breaking a symmetry of turbulence. In this paper we categorize the contributions due to neoclassical effects to the turbulent momentum transport, and evaluate each contribution using gyrokinetic simulations. We find that the relative importance of each contribution changes with collisionality. For low collisionality, the dominant contributions come from neoclassical particle and parallel flows. For moderate collisionality, there are non- negligible contributions due to neoclassical poloidal electric field and poloidal gradients of density and temperature, which are not important for low collisionality. "
"We propose an effective online background subtraction method, which can be robustly applied to practical videos that have variations in both foreground and background. Different from previous methods which often model the foreground as Gaussian or Laplacian distributions, we model the foreground for each frame with a specific mixture of Gaussians (MoG) distribution, which is updated online frame by frame. Particularly, our MoG model in each frame is regularized by the learned foreground/background knowledge in previous frames. This makes our online MoG model highly robust, stable and adaptive to practical foreground and background variations. The proposed model can be formulated as a concise probabilistic MAP model, which can be readily solved by EM algorithm. We further embed an affine transformation operator into the proposed model, which can be automatically adjusted to fit a wide range of video background transformations and make the method more robust to camera movements. With using the sub-sampling technique, the proposed method can be accelerated to execute more than 250 frames per second on average, meeting the requirement of real-time background subtraction for practical video processing tasks. The superiority of the proposed method is substantiated by extensive experiments implemented on synthetic and real videos, as compared with state-of-the-art online and offline background subtraction methods. "
"We consider right handed neutrino emission from charged and neutral pion condensate matter likely to be present in the supernova core associated with SN 1987 A. This is used to constrain the strength of right handed interaction and we get excluded range of values for the right handed $W$ boson and extra neutral $Z'$ boson masses. For vanishing $W_L-W_R$ mixing we obtain $ (1.3-1.8)\,M_{W_L} \,\approx \leq\,M_{W_R} \, \leq\approx 100\, M_{W_L} \, {\rm and}\, (1.3-1.8)\,M_{W_L}\, \approx \leq \, M_{N'}\,\leq\approx \,225 \,M_{W_L}$ "
"Rubidium 87 atoms are trapped in an Ioffe-Pritchard potential generated with a persistent supercurrent that flows in a loop circuit patterned on a sapphire surface. The superconducting circuit is a closed loop made of 100 micro meter wide MBE-grown MgB2 stripe carrying a supercurrent of 2.5 A. To control the supercurrent in the stripe, an on-chip thermal switch operated by a focused argon-ion laser is developed. The switch operates as an on/off switch of the supercurrent, or as a device to set the current to a specific value with the aid of an external magnetic field. The current can be set even without an external source if the change is in decreasing direction. "
We prove a formula for the Segre classes of monomial schemes as integrals over suitable Newton regions.
"We study new classes three dimensional black hole solutions of Einstein equations written in two holonomic and one anholonomic variables with respect to anholonomic frames Thermodynamic properties of such (2+1)-black holes with generic local anisotropy (having elliptitic horizons) are studied by applying geometric methods. The corresponding thermodynamic systems are three dimensional with entropy S being a hypersurface function on mass M, anisotropy angle $\theta$ and eccentricity of elliptic deformations $\epsilon >.$ Two-dimensional curved thermodynamic geometries for locally anistropic deformed black holes are constructed after integration on anisotropic parameter $\theta$. Two approaches, the first one based on two-dimensional hypersurface parametric geometry and the second one developed in a Ruppeiner-Mrugala-Janyszek fashion, are analyzed. The thermodynamic curvatures are computed and the critical points of curvature vanishing are defined. "
"This article is based on the covariant canonical formalism and corresponding symplectic structure on phase space developed by Witten, Zuckerman and others in the context of field theory. After recalling the basic principles of this procedure, we construct the conserved bilinear symplectic current for generic elastic string models. These models describe current carrying cosmic strings evolving in an arbitrary curved background spacetime. Particular attention is paid to the special case of the chiral string for which the worldsheet current is null. Different formulations of the chiral string action are discussed in detail, and as a result the integrability property of the chiral string is clarified. "
Different hydrodynamic regimes for the gaseous outflows generated by multiple supernovae explosions and stellar winds occurring within compact and massive star clusters are discussed. It is shown that there exists the threshold energy that separates clusters whose outflows evolve in the quasi-adiabatic or radiative regime from those within which catastrophic cooling and a positive feedback star-forming mode sets in. The role of the surrounding ISM and the observational appearance of the star cluster winds evolving in different hydrodynamic regimes are also discussed.
"In the present work, metrics which lead to projected closed orbits are found by comparing the relativistic differential equation of orbits with the corresponding classical differential equation. Physical and geometrical properties of these peculiar spacetimes are derived and discussed. It is also shown that some of these spacetimes belong to the broader class of the Bertrand spacetimes. "

"We prove that the irreducible components of the space of framed deformations of the trivial 2-dimensional mod 2 representation of the absolute Galois group of Q_2 are in natural bijection with those of the trivial character, confirming a conjecture of B\""ockle. We deduce from this result that crystalline points are Zariski dense in that space: this provides the missing ingredient for the surjectivity of the p-adic local Langlands correspondence for GL_2(Q_p) in the case p=2 (the result was already known for p\geq 3). "
"Pervasive computing appears like a new computing era based on networks of objects and devices evolving in a real world, radically different from distributed computing, based on networks of computers and data storages. Contrary to most context-aware approaches, we work on the assumption that pervasive software must be able to deal with a dynamic software environment before processing contextual data. After demonstrating that SOA (Service oriented Architecture) and its numerous principles are well adapted for pervasive computing, we present our extended SOA model for pervasive computing, called Service Lightweight Component Architecture (SLCA). SLCA presents various additional principles to meet completely pervasive software constraints: software infrastructure based on services for devices, local orchestrations based on lightweight component architecture and finally encapsulation of those orchestrations into composite services to address distributed composition of services. We present a sample application of the overall approach as well as some relevant measures about SLCA performances. "
"Recently it has been shown that the spinnless one particle quantum mechanics can be obtained in the framework of entirely classical subquantum kinetics. In the present paper we argue that, within the same scheme and without any extra assumption, it is possible to obtain both the non relativistic quantum mechanics with spin, in the presence of an arbitrary external electromagnetic field, as well as the nonlinear quantum mechanics.

"Maintaining balance while walking is not a simple task for a humanoid robot because of its complex dynamics. The presence of a persistent disturbance makes this task even more challenging, as it can cause a loss of balance and ultimately lead the the robot to a fall. In this paper, we extend our previously proposed Intrinsically Stable MPC (IS-MPC), which guarantees boundedness of the CoM with respect to the ZMP, to the case of persistent disturbances. This is achieved by designing a disturbance observer whose estimate is used to compute a modified stability constraint included in the QP problem formulation. The method is validated by MATLAB simulations for the LIP as well as dynamic simulations for a NAO humanoid in DART. "
"We address the problem of including Coulomb distortion effects in inclusive quasielastic (e,e') reactions using the eikonal approximation. Our results indicate that Coulomb corrections may become large for heavy nuclei for certain kinematical regions. The issues of our model are presented in detail and the results are compared to calculations of the Ohio group, where Dirac wave functions were used both for electrons and nucleons. Our results are in good agreement with those obtained by exact calculations. "
"Using the IRAM Plateau de Bure Interferometer, we report the detection of the 158 micron [CII] emission line and underlying dust continuum in the host galaxy of the quasar ULAS J112001.48+064124.3 (hereafter J1120+0641) at z=7.0842+/-0.0004. This is the highest redshift detection of the [CII] line to date, and allows us to put first constraints on the physical properties of the host galaxy. The [CII] line luminosity is (1.2+/-0.2)x10^9 Lsun, which is a factor ~4 lower than observed in a luminous quasar at z=6.42 (SDSS J1148+5251). The underlying far-infrared (FIR) continuum has a flux density of 0.61+/-0.16 mJy, similar to the average flux density of z~6 quasars that were not individually detected in the rest-frame FIR. Assuming the FIR luminosity of L_FIR = 5.8x10^11-1.8x10^12 Lsun is mainly powered by star-formation, we derive a star-formation rate in the range 160-440 Msun/yr and a total dust mass in the host galaxy of 6.7x10^7-5.7x10^8 Msun (both numbers have significant uncertainties given the unknown nature of dust at these redshifts). The [CII] line width of sigma_V=100+/-15 km/s is among the smallest observed when compared to the molecular line widths detected in z~6 quasars. Both the [CII] and dust continuum emission are spatially unresolved at the current angular resolution of 2.0x1.7 arcsec^2 (corresponding to 10x9 kpc^2 at the redshift of J1120+0641). "
"We have developed x-ray diffraction measurements with high energy-resolution and accuracy to study water structure at three different temperatures (7, 25 and 66 C) under normal pressure. Using a spherically curved Ge crystal an energy resolution better than 15 eV has been achieved which eliminates influence from Compton scattering. The high quality of the data allows a precise oxygen-oxygen pair correlation function (PCF) to be directly derived from the Fourier transform of the experimental data resolving shell structure out to ~12 {\AA}, i.e. 5 hydration shells. Large-scale molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using the TIP4P/2005 force-field reproduce excellently the experimental shell-structure in the range 4-12 {\AA} although less agreement is seen for the first peak in the PCF. The Local Structure Index [J. Chem. Phys. 104, 7671 (1996)] identifies a tetrahedral minority giving the intermediate-range oscillations in the PCF and a disordered majority providing a more featureless background in this range. The current study supports the proposal that the structure of liquid water, even at high temperatures, can be described in terms of a two-state fluctuation model involving local structures related to the high-density and low-density forms of liquid water postulated in the liquid-liquid phase transition hypothesis. "
"In this paper, we study quotients of groupoids and coarse moduli spaces of stacks in a general setting. Geometric quotients are not always categorical, but we present a natural topological condition under which a geometric quotient is categorical. We also show the existence of geometric quotients of finite flat groupoids and give explicit local descriptions. Exploiting similar methods, we give an easy proof of the existence of quotients of flat groupoids with finite stabilizers. As the proofs do not use noetherian methods and are valid for general algebraic spaces and algebraic stacks, we obtain a slightly improved version of Keel and Mori's theorem. "
"As the development of electronic science and technology, electronic data acquisition (DAQ) system is more and more widely applied to nuclear physics experiments. Workstations are often utilized for data storage, data display, data processing and data analysis by researchers. Nevertheless, the workstations are ordinarily separated from detectors in nuclear physics experiments by several kilometers or even tens of kilometers. Thus a DAQ system that can transmit data for long distance is in demand. In this paper, we designed a DAQ system suitable for high-speed and high-precision sampling for remote data transfer. An 8-channel, 24-bit simultaneous sampling analog-to-digital converter(ADC) named AD7779 was utilized for high-speed and high-precision sampling, the maximum operating speed of which runs up to 16 kilo samples per second(KSPS). ADC is responsible for collecting signals from detectors, which is sent to Field Programmable Gate Array(FPGA) for processing and long-distance transmission to the workstation through optical fiber. As the central processing unit of DAQ system, FPGA provides powerful computing capability and has enough flexibility. The most prominent feature of the system is real-time mass data transfer based on streaming transmission mode, highly reliable data transmission based on error detection and correction and high-speed high-precision data acquisition. The results of our tests show that the system is able to transmit data stably at the bandwidth of 1Gbps. "
"The persistent proximity of insulating and metallic phases, a puzzling characterestic of manganites, is argued to arise from the self organization of the twofold degenerate e_g orbitals of Mn into localized Jahn-Teller(JT) polaronic levels and broad band states due to the large electron - JT phonon coupling present in them. We describe a new two band model with strong correlations and a dynamical mean-field theory calculation of equilibrium and transport properties. These explain the insulator metal transition and colossal magnetoresistance quantitatively, as well as other consequences of two state coexistence. "
"The goal of this note is to apply ideas from commutative algebra (a.k.a. affine algebraic geometry) to the question of constrained Nevanlinna-Pick interpolation. More precisely, we consider subalgebras $A \subset \mathbb{C}[z_1,\ldots,z_d]$, such that the map from the affine space to the spectrum of $A$ is an isomorphism except for finitely many points. Letting $\mathfrak{A}$ be the weak-$*$ closure of $A$ in $\mathcal{M}_d$ -- the multiplier algebra of the Drury-Arveson space. We provide a parametrization for the Nevanlinna-Pick family of $M_k(\mathfrak{A})$ for $k \geq 1$. In particular, when $k=1$ the parameter space for the Nevanlinna-Pick family is the Picard group of $A$. "
"We study the validity of a relation by Drell, Levy and Yan (DLY) connecting the deep inelastic structure (DIS) functions and the single-particle fragmentation functions in $e^+e^-$ annihilation which are defined in the spacelike ($q^2<0$) and timelike ($q^2>0$) regions, with respect to physical evolution kernels for the two processes to $O(\alpha_s^2)$. We also comment on a relation proposed by Gribov and Lipatov. "
"By generalizing Gessel-Xin's Laurent series method for proving the Zeilberger-Bressoud $q$-Dyson Theorem, we establish a family of $q$-Dyson style constant term identities. These identities give explicit formulas for certain coefficients of the $q$-Dyson product, including three conjectures of Sills' as special cases and generalizing Stembridge's first layer formulas for characters of $SL(n,\mathbb{C})$. "
"We consider the radial geodesic motion of a massive particle into a black hole in isotropic coordinates, which represents the exterior region of an Einstein-Rosen bridge (wormhole). The particle enters the interior region, which is regular and physically equivalent to the asymptotically flat exterior of a white hole, and the particle's proper time extends to infinity. Since the radial motion into a wormhole after passing the event horizon is physically different from the motion into a Schwarzschild black hole, Einstein-Rosen and Schwarzschild black holes are different, physical realizations of general relativity. Yet for distant observers, both solutions are indistinguishable. We show that timelike geodesics in the field of a wormhole are complete because the expansion scalar in the Raychaudhuri equation has a discontinuity at the horizon, and because the Einstein-Rosen bridge is represented by the Kruskal diagram with Rindler's elliptic identification of the two antipodal future event horizons. These results suggest that observed astrophysical black holes may be Einstein-Rosen bridges, each with a new universe inside that formed simultaneously with the black hole. Accordingly, our own Universe may be the interior of a black hole existing inside another universe. "
"In this work we study the influence of an electric field on stripes and compare our results with experimental findings from scanning tunneling microscope measurements. By introducing a negative-bias electric field into a time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation with stable stripe solutions, we show that hole(electron)-like stripes widen (narrow) compared to the field free case. When a magnetic field is introduced instead, stripe formation is found to be suppressed. "
"We analyze the problem of sequential probability assignment for binary outcomes with side information and logarithmic loss, where regret---or, redundancy---is measured with respect to a (possibly infinite) class of experts. We provide upper and lower bounds for minimax regret in terms of sequential complexities of the class. These complexities were recently shown to give matching (up to logarithmic factors) upper and lower bounds for sequential prediction with general convex Lipschitz loss functions (Rakhlin and Sridharan, 2015). To deal with unbounded gradients of the logarithmic loss, we present a new analysis that employs a sequential chaining technique with a Bernstein-type bound. The introduced complexities are intrinsic to the problem of sequential probability assignment, as illustrated by our lower bound. We also consider an example of a large class of experts parametrized by vectors in a high-dimensional Euclidean ball (or a Hilbert ball). The typical discretization approach fails, while our techniques give a non-trivial bound. For this problem we also present an algorithm based on regularization with a self-concordant barrier. This algorithm is of an independent interest, as it requires a bound on the function values rather than gradients. "
"Hand segmentation and fingertip detection play an indispensable role in hand gesture-based human-machine interaction systems. In this study, we propose a method to discriminate hand components and to locate fingertips in RGB-D images. The system consists of three main steps: hand detection using RGB images providing regions which are considered as promising areas for further processing, hand segmentation, and fingertip detection using depth image and our modified SegNet, a single lightweight architecture that can process two independent tasks at the same time. The experimental results show that our system is a promising method for hand segmentation and fingertip detection which achieves a comparable performance while model complexity is suitable for real-time applications. "
"Cooperation between the primary and secondary systems can improve the spectrum efficiency in cognitive radio networks. The key idea is that the secondary system helps to boost the primary system's performance by relaying and in return the primary system provides more opportunities for the secondary system to access the spectrum. In contrast to most of existing works that only consider information cooperation, this paper studies joint information and energy cooperation between the two systems, i.e., the primary transmitter sends information for relaying and feeds the secondary system with energy as well. This is particularly useful when the secondary transmitter has good channel quality to the primary receiver but is energy constrained. We propose and study three schemes that enable this cooperation. Firstly, we assume there exists an ideal backhaul between the two systems for information and energy transfer. We then consider two wireless information and energy transfer schemes from the primary transmitter to the secondary transmitter using power splitting and time splitting energy harvesting techniques, respectively. For each scheme, the optimal and zero-forcing solutions are derived. Simulation results demonstrate promising performance gain for both systems due to the additional energy cooperation. It is also revealed that the power splitting scheme can achieve larger rate region than the time splitting scheme when the efficiency of the energy transfer is sufficiently large. "
"We present the design of an optomechanical crystal nanobeam cavity that combines finite-element simulation with numerical optimization, and considers the optomechanical coupling arising from both moving dielectric boundaries and the photo-elastic effect. Applying this methodology results in a nanobeam with an experimentally realized intrinsic optical Q-factor of 1.2x10^6, a mechanical frequency of 5.1GHz, a mechanical Q-factor of 6.8x10^5 (at T=10K), and a zero-point-motion optomechanical coupling rate of g=1.1MHz. "
"Motivated by the bulk mixing $\xi R_5 H^{\dagger}H$ between a massive radion and a bulk scalar Higgs in warped extra dimensions, we construct an effective four dimensional action that---via the AdS/CFT correspondence---describes the most general mixing between the only light states in the theory, the dilaton and the Higgs. Due to conformal invariance, once the Higgs scalar is localized in the bulk of the extra-dimension the coupling between the dilaton and the Higgs kinetic term vanishes, implying a suppressed coupling between the dilaton and massive gauge bosons. We comment on the implications of the mixing and couplings to Standard Model particles. Identifying the recently discovered 125 GeV resonance with the lightest Higgs-like mixed state $\phi_{-}$, we study the phenomenology and constraints for the heaviest radion-like state $\phi_{+}$. In particular we find that in the small mixing scenario with a radion-like state $\phi_{+}$ in the mass range [150,250] GeV, the diphoton channel can provide the best chance of discovery at the LHC if the collaborations extend their searches into this energy range. "
"In this paper, an extension of raptor codes is introduced which keeps all the desirable properties of raptor codes, including the linear complexity of encoding and decoding per information bit, unchanged. The new design, however, improves the performance in terms of the reception rate. Our simulations show a 10% reduction in the needed overhead at the benchmark block length of 64,520 bits and with the same complexity per information bit. "
"We investigate the many-body dynamics of an effectively attractive one-dimensional Bose system confined in a toroidal trap. The mean-field theory predicts that a bright-soliton state will be formed when increasing the interparticle interaction over a critical point. The study of quantum many-body dynamics in this paper reveals that there is a modulation instability in a finite Bose system correspondingly. We show that Shannon entropy becomes irregular near and above the critical point due to quantum correlations. We also study the dynamical behavior of the instability by exploring the momentum distribution and the fringe visibility, which can be verified experimentally by releasing the trap "
"In the statistical description of dynamical systems, an indication of the irreversibility of a given state change is given geometrically by means of a (pre-)ordering of state pairs. Reversible state changes of classical and quantum systems are shown to be represented by isometric state transformations. An operational distinction between reversible and irreversible dynamics is given and related to the geometric characterisation of the associated state transformations. "
We demonstrate $|W\rangle$ state encoding of multi-atom ensemble qubits. Using optically trapped Rb atoms the $T_2$ coherence time is 2.6(3) ms for $\bar N=7.6$ atoms and scales approximately inversely with the number of atoms. Strong Rydberg blockade between two ensemble qubits is demonstrated with a fidelity of $0.89(1)$ and a fidelity of $\sim \hspace{-.05cm}1.0$ when postselected on control ensemble excitation. These results are a significant step towards deterministic entanglement of atomic ensembles.
"The CIII]{\lambda}{\lambda}1907, 1909 rest-frame UV emission doublet has recently been detected in galaxies during the epoch of reionization (z > 6), with high equivalent width (>10 {\AA}, rest frame). Currently, it is possible to obtain much more detailed information for star-forming galaxies at significantly lower redshift. Accordingly, studies of their far-UV spectra are useful for understanding the factors modulating the strength of CIII] emission. We present the first statistical sample of CIII] emission measurements in star-forming galaxies at z ~ 1. Our sample is drawn from the DEEP2 survey and spans the redshift 0.64 < z < 1.35 (<z> = 1.08). We find that the median equivalent width (EW) of individual CIII] detections in our sample (1.30 {\AA}) is much smaller than the typical value observed thus far at z > 6. Furthermore, out of 184 galaxies with coverage of CIII], only 40 have significant detections. Galaxies with individual CIII] detections have bluer colors and lower luminosities on average than those without, implying that strong CIII] emitters are in general young and low-mass galaxies without significant dust extinction. Using stacked spectra, we further investigate how CIII] strength correlates with multiple galaxy properties (M_B, U-B, M*, star-formation rate, specific star-formation rate) and rest-frame near-UV (FeII* and MgII) and optical [OIII] and H{\beta}) emission line strengths. These results provide a detailed picture of the physical environment in star-forming galaxies at z ~ 1, and motivate future observations of strong CIII] emitters at similar redshifts. "
"The number of approved patents worldwide increases rapidly each year, which requires new patent analytics to efficiently mine the valuable information attached to these patents. Vector space model (VSM) represents documents as high-dimensional vectors, where each dimension corresponds to a unique term. While originally proposed for information retrieval systems, VSM has also seen wide applications in patent analytics, and used as a fundamental tool to map patent documents to structured data. However, VSM method suffers from several limitations when applied to patent analysis tasks, such as loss of sentence-level semantics and curse-of-dimensionality problems. In order to address the above limitations, we propose a patent analytics based on feature vector space model (FVSM), where the FVSM is constructed by mapping patent documents to feature vectors extracted by convolutional neural networks (CNN). The applications of FVSM for three typical patent analysis tasks, i.e., patents similarity comparison, patent clustering, and patent map generation are discussed. A case study using patents related to Internet of Things (IoT) technology is illustrated to demonstrate the performance and effectiveness of FVSM. The proposed FVSM can be adopted by other patent analysis studies to replace VSM, based on which various big data learning tasks can be performed. "
"The dissipative mechanism at low current density is compared in three different classes of superconductors. This is achieved by measurement of resistance as a function of temperature and magnetic field in clean polycrystalline samples of NbSe2, MgB2 and Bi2Sr2Ca2Cu3O10 superconductors. Thermally activated flux flow behavior is clearly identified in bulk MgB2. While the activation energy at low fields for MgB2 is comparable to Bi2Sr2Ca2Cu3O10, its field dependence follows a parabolic behavior unlike a power law dependence seen in Bi2Sr2Ca2Cu3O10. We analyze our results based on the Kramer's scaling for grain boundary pinning in MgB2and NbSe2. "
The invariants of solvable Lie algebras with nilradicals isomorphic to the algebra of strongly upper triangular matrices and diagonal nilindependent elements are studied exhaustively. Bases of the invariant sets of all such algebras are constructed by an original purely algebraic algorithm based on Cartan's method of moving frames.
"In the age of high-resolution spectroscopic stellar surveys of the Milky Way, the number of stars with detailed abundances of multiple elements is rapidly increasing. These elemental abundances are directly influenced by the evolutionary history of the Galaxy, but this can be difficult to interpret without an absolute timeline of the abundance enrichment. We present age-abundance trends for [M/H], [{\alpha}/M], and 17 individual elements using a sample of 721 solar neighbourhood Hipparcos red giant stars observed by APOGEE. These age trends are determined through a Bayesian hierarchical modelling method presented by Feuillet et al. (2016). We confirm that the [{\alpha}/M]- age relation in the solar neighbourhood is steep and relatively narrow (0.20 dex age dispersion), as are the [O/M]- and [Mg/M]-age relations. The age trend of [C/N] is steep and smooth, consistent with stellar evolution. The [M/H]-age relation has a mean age dispersion of 0.28 dex and a complex overall structure. The oldest stars in our sample are those with the lowest and highest metallicities, while the youngest stars are those with solar metallicity. These results provide strong constraints on theoretical models of Galactic chemical evolution (GCE). We compare them to the predictions of one-zone GCE mod- els and multi-zone mixtures, both analytic and numerical. These comparisons support the hypothesis that the solar neighbourhood is composed of stars born at a range of Galactocentric radii, and that the most metal-rich stars likely migrated from a region with earlier and more rapid star formation such as the inner Galaxy. "
"Preliminary results are presented from a simple, single-antenna experiment designed to measure the all-sky radio spectrum between 100 and 200 MHz. The system used an internal comparison-switching scheme to reduce non-smooth instrumental contaminants in the measured spectrum to 75 mK. From the observations, we place an initial upper limit of 450 mK on the relative brightness temperature of the redshifted 21 cm contribution to the spectrum due to neutral hydrogen in the intergalactic medium (IGM) during the epoch of reionization, assuming a rapid transition to a fully ionized IGM at a redshift of 8. With refinement, this technique should be able to distinguish between slow and fast reionization scenarios. To constrain the duration of reionization to dz > 2, the systematic residuals in the measured spectrum must be reduced to 3 mK. "
"While observational cosmology has shown tremendous growth over the last decade, deep mysteries continue to haunt our theoretical understanding of the ingredients of the concordance cosmological model, which are mainly `dark'. More than 95 percent of the content of the energy-stress tensor has to be in the form of inflaton, dark matter and dark energy, which do not have any non-gravitational or laboratory evidence and remain unidentified. Moreover, the dark energy poses a serious confrontation between fundamental physics and cosmology. This makes a strong case to discover alternative theories which do not require the dark sectors of the standard approach to explain the observations. In the present situation, it would be important to gain insight about the requirements of the `would be' final theory from all possible means. In this context, the present paper highlights some, hitherto unnoticed, interesting coincidences which may prove useful to develop insight about the `holy grail' of gravitation. It appears that the requirement of the speculative dark sectors by the energy-stress tensor, is indicative of a possible way out of the present crisis appearing in the standard cosmology, in terms of a theory wherein the energy-stress tensor does not play a direct role in the dynamics. It is shown that various cosmological observations can be explained satisfactorily in the framework of one such theory $-$ the Milne model, without requiring the dark sectors of the standard approach. Moreover, the model evades the horizon, flatness and the cosmological constant problems afflicting the standard cosmology. Though Milne's theory is an incomplete, phenomenological theory, and cannot be the final theory of gravitation, nevertheless, it would be worthwhile to study these coincidences, which may help us develop insight about the would-be final theory.

"A model of polar fluid is studied theoretically. The interaction potential, in addition to dipole-dipole term, possesses a dispersion contribution of the van der Waals-London form. It is found that when the dispersion force is comparable to dipole-dipole interaction, the fluid separates into coexisting liquid and gas phases. The calculated critical parameters are in excellent agreement with Monte Carlo simulations. When the strength of dispersion attraction is bellow critical, no phase separation is found. "
"This work analyzes the discrete solution of Hughes-Hartogs (HH) for the transmission rate maximization problem with power constraint in the OFDMA systems and explores mechanisms to reduce the computational complexity of greedy algorithms. In addition to the solution characterization, a computational complexity analysis is developed, considering the number of executed operations for running time purpose. Moreover, we have compared the system capacity via the throughput obtained with the HH solution, and its variants combined with three complexity reduction mechanisms. These tools consist of an initial allocation bit vector calculated by rounding the results of the water-filling (WF) solution, the multiple subchannels per iteration updating, and the adoption of a subchannel grouping procedure. Our findings indicate that the update of multiple subchannels and the subcarriers grouping techniques reduce the number of iterations required for convergence of the original HH, with some throughput degradation. Also, the bit-allocation mechanism based on the WF is deployed as an alternative to overcome the HH solution, increasing the computational complexity. "
"Using adaptive optics at the ESO 3.6m telescope, we obtained diffraction limited JHK-images of the region around the Herbig AeBe star NX Pup. We clearly resolved the close companion (sep. 0.128"") to NX Pup -- originally discovered by HST -- and measured its JHK magnitudes. A third object at a separation of 7.0"" from NX Pup was identified as a classical T Tauri star so that NX Pup may in fact form a hierarchical triple system. We discuss the evolutionary status of these stars and derive estimates for their spectral types, luminosities, masses and ages. "
"In this report we focus on some aspects related to modeling and formal verification of embedded systems. Many models have been proposed to represent embedded systems. These models encompass a broad range of styles, characteristics, and application domains and include the extensions of finite state machines, data flow graphs, communication processes and Petri nets. In this report, we have used a PRES+ model (Petri net based Representation for Embedded Systems) as an extension of classical Petri net model that captures concurrency, timing behaviour of embedded systems; it allows systems to be representative in different levels of abstraction and improves expressiveness by allowing the token to carry information. Modeling using PRES+, as discussed above, may be convenient for specifying the input behaviour because it supports concurrency. However, there is no equivalence checking method reported in the literature for PRES+ models to the best of our knowledge. In contrast, equivalence checking of FSMD models exist. As a first step, therefore, we seek to devise an algorithm to translate PRES+ models to FSMD models. "
"Black hole is called optimal if information content is minimal at the University region, consisting of usual substance and one(n) black hole(s). Optimal black hole mass does not depend on the mass of the Universe region. Optimal black holes can exist when at least the two types of substance are available in the Universe: with non-linear and linear correspondence between information content and mass. Information content of optimal black hole is proportional to squared coefficient correlating information content with mass in usual substance and in inverse proportion to coefficient correlating information content with black hole mass. Concentration of mass in optimal black hole minimizes information content in the system ""usual substance - black holes"". Minimal information content of the Universe consisting of optimal black holes only is twice as less as information content available of the Universe of the same mass filled with usual substance only. Under the radiation temperature T \approx 1E + 12 K the mass of optimal black holes that emerged in the systems ""radiation - black hole"" is equal to the mass of optimal black holes that emerged in the systems ""hydrogen (protons) - black hole"".

"Predicting the turnover of a company in the ever fluctuating Stock market has always proved to be a precarious situation and most certainly a difficult task in hand. Data mining is a well-known sphere of Computer Science that aims on extracting meaningful information from large databases. However, despite the existence of many algorithms for the purpose of predicting the future trends, their efficiency is questionable as their predictions suffer from a high error rate. The objective of this paper is to investigate various classification algorithms to predict the turnover of different companies based on the Stock price. The authorized dataset for predicting the turnover was taken from www.bsc.com and included the stock market values of various companies over the past 10 years. The algorithms were investigated using the ""R"" tool. The feature selection algorithm, Boruta, was run on this dataset to extract the important and influential features for classification. With these extracted features, the Total Turnover of the company was predicted using various classification algorithms like Random Forest, Decision Tree, SVM and Multinomial Regression. This prediction mechanism was implemented to predict the turnover of a company on an everyday basis and hence could help navigate through dubious stock market trades. An accuracy rate of 95% was achieved by the above prediction process. Moreover, the importance of stock market attributes was established as well. "
"Centers of categories capture the natural operations on their objects. Homotopy coherent centers are introduced here as an extension of this notion to categories with an associated homotopy theory. These centers can also be interpreted as Hochschild cohomology type invariants in contexts that are not necessarily linear or stable, and we argue that they are more appropriate to higher categorical contexts than the centers of their homotopy or derived categories. Among many other things, we present an obstruction theory for realizing elements in the centers of homotopy categories, and a Bousfield-Kan type spectral sequence that computes the homotopy groups. Nontrivial classes of examples are given as illustration throughout. "
"The energy variance extrapolation method consists in relating the approximate energies in many-body calculations to the corresponding energy variances and inferring eigenvalues by extrapolating to zero variance. The method needs a fast evaluation of the energy variances. For many-body methods that expand the nuclear wave functions in terms of deformed Slater determinants, the best available method for the evaluation of energy variances scales with the sixth power of the number of single-particle states. We propose a new method which depends on the number of single-particle orbits and the number of particles rather than the number of single-particle states. We discuss as an example the case of ${}^4He$ using the chiral N3LO interaction in a basis consisting up to 184 single-particle states. "
"Many computer vision problems can be posed as learning a low-dimensional subspace from high dimensional data. The low rank matrix factorization (LRMF) represents a commonly utilized subspace learning strategy. Most of the current LRMF techniques are constructed on the optimization problems using L1-norm and L2-norm losses, which mainly deal with Laplacian and Gaussian noises, respectively. To make LRMF capable of adapting more complex noise, this paper proposes a new LRMF model by assuming noise as Mixture of Exponential Power (MoEP) distributions and proposes a penalized MoEP (PMoEP) model by combining the penalized likelihood method with MoEP distributions. Such setting facilitates the learned LRMF model capable of automatically fitting the real noise through MoEP distributions. Each component in this mixture is adapted from a series of preliminary super- or sub-Gaussian candidates. Moreover, by facilitating the local continuity of noise components, we embed Markov random field into the PMoEP model and further propose the advanced PMoEP-MRF model. An Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm and a variational EM (VEM) algorithm are also designed to infer the parameters involved in the proposed PMoEP and the PMoEP-MRF model, respectively. The superseniority of our methods is demonstrated by extensive experiments on synthetic data, face modeling, hyperspectral image restoration and background subtraction. "
The effective mass of phi meson at non-zero temperature is re-examined with an effective chiral Lagrangian. We find that the phi mass decreases with temperature but the effect is small compared to the result obtained from calculations using QCD sum rules. The leading contributions come from kaon loop corrections but vector meson contributions are also important as temperature increases. We discuss consequences of these changes to the phenomena of chiral phase transition in hot hadronic matter.
"In many superconducting devices, including qubits, quasiparticle excitations are detrimental. A normal metal ($N$) in contact with a superconductor ($S$) can trap these excitations; therefore such a trap can potentially improve the devices performances. The two materials influence each other, a phenomenon known as proximity effect which has drawn attention since the '60s. Here we study whether this mutual influence places a limitation on the possible performance improvement in superconducting qubits. We first revisit the proximity effect in uniform $NS$ bilayers; despite the long history of this problem, we present novel findings for the density of states. We then extend our results to describe a non-uniform system in the vicinity of a trap edge. Using these results together with a phenomenological model for the suppression of the quasiparticle density due to the trap, we find in a transmon qubit an optimum trap-junction distance at which the qubit relaxation rate is minimized. This optimum distance, of the order of 4 to 20 coherence lengths, originates from the competition between proximity effect and quasiparticle density suppression. We conclude that the harmful influence of the proximity effect can be avoided so long as the trap is farther away from the junction than this optimum. "
This article explores the influence of evenly spaced data points on radial-basis-function interpolation.
"A Lie 2-group $G$ is a category internal to the category of Lie groups. Consequently it is a monoidal category and a Lie groupoid. The Lie groupoid structure on $G$ gives rise to the Lie 2-algebra $\mathbb{X}(G)$ of multiplicative vector fields, see (Berwick-Evans -- Lerman). The monoidal structure on $G$ gives rise to a left action of the 2-group $G$ on the Lie groupoid $G$, hence to an action of $G$ on the Lie 2-algebra $\mathbb{X}(G)$. As a result we get the Lie 2-algebra $\mathbb{X}(G)^G$ of left-invariant multiplicative vector fields. On the other hand there is a well-known construction that associates a Lie 2-algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ to a Lie 2-group $G$: apply the functor $\mathsf{Lie}: \mathsf{Lie Groups} \to \mathsf{Lie Algebras}$ to the structure maps of the category $G$. We show that the Lie 2-algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ is isomorphic to the Lie 2-algebra $\mathbb{X}(G)^G$ of left invariant multiplicative vector fields. "
"We present a novel formulation of the multiple object tracking problem which integrates low and mid-level features. In particular, we formulate the tracking problem as a quadratic program coupling detections and dense point trajectories. Due to the computational complexity of the initial QP, we propose an approximation by two auxiliary problems, a temporal and spatial association, where the temporal subproblem can be efficiently solved by a linear program and the spatial association by a clustering algorithm. The objective function of the QP is used in order to find the optimal number of clusters, where each cluster ideally represents one person. Evaluation is provided for multiple scenarios, showing the superiority of our method with respect to classic tracking-by-detection methods and also other methods that greedily integrate low-level features. "
"Statistical machine learning methods are increasingly used for neuroimaging data analysis. Their main virtue is their ability to model high-dimensional datasets, e.g. multivariate analysis of activation images or resting-state time series. Supervised learning is typically used in decoding or encoding settings to relate brain images to behavioral or clinical observations, while unsupervised learning can uncover hidden structures in sets of images (e.g. resting state functional MRI) or find sub-populations in large cohorts. By considering different functional neuroimaging applications, we illustrate how scikit-learn, a Python machine learning library, can be used to perform some key analysis steps. Scikit-learn contains a very large set of statistical learning algorithms, both supervised and unsupervised, and its application to neuroimaging data provides a versatile tool to study the brain. "
"Vertex deletion problems ask whether it is possible to delete at most $k$ vertices from a graph so that the resulting graph belongs to a specified graph class. Over the past years, the parameterized complexity of vertex deletion to a plethora of graph classes has been systematically researched. Here we present the first single-exponential fixed-parameter tractable algorithm for vertex deletion to distance-hereditary graphs, a well-studied graph class which is particularly important in the context of vertex deletion due to its connection to the graph parameter rank-width. We complement our result with matching asymptotic lower bounds based on the exponential time hypothesis. As an application of our algorithm, we show that a vertex deletion set to distance-hereditary graphs can be used as a parameter which allows single-exponential fixed-parameter tractable algorithms for classical NP-hard problems. "
"To understand the effect of molecular environment on the electronic and magnetic properties of the single-molecule magnet (SMM) Mn$_{12}$, we explore two possible means for adding extra electrons to molecule. We explore both substitution of Mn ions by Fe ions and the inclusion of neighboring electronic donors. For both possibilities we calculate, within density-functional theory, the electronic structure, the total ground-state spin and ordering, the magnetic anisotropy barrier, the transverse magnetic anisotropy parameter $E$ which is responsible for some measured tunneling, and the tilting angle of the easy axis from the z axis. Our calculations show that the total spin increases with increasing number of extra electrons except for the case of Mn$_{8}$Fe$_4$ where the resulting ground state has a low spin. The calculated energy gaps between the unoccupied and the occupied orbitals exhibit no clear trend as a function of number of extra electrons. The calculated magnetic anisotropy barrier decreases with increasing number of extra electrons and can be directly chased to a quenching of Jahn-Teller distortions at the sites where the additional electrons are localized. The values of $E$ and the easy-axis tilting angles for the geometries with one- and two-extra electrons are significantly larger than those induced by solvent disorder. "
"We characterize the 795 nm $^3$H$_6$ to $^3$H$_4$ transition of Tm$^{3+}$ in a Ti$^{4+}$:LiNbO$_{3}$ waveguide at temperatures as low as 800 mK. Coherence and hyperfine population lifetimes -- up to 117 $\mu$s and 2.5 hours, respectively -- exceed those at 3 K at least ten-fold, and are equivalent to those observed in a bulk Tm$^{3+}$:LiNbO$_{3}$ crystal under similar conditions. We also find a transition dipole moment that is equivalent to that of the bulk. Finally, we prepare a 0.5 GHz-bandwidth atomic frequency comb of finesse $>$2 on a vanishing background. These results demonstrate the suitability of rare-earth-doped waveguides created using industry-standard Ti-indiffusion in LiNbO$_3$ for on-chip quantum applications. "
"We consider the derived category of coherent sheaves on a complex vector space equivariant with respect to an action of a finite reflection group G. In some cases, including Weyl groups of type A, B, G_2, F_4, as well as the groups G(m,1,n), we construct a semiorthogonal decomposition of this category, indexed by the conjugacy classes of G. The pieces of this decompositions are equivalent to the derived categories of coherent sheaves on the quotient-spaces V^g/C(g), where C(g) is the centralizer subgroup of g in G. In the case of the Weyl groups the construction uses some key results about the Springer correspondence, due to Lusztig, along with some formality statement generalizing a result of Deligne. We also construct global analogs of some of these semiorthogonal decompositions involving derived categories of equivariant coherent sheaves on C^n, where C is a smooth curve. "
"Social identities are among the key factors driving behavior in complex societies. Signals of social identity are known to influence individual behaviors in the adoption of innovations. Yet the population-level consequences of identity signaling on the diffusion of innovations are largely unknown. Here we use both analytical and agent-based modeling to consider the spread of a beneficial innovation in a structured population in which there exist two groups who are averse to being mistaken for each other. We investigate the dynamics of adoption and consider the role of structural factors such as demographic skew and communication scale on population-level outcomes. We find that outgroup aversion can lead to adoption being delayed or suppressed in one group, and that population-wide underadoption is common. Comparing the two models, we find that differential adoption can arise due to structural constraints on information flow even in the absence of intrinsic between-group differences in adoption rates. Further, we find that patterns of polarization in adoption at both local and global scales depend on the details of demographic organization and the scale of communication. This research has particular relevance to widely beneficial but identity-relevant products and behaviors, such as green technologies, where overall levels of adoption determine the positive benefits that accrue to society at large. "
"We consider the problem of approximately reconstructing a partially-observed, approximately low-rank matrix. This problem has received much attention lately, mostly using the trace-norm as a surrogate to the rank. Here we study low-rank matrix reconstruction using both the trace-norm, as well as the less-studied max-norm, and present reconstruction guarantees based on existing analysis on the Rademacher complexity of the unit balls of these norms. We show how these are superior in several ways to recently published guarantees based on specialized analysis. "
"It has been known that some solar activity indicators show a double-peak feature in their evolution through a solar cycle, which is not conspicuous in sunspot number. In this letter, we investigate the high solar dynamic activity in the declining phase of the sunspot cycle by examining the evolution of polar and low latitude coronal hole areas and the statistics of splitting and merging events of coronal holes and coronal mass ejections detected by SOHO/LASCO C3 in solar cycle 23. Although the total coronal hole area is at its maximum near the sunspot minimum, in which polar coronal holes prevail, it shows a comparable second maximum in the declining phase of the cycle, in which low latitude coronal holes are dominant. The events of coronal hole splitting or merging, which are attributed to surface motions of magnetic fluxes, are also mostly populated in the declining phase of the cycle. The far-reaching C3 coronal mass ejections are also over-populated in the declining phase of the cycle. From these results we suggest that solar dynamic activities due to the horizontal motions of magnetic fluxes extend far in the declining phase of the sunspot cycle. "
"Hexagonal RMnO3 is a multiferroic compound with a giant spin-lattice coupling at an antiferromagnetic transition temperature [1]. Despite extensive studies over the past two decades, however, the origin and underlying microscopic mechanism of the strong spin-lattice coupling remain still very much elusive. In this study, we have tried to address this problem by measuring the thermal expansion and dielectric constant of doped single crystals Y1-xLuxMnO3 with x = 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, and 1.0. From these measurements, we confirm that there is a progressive change in the physical properties with doping. At the same time, all our samples exhibit clear anomalies at TN, even in the samples with x = 0.5 and 0.75 as opposed to some earlier ideas, which suggests an unusual doping dependence of the anomaly. Our work reveals yet another interesting facet of the spin lattice coupling issue in hexagonal RMnO3. "
"Here, we present 6-9 um spectra of a sample of RNe, HII regions, YSOs, evolved stars and galaxies that show strong unidentified infrared bands, obtained with the ISO-SWS. The IR emission features show pronounced variations. 1) The 6.2 um feature shifts and clearly shows profile variations. 2) The 7.7 um complex is comprised of at least two subpeaks peaking at 7.6 and one longwards of 7.7 um. In some cases the main peak can apparently shift up to 8 um. Two sources do not exhibit a 7.7 um complex but instead show a broad emission feature at 8.22 um. 3) The 8.6 um feature has a symmetric profile in all sources and some sources exhibit this band at slightly longer wavelengths. For the 6.2, 7.7 and 8.6 um features, the sources have been classified independently based on their profile and peak position. The classes derived for these features are directly linked with each other. Furthermore, the observed 6--9 um spectrum depends on the type of object. We attribute the observed 6.2 um profile and peak position to the combined effect of a PAH family and anharmonicity with pure PAHs representing the 6.3 um component and substituted/complexed PAHs representing the 6.2 um component. The 7.6 um component is well reproduced by both pure and substituted/complexed PAHs but the 7.8 um component remains an enigma. In addition, the exact identification of the 8.22 um feature remains unknown. The observed variations in the characteristics of the IR emission bands are linked to the local physical conditions. Possible formation and evolution processes that may influence the interstellar PAH class are highlighted. "
"We present a systematic investigation of two-photon excitation processes in a GaAs-based microcavity in the strong-coupling regime. We observe second harmonic generation resonant to the upper and lower polariton level, which exhibits a strong dependence on the photonic fraction of the corresponding polariton. In addition we have performed two-photon excitation spectroscopy to identify $2p$ exciton states which are crucial for the operation as a terahertz lasing device, which was suggested recently [A. V. Kavokin et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{108}, 197401 (2012)]. However, no distinct signatures of a $2p$ exciton state could be identified, which indicates a low two-photon pumping efficiency. "
"The aim of this paper is to introduce a new design of experiment method for A/B tests in order to balance the covariate information in all treatment groups. A/B tests (or ""A/B/n tests"") refer to the experiments and the corresponding inference on the treatment effect(s) of a two-level or multi-level controllable experimental factor. The common practice is to use a randomized design and perform hypothesis tests on the estimates. However, such estimation and inference are not always accurate when covariate imbalance exists among the treatment groups. To overcome this issue, we propose a discrepancy-based criterion and show that the design minimizing this criterion significantly improves the accuracy of the treatment effect(s) estimates. The discrepancy-based criterion is model-free and thus makes the estimation of the treatment effect(s) robust to the model assumptions. More importantly, the proposed design is applicable to both continuous and categorical response measurements. We develop two efficient algorithms to construct the designs by optimizing the criterion for both offline and online A/B tests. Through simulation study and a real example, we show that the proposed design approach achieves good covariate balance and accurate estimation. "
"N. Hamilton and J. A. Thas describe a link between maximal arcs of Mathon type and partial flocks of the quadratic cone. This link is of a rather algebraic nature. In this paper we establish a geometric connection between these two structures. We also define a composition on the flock planes and use this to work out an analogue of the synthetic version of Mathon's Theorem. Finally, we show how it is possible to construct a maximal arc of Mathon type of degree 2d, containing a Denniston arc of degree d provided that there is a solution to a certain given system of trace conditions. "
"We present the theory of dielectric spectra allowing for homogeneous and inhomogeneous broadening mechanisms contributions. The dielectric absorption line shape for oscillators with memory and Debye type relaxors with distribution of, respectively, resonant frequencies and relaxation times (due to random electric fields distribution) has been calculated. The conditions of hole burning observation are discussed. It is shown that the investigations of the inhomogeneously broadened line shape and width as well as hole burning can give valuable information about the distribution of random fields and relaxation times. The latter seems to be extremely important for the disordered systems like supercooled liquids and relaxor ferroelectrics. "
"We present an interaction scheme that exhibits a dynamical consequence of virtual photons carried by a vacuum-field dressed two-level atom in the ultrastrong coupling regime. We show that, with the aid of an external driving field, virtual photons provide a transition matrix element that enables the atom to evolve coherently and reversibly to an auxiliary level accompanied by the emission of a real photon. The process corresponds to a type of vacuum Rabi oscillation, and we show that the effective vacuum Rabi frequency is proportional to the amplitude of a single virtual photon in the ground state. Therefore the interaction scheme could serve as a probe of ground state structures in the ultrastrong coupling regime. "
"The analysis of adverse events (AEs) is a key component in the assessment of a drug's safety profile. Inappropriate analysis methods may result in misleading conclusions about a therapy's safety and consequently its benefit-risk ratio. The statistical analysis of AEs is complicated by the fact that the follow-up times can vary between the patients included in a clinical trial. This paper takes as its focus the analysis of AE data in the presence of varying follow-up times within the benefit assessment of therapeutic interventions. Instead of approaching this issue directly and solely from an analysis point of view, we first discuss what should be estimated in the context of safety data, leading to the concept of estimands. Although the current discussion on estimands is mainly related to efficacy evaluation, the concept is applicable to safety endpoints as well. Within the framework of estimands, we present statistical methods for analysing AEs with the focus being on the time to the occurrence of the first AE of a specific type. We give recommendations which estimators should be used for the estimands described. Furthermore, we state practical implications of the analysis of AEs in clinical trials and give an overview of examples across different indications. We also provide a review of current practices of health technology assessment (HTA) agencies with respect to the evaluation of safety data. Finally, we describe problems with meta-analyses of AE data and sketch possible solutions. "
"In a simplified renormalizable model where the neutrinos have PMNS (Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata) mixings tan$^{2} \theta_{12} = {1/2}, \theta_{13}=0, \theta_{23} = \pi/4$ and with flavor symmetry $T^{'}$ there is a corresponding prediction where the quarks have CKM (Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa) mixings tan$2 \Theta_{12} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{3}, \Theta_{13}=0, \Theta_{23} =0$.

"A new and automated method is presented for the analysis of high-resolution absorption spectra. Three established numerical methods are unified into one ""artificial intelligence"" process: a genetic algorithm (GVPFIT); non-linear least-squares with parameter constraints (VPFIT); and Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA). The method has broad application but here we apply it specifically to the problem of measuring the fine structure constant at high redshift. For this we need objectivity and reproducibility. GVPFIT is also motivated by the importance of obtaining a large statistical sample of measurements of $\Delta\alpha/\alpha$. Interactive analyses are both time consuming and complex and automation makes obtaining a large sample feasible. In contrast to previous methodologies, we use BMA to derive results using a large set of models and show that this procedure is more robust than a human picking a single preferred model since BMA avoids the systematic uncertainties associated with model choice. Numerical simulations provide stringent tests of the whole process and we show using both real and simulated spectra that the unified automated fitting procedure out-performs a human interactive analysis. The method should be invaluable in the context of future instrumentation like ESPRESSO on the VLT and indeed future ELTs. We apply the method to the $z_{abs} = 1.8389$ absorber towards the $z_{em} = 2.145$ quasar J110325-264515. The derived constraint of $\Delta\alpha/\alpha = 3.3 \pm 2.9 \times 10^{-6}$ is consistent with no variation and also consistent with the tentative spatial variation reported in Webb et al (2011) and King et al (2012).

"Suppose the signal x is realized by driving a k-sparse signal u through an arbitrary unknown stable discrete-linear time invariant system H. These types of processes arise naturally in Reflection Seismology. In this paper we are interested in several problems: (a) Blind-Deconvolution: Can we recover both the filter $H$ and the sparse signal $u$ from noisy measurements? (b) Compressive Sensing: Is x compressible in the conventional sense of compressed sensing? Namely, can x, u and H be reconstructed from a sparse set of measurements. We develop novel L1 minimization methods to solve both cases and establish sufficient conditions for exact recovery for the case when the unknown system H is auto-regressive (i.e. all pole) of a known order. In the compressed sensing/sampling setting it turns out that both H and x can be reconstructed from O(k log(n)) measurements under certain technical conditions on the support structure of u. Our main idea is to pass x through a linear time invariant system G and collect O(k log(n)) sequential measurements. The filter G is chosen suitably, namely, its associated Toeplitz matrix satisfies the RIP property. We develop a novel LP optimization algorithm and show that both the unknown filter H and the sparse input u can be reliably estimated. "
"The R\'enyi-Shannon entropy associated to critical quantum spins chain with central charge $c=1$ is shown to have a phase transition at some value $n_c$ of the R\'enyi parameter $n$ which depends on the Luttinger parameter (or compactification radius R). Using a new replica-free formulation, the entropy is expressed as a combination of single-sheet partition functions evaluated at $n-$ dependent values of the stiffness. The transition occurs when a vertex operator becomes relevant at the boundary. Our numerical results (exact diagonalizations for the XXZ and $J_1-J_2$ models) are in agreement with the analytical predictions: above $n_c=4/R^2$ the subleading and universal contribution to the entropy is $\ln(L)(R^2-1)/(4n-4)$ for open chains, and $\ln(R)/(1-n)$ for periodic ones (R=1 at the free fermion point). The replica approach used in previous works fails to predict this transition and turns out to be correct only for $n<n_c$. From the point of view of two-dimensional Rokhsar-Kivelson states, the transition reveals a rich structure in the entanglement spectra. "
"The Aharonov-Bohm and superradiant effect on the redaitive decay rate of an exciton in a quantum ring is studied. With the increasing of ring radius, the exciton decay rate is enhanced by superradiance, while the amplitude of AB oscillation is decreased. The competition between these two effects is shown explicitly and may be observable in time-resolved exeriments. "
"Conformally-invariant curves that appear at critical points in two-dimensional statistical mechanics systems, and their fractal geometry have received a lot of attention in recent years. On the one hand, Schramm has invented a new rigorous as well as practical calculational approach to critical curves, based on a beautiful unification of conformal maps and stochastic processes, and by now known as Schramm-Loewner evolution (SLE). On the other hand, Duplantier has applied boundary quantum gravity methods to calculate exact multifractal exponents associated with critical curves. In the first part of this paper I provide a pedagogical introduction to SLE. I present mathematical facts from the theory of conformal maps and stochastic processes related to SLE. Then I review basic properties of SLE and provide practical derivation of various interesting quantities related to critical curves, including fractal dimensions and crossing probabilities. The second part of the paper is devoted to a way of describing critical curves using boundary conformal field theory (CFT) in the so-called Coulomb gas formalism. This description provides an alternative (to quantum gravity) way of obtaining the multifractal spectrum of critical curves using only traditional methods of CFT based on free bosonic fields. "
"Complex light metal hydrides possess many properties which make them attractive as a storage medium for hydrogen, but typically, catalysts are required to lower the hydrogen desorption temperature and to facilitate hydrogen uptake in the form of a reversible reaction. The overwhelming focus in the search for catalysing agents has been on compounds containing titanium, but the precise mechanism of their actions remains somewhat obscure. A recent experiment has now shown that fullerenes (C$_{60}$) can also act as catalyst for both hydrogen uptake and release in lithium borohydride (LiBH$_4$). In an effort to understand the involved mechanism, we have employed density functional theory to carry out a detailed study of the interaction between this complex metal hydride and the carbon nanomaterial. Considering a stepwise reduction of the hydrogen content in LiBH$_4$, we find that the presence of C$_{60}$ can lead to a substantial reduction of the involved H-removal energies. This effect is explained as a consequence of the interaction between the BH$_x^-$ complex and the C$_{60}$ entity. "
"The blends and hybrid nanocomposites of polypropylene - cycloolefin copolymer were prepared by a twin-screw extruder followed by microfibril formation using a single screw extruder. The effects of shear rate and organoclay on the morphology of polypropylene - cycloolefin copolymer (PP/COC - 80/20 wt. %) blends were studied by using a combination of rheological measurements, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). It was found that although the viscosity ratio of PP/COC blend was unfavorable for COC droplet deformation, the COC phase was converted to finely dispersed fibrils in PP matrix. This could be asserted to the high elasticity of the COC droplets that suppressed the droplet breakup in the favor of fibrillation process. The high glass transition temperature of COC (140 degree centigrade) could also assist restoring the generated microfibril morphology upon cooling. The experimental results also depicted that the droplet deformation and microfibril formation of PP/COC/organoclay nanocomposites mainly depend on the organoclay partitioning, which could be controlled predominantly by kinetic parameters. While the localization of organoclay in the PP matrix resulted in smaller COC droplets and fibrils with smaller diameter, the presence of organoclay inside COC droplets reduced the droplet deformability, leading to fibrils with larger diameter. "
"Levi subgroup actions on Schubert varieties are studied. In the case of partial flag varieties, the horospherical actions are determined. This leads to a characterization of the toroidal and horospherical partial flag varieties with Picard number 1. In the more general case, we provide a set of necessary conditions for the action of a Levi subgroup on a Schubert variety to be toroidal. The singular locus of a (co)minuscule Schubert variety is shown to contain all the $L_{max}$-stable Schubert subvarieties, where $L_{max}$ is the standard Levi subgroup of the maximal parabolic which acts on the Schubert variety by left multiplication. In type A, the effect of the Billey-Postnikov decomposition on toroidal Schubert varieties is obtained. "
"We revisit the physics of electron gas bilayers in the quantum Hall regime [Nature, 432 (2004) 691; Science, 305 (2004) 950], where transport and tunneling measurements provided evidence of a superfluid phase being present in the system. Previously, this behavior was explained by the possible formation of a BEC of excitons in the half-filled electron bilayers, where empty states play the role of holes. We discuss the fundamental difficulties with this scenario, and propose an alternative approach based on a treatment of the system as a pseudospin magnet. We show that the experimentally observed tunneling peak can be linked to the XY ferromagnet (FM) to Ising antiferromagnet (AFM) phase transition of the S=1/2 XXZ pseudospin model, driven by the change in total electron density. This transition is accompanied by a qualitative change in the nature of the low energy spin wave dispersion from a gapless linear mode in the XY-FM phase to a gapped, quadratic mode in the Ising-AFM phase. "
"The values of renormalized Polyakov loops in the three lowest representations of SU(3) were measured numerically on the lattice. We find that in magnitude, condensates respect the large-N property of factorization. In several ways, the deconfining phase transition for N=3 appears to be like that in the N=infinity matrix model of Gross and Witten. Surprisingly, we find that the values of the renormalized triplet loop are described by an SU(3) matrix model, with an effective action dominated by the triplet loop. Future numerical simulations with a larger number of colors should be able to show whether or not the deconfining phase transition is close to the Gross-Witten point. "
"We present a suite of 34 high-resolution cosmological zoom-in simulations consisting of thousands of halos up to M_halo~10^12 M_sun (M_star~10^10.5 M_sun) at z>=5 from the Feedback in Realistic Environments project. We post-process our simulations with a three-dimensional Monte Carlo dust radiative transfer code to study dust extinction, dust emission, and dust temperature within these simulated z>=5 galaxies. Our sample forms a tight correlation between infrared excess (IRX=F_IR/F_UV) and ultraviolet (UV)-continuum slope (beta_UV), despite the patchy, clumpy dust geometry shown in our simulations. We find that the IRX-beta_UV relation is mainly determined by the shape of the extinction curve and is independent of its normalization (set by the dust-to-gas ratio). The bolometric IR luminosity (L_IR) correlates with the intrinsic UV luminosity and the star formation rate (SFR) averaged over the past 10 Myr. We predict that at a given L_IR, the peak wavelength of the dust spectral energy distributions for z>=5 galaxies is smaller by a factor of 2 (due to higher dust temperatures on average) than at z=0. The higher dust temperatures are driven by higher specific SFRs and SFR surface densities with increasing redshift. We derive the galaxy UV luminosity functions (LFs) at z=5-10 from our simulations and confirm that a heavy attenuation is required to reproduce the observed bright-end UVLFs. We also predict the IRLFs and UV luminosity densities at z=5-10. We discuss the implications of our results on current and future observations probing dust attenuation and emission in z>=5 galaxies.

"Thanks to the growing availability of spoofing databases and rapid advances in using them, systems for detecting voice spoofing attacks are becoming more and more capable, and error rates close to zero are being reached for the ASVspoof2015 database. However, speech synthesis and voice conversion paradigms that are not considered in the ASVspoof2015 database are appearing. Such examples include direct waveform modelling and generative adversarial networks. We also need to investigate the feasibility of training spoofing systems using only low-quality found data. For that purpose, we developed a generative adversarial network-based speech enhancement system that improves the quality of speech data found in publicly available sources. Using the enhanced data, we trained state-of-the-art text-to-speech and voice conversion models and evaluated them in terms of perceptual speech quality and speaker similarity. The results show that the enhancement models significantly improved the SNR of low-quality degraded data found in publicly available sources and that they significantly improved the perceptual cleanliness of the source speech without significantly degrading the naturalness of the voice. However, the results also show limitations when generating speech with the low-quality found data. "
"We address the question of whether or not assembly bias arises in the absence of highly non-linear effects such as tidal stripping of halos near larger mass concentrations. Therefore, we use a simplified dynamical scheme where these effects are not modeled. We choose the punctuated Zel'dovich (PZ) approximation, which prevents orbit mixing by coalescing particles coming within a critical distance of each other. A numerical implementation of this approximation is fast, allowing us to run a large number of simulations to study assembly bias. We measure an assembly bias from 60 PZ simulations, each with 512^3 cold particles in a 128h^-1 Mpc cubic box. The assembly bias estimated from the correlation functions at separations < 5h^-1 Mpc for objects (halos) at z=0 is comparable to that obtained in full N-body simulations. For masses 4x10^11 h^-1 Mo the ""oldest"" 10% haloes are 3-5 times more correlated than the ""youngest"" 10%. The bias weakens with increasing mass, also in agreement with full N-body simulations. We find that that halo ages are correlated with the dimensionality of the surrounding linear structures as measured by the parameter (\lambda_1+\lambda_2+\lambda_3)/ (\lambda_1^2+\lambda_2^2+\lambda_3^2)^{1/2} where \lambda_i are proportional to the eigenvalues of the velocity deformation tensor. Our results suggest that assembly bias may already be encoded in the early stages of the evolution. "
"Transforming a graphical user interface screenshot created by a designer into computer code is a typical task conducted by a developer in order to build customized software, websites, and mobile applications. In this paper, we show that deep learning methods can be leveraged to train a model end-to-end to automatically generate code from a single input image with over 77% of accuracy for three different platforms (i.e. iOS, Android and web-based technologies). "
In this work we tried to prove the lonely runner conjecture also known as the view obstruction problem.
"Qutrits (i.e., three-level quantum systems) can be used to achieve many quantum information and communication tasks due to their large Hilbert spaces. In this work, we propose a scheme to transfer an unknown quantum state between two flux qutrits coupled to two superconducting coplanar waveguide resonators. The quantum state transfer can be deterministically achieved without measurements. Because resonator photons are virtually excited during the operation time, the decoherences caused by the resonator decay and the unwanted inter-resonator crosstalk are greatly suppressed. Moreover, our approach can be adapted to other solid-state qutrits coupled to circuit resonators. Numerical simulations show that the high-fidelity transfer of quantum state between the two qutrits is feasible with current circuit QED technology. "
"Quantum entanglement is the central resource behind applications in quantum information science, from quantum computers and simulators of complex quantum systems to metrology and secure communication. All of these applications require the quantum control of large networks of quantum bits (qubits) to realize gains and speedups over conventional devices. However, propagating quantum entanglement generally becomes difficult or impossible as the system grows in size, owing to the inevitable decoherence from the complexity of connections between the qubits and increased couplings to the environment. Here, we demonstrate the first step in a modular approach to scaling entanglement by utilizing a hierarchy of quantum buses on a collection of three atomic ion qubits stored in two remote ion trap modules. Entanglement within a module is achieved with deterministic near-field interactions through phonons, and remote entanglement between modules is achieved through a probabilistic interaction through photons. This minimal system allows us to address generic issues in synchronization and scalability of entanglement with multiple buses, while pointing the way toward a modular large-scale quantum computer architecture that promises less spectral crowding and less decoherence. We generate this modular entanglement faster than the observed qubit decoherence rate, thus the system can be scaled to much larger dimensions by adding more modules. "
"Object detection is a fundamental problem in image understanding. One popular solution is the R-CNN framework and its fast versions. They decompose the object detection problem into two cascaded easier tasks: 1) generating object proposals from images, 2) classifying proposals into various object categories. Despite that we are handling with two relatively easier tasks, they are not solved perfectly and there's still room for improvement. In this paper, we push the ""divide and conquer"" solution even further by dividing each task into two sub-tasks. We call the proposed method ""CRAFT"" (Cascade Region-proposal-network And FasT-rcnn), which tackles each task with a carefully designed network cascade. We show that the cascade structure helps in both tasks: in proposal generation, it provides more compact and better localized object proposals; in object classification, it reduces false positives (mainly between ambiguous categories) by capturing both inter- and intra-category variances. CRAFT achieves consistent and considerable improvement over the state-of-the-art on object detection benchmarks like PASCAL VOC 07/12 and ILSVRC. "
We introduce the concept of Berry's phase in Josephson junctions and consider how this geometric phase arises due to applied oscillating electric fields and affects Cooper-pair tunneling across the Josephson junction barrier. A finite Berry's phase can be detected by its renormalization of the electric field amplitude. This has implications for the designing of accurate Josephson junction microwave detectors.
"Let $C_\Gamma$ be the Cauchy integral operator on a Lipschitz curve $\Gamma$. In this article, the authors show that the commutator $[b,C_\Gamma]$ is bounded (resp., compact) on the Morrey space $L^{p,\,\lambda}(\mathbb R)$ for any (or some) $p\in(1, \infty)$ and $\lambda\in(0, 1)$ if and only if $b\in {\rm BMO}(\mathbb R)$ (resp., ${\rm CMO}(\mathbb R)$). As an application, a factorization of the classical Hardy space $H^1(\mathbb R)$ in terms of $C_\Gamma$ and its adjoint operator is obtained. "
"Line of Sight (LoS) networks were designed to model wireless communication in settings which may contain obstacles restricting node visibility. For fixed positive integer $d$, and positive integer $\omega$, a graph $G=(V,E)$ is a ($d$-dimensional) LoS network with range parameter $\omega$ if it can be embedded in a cube of side size $n$ of the $d$-dimensional integer grid so that each pair of vertices in $V$ are adjacent if and only if their embedding coordinates differ only in one position and such difference is less than $\omega$. In this paper we investigate a dynamic programming (DP) approach which can be used to obtain efficient algorithmic solutions for various combinatorial problems in LoS networks. In particular DP solves the Maximum Independent Set (MIS) problem in LoS networks optimally for any $\omega$ on {\em narrow} LoS networks (i.e. networks which can be embedded in a $n \times k \times k \ldots \times k$ region, for some fixed $k$ independent of $n$). In the unrestricted case it has been shown that the MIS problem is NP-hard when $ \omega > 2$ (the hardness proof goes through for any $\omega=O(n^{1-\delta})$, for fixed $0<\delta<1$). We describe how DP can be used as a building block in the design of good approximation algorithms. In particular we present a 2-approximation algorithm and a fast polynomial time approximation scheme for the MIS problem in arbitrary $d$-dimensional LoS networks. Finally we comment on how the approach can be adapted to solve a number of important optimization problems in LoS networks. "
"The HST Frontier Fields cluster MACS J1149.6+2223 is one of the most complex merging clusters, believed to consist of four dark matter halos. We present results from deep (365 ks) Chandra observations of the cluster, which reveal the most distant cold front (z=0.544) discovered to date. In the cluster outskirts, we also detect hints of a surface brightness edge that could be the bow shock preceding the cold front. The substructure analysis of the cluster identified several components with large relative radial velocities, thus indicating that at least some collisions occur almost along the line of sight. The inclination of the mergers with respect to the plane of the sky poses significant observational challenges at X-ray wavelengths. MACS J1149.6+2223 possibly hosts a steep-spectrum radio halo. If the steepness of the radio halo is confirmed, then the radio spectrum, combined with the relatively regular ICM morphology, could indicate that MACS J1149.6+2223 is an old merging cluster. "
"We show the existence of stable two- and three-dimensional vortex solitons carrying multiple, spatially separated, single-charge topological dislocations nested around a vortex-ring core. Such new nonlinear states are supported by elliptical gain landscapes in focusing nonlinear media with two-photon absorption. The separation between the phase dislocations is dictated mostly by the geometry of gain landscape and it only slightly changes upon variation of the gain or absorption strength. "
"We experimentally and numerically study the atomic response and pulse propagation effects of high-order harmonics generated in Xe, Kr, and Ar driven by a 2.1-\mu m infrared femtosecond light source. The light source is an optical parametric chirped-pulse amplifier, and a modified strong-field approximation and 3-dimensional pulse propagation code are used for the numerical simulations. The extended cutoff in the long-wavelength driven high-harmonic generation has revealed the spectral shaping of high-order harmonics due to the atomic structure (or photo-recombination cross-section) and the macroscopic effects, which are the main factors of determining the conversion efficiency besides the driving wavelength. Using precise numerical simulations to determine the macroscopic electron wavepacket, we are able to extract the photo-recombination cross-sections from experimental high-order harmonic spectra in the presence of macroscopic effects. We have experimentally observed that the macroscopic effects shift the observed Cooper minimum of Kr from 80 eV to 60-70 eV and wash out the Cooper minimum of Ar. Measured high-harmonic conversion efficiencies per harmonic near the cutoff are ~10^{-9} for all three gases. "
"Let $(R,\m)$ be a Noetherian local ring and $M$ a finitely generated $R$-module with $\dim M=d.$ Let $i\geq 0$ be an integer. Following M. Brodmann and R. Y. Sharp \cite{BS1}, the $i$-th pseudo support of $M$ is the set of all prime ideals $\p$ of $R$ such that $ H^{i-\dim (R/\p)}_{\p R_{\p}}(M_{\p})\neq 0.$ In this paper, we study the pseudo supports and the non Cohen-Macaulay locus of $M$ in connections with the catenarity of the ring $R/\Ann_RM$, the Serre conditions on $M$, and the unmixedness of the local rings $R/\p$ for certain prime ideals $\p$ in $\Supp_R (M)$. "
"Unitary operations are the building blocks of quantum programs. Our task is to design effcient or optimal implementations of these unitary operations by employing the intrinsic physical resources of a given n-qubit system. The most common versions of this task are known as Hamiltonian simulation and gate simulation, where Hamiltonian simulation can be seen as an infinitesimal version of the general task of gate simulation. We present a Lie-theoretic approach to Hamiltonian simulation and gate simulation. From this, we derive lower bounds on the time complexity in the n-qubit case, generalizing known results to both even and odd n. To achieve this we develop a generalization of the so-called magic basis for two-qubits. As a corollary, we note a connection to entanglement measures of concurrence-type. "
"We prove that the bar construction of an $E_\infty$ algebra forms an $E_\infty$ algebra. To be more precise, we provide the bar construction of an algebra over the surjection operad with the structure of a Hopf algebra over the Barratt-Eccles operad. (The surjection operad and the Barratt-Eccles operad are classical $E_\infty$ operads.) "
"Measurements of a Higgs boson at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) have become increasingly consistent with the predictions of the Standard Model (SM). This fact puts severe constraints on many potential low-energy extensions of the Higgs sector of the SM. In the well-known Two Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM), an `alignment limit' of parameters readily furnishes one SM-like scalar, and can be achieved naturally through an underlying symmetry. Among the other physical states of the 2HDM, a charged scalar $H^\pm$ would provide striking evidence of new physics if observed. We propose a novel technique for the observation of the process $pp\to t b H^\pm \to t\bar{t}b\bar{b}$ in the dileptonic decay channel at the LHC. The reconstruction of events in this channel is complicated by multiple $b$-jets and unobserved neutrinos in the final state. To determine the neutrino momenta, we implement a neutrino weighting procedure to study, for the first time, the $t\bar{t}b\bar{b}$ signature. We further train a pair of boosted decision trees to reconstruct and classify signal events. We determine the resulting reach within the context of naturally aligned 2HDMs, such as the Maximally Symmetric Two Higgs Doublet Model (MS-2HDM). By testing at the integrated luminosity of 150 fb$^{-1}$ achieved in Run 2 of the LHC, we find that this channel may restrict the parameter space of a Type-II MS-2HDM with charged Higgs masses as high as 680 GeV. "
"Pure theory recognizes the dependence of supersonic drag coefficients on both Mach number and Reynolds number, which includes an implicit dependence of drag coefficient on air density. However, many modern approaches to computing trajectories for artillery and small arms treat drag coefficients as a function of Mach number and assume no dependence on Reynolds number. If drag force is strictly proportional to air density for supersonic projectiles (as suggested by applied theory), the drag coefficient should be independent of air density over a range of Mach numbers. Experimental data to directly support this are not widely available for supersonic projectiles. The experiment determined drag on a 2.59 g projectile from M1.2 to M2.9 using optical chronographs to measure initial and final velocities over a separation of 91.44 m. The free flight determination of drag coefficients was performed at two significantly different atmospheric densities (0.93 kg/m3 and 1.15 kg/m3 ). This experiment supported direct proportionality of aerodynamic drag to air density from M1.2 to M2.9 within the experimental error of 1%-2%. "
"Design details of a 127 degree electrostatic cylindrical spectrometer equipped with a position-sensitive micro-channel plate detector for measuring the sputtered ions in collisions of highly charged ions with solid surface is described. The nonlinear relationship between the point of fall versus the ionic energy, the blurring of the point of fall caused by the divergence of incident angle and the finite entrance aperture, the transform from a position spectrum to an energy spectrum, as well as the influence of the fringing fields are discussed. "
"Genetic and environmental perturbation experiments have been used to study microbes in a bid to gain insight into transcriptional regulation, adaptive evolution, and other cellular dynamics. These studies have potential in enabling rational strain design. Unfortunately, experimentally determined intracellular flux distribution are often inconsistent or incomparable due to different experimental conditions and methodologies. Computational strain design relies on constraint-based reconstruction and analysis (COBRA) techniques to predict the effect of gene knockouts such as flux balance analysis (FBA), regulatory on/off minimization(ROOM), minimization of metabolic adjustment (MOMA), relative optimality in metabolic networks (RELATCH). Most of these knock-out prediction methods are based on conserving inherent flux patterns (between wild type and mutant) that are thought to be representative of the cellular regulatory structure. However, it has been recently demonstrated that these methods show poor agreement with experimental data. To improve the fidelity of knockout predictions and subsequent computational strain design, we developed REMEP, a metabolite-centric method. We demonstrate the improved performance of REMEP by comparing the different methods on experimental knockout data of E. coli, and S. cerevisiae grown in batch cultures. REMEP retains most of the features of earlier algorithms but is much more accurate in capturing cellular responses to genetic perturbations. A primary reason for this is that REMEP relies on the assumption that cellular regulatory structure leaves a signature on metabolite patterns and not just flux patterns. REMEP will also prove useful in uncovering novel insights into cellular regulation and control. "
"It has been conjectured that the Abelian projection of QCD is responsible for the confinement of color. Using a gauge independent definition of the Abelian projection which does {\it not} employ any gauge fixing, we provide a strong evidence for the Abelian dominance in Wilson loop integral. In specific we prove that the gauge potential which contributes to the Wilson loop integral is precisely the one restricted by the Abelian projection. "
"Jacobian conjectures (that nonsingular implies a global inverse) for rational everywhere defined maps of real n-space to itself are considered, with no requirement for a constant Jacobian determinant or a rational inverse. The birational case is proved and the Galois case clarified. Two known special cases of the Strong Real Jacobian Conjecture (SRJC) are generalized to the rational map context. For an invertible map, the associated extension of rational function fields must be of odd degree and must have no nontrivial automorphisms. That disqualifies the Pinchuk counter examples to the SRJC as candidates for invertibility. "
"The current phenomenological determinations of $\alpha_s(M_\tau)$ and $\alpha_s(M_Z)$ are shown to be only marginally consistent with the QCD evolution of the strong coupling constant between $M_Z$ and $M_\tau$. This motivates a revised estimate of $\alpha_s(M_\tau)$ since the perturbative series used to extract $\alpha_s(M_\tau)$ from the $\tau$ hadronic width exhibits slow convergence. Pad\'e summation techniques provide an estimate of these unknown higher-order effects, leading to the revised determination $\alpha_s(M_\tau)=0.333\pm 0.030 $. This value is 10% smaller than current estimates, improving the compatibility of phenomenological estimates for $\alpha_s(M_\tau)$ and $\alpha_s(M_Z)$ with the QCD evolution of the strong coupling constant.

"The moduli space of Riemann surfaces of genus $g\geq 2$ is (up to a finite \'etale cover) a complex manifold and so it makes sense to speak of its Dolbeault cohomological dimension. The conjecturally optimal bound is $g-2$. This expectation is verified in low genus and supported by Harer's computation of its de Rham cohomological dimension and by vanishing results in the tautological intersection ring. In this paper we prove that such dimension is at most $2g-2$. We also prove an analogous bound for the moduli space of Riemann surfaces with marked points. The key step is to show that the Dolbeault cohomological dimension of each stratum of translation surfaces is at most $g$. In order to do that, we produce an exhaustion function whose complex Hessian has controlled index: the construction of such a function relies on some basic geometric properties of translation surfaces. "
"We provide ready-to-use time-domain gravitational waveforms for spinning compact binaries with precession effects through 1.5PN order in amplitude and compute their mode decomposition using spin-weighted -2 spherical harmonics. In the presence of precession, the gravitational-wave modes (l,m) contain harmonics originating from combinations of the orbital frequency and precession frequencies. We find that the gravitational radiation from binary systems with large mass asymmetry and large inclination angle can be distributed among several modes. For example, during the last stages of inspiral, for some maximally spinning configurations, the amplitude of the (2,0) and (2,1) modes can be comparable to the amplitude of the (2,2) mode. If the mass ratio is not too extreme, the l=3 and l=4 modes are generally one or two orders of magnitude smaller than the l = 2 modes. Restricting ourselves to spinning, non-precessing compact binaries, we apply the stationary-phase approximation and derive the frequency-domain gravitational waveforms including spin-orbit and spin(1)- spin(2) effects through 1.5PN and 2PN order respectively in amplitude, and 2.5PN order in phase. Since spin effects in the amplitude through 2PN order affect only the first and second harmonics of the orbital phase, they do not extend the mass reach of gravitational-wave detectors. However, they can interfere with other harmonics and lower or raise the signal-to-noise ratio depending on the spin orientation. These ready-to-use waveforms could be employed in the data-analysis of the spinning, inspiraling binaries as well as in comparison studies at the interface between analytical and numerical relativity.

"Rotation estimation of known rigid objects is important for robotic applications such as dexterous manipulation. Most existing methods for rotation estimation use intermediate representations such as templates, global or local feature descriptors, or object coordinates, which require multiple steps in order to infer the object pose. We propose to directly regress a pose vector from raw point cloud segments using a convolutional neural network. Experimental results show that our method can potentially achieve competitive performance compared to a state-of-the-art method, while also showing more robustness against occlusion. Our method does not require any post processing such as refinement with the iterative closest point algorithm. "

In this article we define a natural tropicalization procedure for closed subsets of log-regular varieties in the case of constant coefficients and study its basic properties. This framework allows us to generalize some of Tevelev's results on tropical compactification as well as Hacking's result on the cohomology of the link of a tropical variety to log-regular varieties.
"Hybrid quantum systems with inherently distinct degrees of freedom play a key role in many physical phenomena. Famous examples include cavity quantum electrodynamics, trapped ions, or electrons and phonons in the solid state. Here, a strong coupling makes the constituents loose their individual character and form dressed states. Apart from fundamental significance, hybrid systems can be exploited for practical purpose, noteworthily in the emerging field of quantum information control. A promising direction is provided by the combination between long-lived atomic states and the accessible electrical degrees of freedom in superconducting cavities and qubits. Here we integrate circuit cavity quantum electrodynamics with phonons. Besides coupling to a microwave cavity, our superconducting transmon qubit interacts with a phonon mode in a micromechanical resonator, thus representing an atom coupled to two different cavities. We measure the phonon Stark shift, as well as the splitting of the qubit spectral line into motional sidebands, which feature transitions between the dressed electromechanical states. In the time domain, we observe coherent conversion of qubit excitation to phonons as sideband Rabi oscillations. This is a model system having potential for a quantum interface, which may allow for storage of quantum information in long-lived phonon states, coupling to optical photons, or for investigations of strongly coupled quantum systems near the classical limit. "
"We reformulate perturbation theory for neutrino oscillations in matter with an expansion parameter related to the ratio of the solar to the atmospheric $\Delta m^2$ scales. Unlike previous works, we use a renormalized basis in which certain first-order effects are taken into account in the zeroth-order Hamiltonian. We show that the new framework has an exceptional feature that leads to the neutrino oscillation probability in matter with the same structure as in vacuum to first order in the expansion parameter. It facilitates immediate physical interpretation of the formulas, and makes the expressions for the neutrino oscillation probabilities extremely simple and compact. We find, for example, that the $\nu_e$ disappearance probability at this order is of a simple two-flavor form with an appropriately identified mixing angle and $\Delta m^2$. More generally, all the oscillation probabilities can be written in the universal form with the channel-discrimination coefficient of $0,~\pm1$ or simple functions of $\theta_{23}$. Despite their simple forms they include all order effects of $\theta_{13}$ and all order effects of the matter potential, to first order in our expansion parameter. "
"Using the Galaxy as an example, we study the effect of j x B force on the rotational curves of gas and plasma in galaxies. Acceptable model for the galactic magnetic field and plausible physical parameters are used to fit the flat rotational curve for gas and plasma based on the observed baryonic (visible) matter distribution and j x B force term in the static MHD equation of motion. We also study the effects of varied strength of the magnetic field, its pitch angle and length scale on the rotational curves. We show that j x B force does not play an important role on the plasma dynamics in the intermediate range of distances 6-12 kpc from the centre, whilst the effect is sizable for larger r (r > 15 kpc), where it is the most crucial.

"It is argued that systematically unbiassing estimators is not always justified and can be counter-productive. On the contrary, a general rule is given to build a (slightly) biased but consistent estimator which is always closer to the value being estimated than the unbiased estimator from which one has started. "
"Quantum effects in statistical mechanics are important when the thermal wavelength is of the order of, or greater than, the mean interatomic spacing. This is examined at depth taking the example of a hard-sphere Boltzmann gas. Using the virial expansion for the equation of state, it is shown that the interaction energy of a classical hard-sphere gas is exactly zero. When the (second) virial coefficient of such a gas is obtained quantum mechanically, however, the quantum contribution to the interaction energy is shown to be substantial. The importance of the semiclassical corrections to the interaction energy shows up dramatically in such a system. "
"The Schwarzschild space is one of the best studied spacetimes and its exhaustive considerations are easily accessible. Nevertheless, by some reasons it is still surrounded by a lot of misconceptions, myths, and ""paradoxes"". In this pedagogical paper an attempt is made to give a simple (i. e., without cumbersome calculations), but rigorous consideration to the relevant questions. I argue that 1) an observer falling into a Schwarzschild black hole will \emph{not} see ""the entire history of the universe"" 2) he will \emph{not} cross the horizon at the speed of light 3) when inside the hole, he will \emph{not} see the (future) singularity and 4) the latter is \emph{not} ""central"". "
"In this paper, we study both the continuous model and the discrete model of the Quantum Hall Effect (QHE) on the hyperbolic plane. The Hall conductivity is identified as a geometric invariant associated to an imprimitivity algebra of observables. We define a twisted analogue of the Kasparov map, which enables us to use the pairing between $K$-theory and cyclic cohomology theory, to identify this geometric invariant with a topological index, thereby proving the integrality of the Hall conductivity in this case. "
"We exploit the possibility of new configurations in three-body halo nuclei - Samba type - (the neutron-core form a bound system) as a doorway to Borromean systems. The nuclei $^{12}$Be, $^{15}$B, $^{23}$N and $^{27}$F are of such nature, in particular $^{23}$N with a half-life of 37.7 s and a halo radius of 6.07 fm is an excellent example of Samba-halo configuration. The fusion below the barrier of the Samba halo nuclei with heavy targets could reveal the so far elusive enhancement and a dominance of one-neutron over two-neutron transfers, in contrast to what was found recently for the Borromean halo nucleus $^6$He + $^{238}$U. "
"Recent theory and measurements of the velocity of current-driven domain walls in magnetic nanowires have re-opened the unresolved question of whether Landau-Lifshitz damping or Gilbert damping provides the more natural description of dissipative magnetization dynamics. In this paper, we argue that (as in the past) experiment cannot distinguish the two, but that Landau-Lifshitz damping nevertheless provides the most physically sensible interpretation of the equation of motion. From this perspective, (i) adiabatic spin-transfer torque dominates the dynamics with small corrections from non-adiabatic effects; (ii) the damping always decreases the magnetic free energy, and (iii) microscopic calculations of damping become consistent with general statistical and thermodynamic considerations.

"The first giant virus was identified in 2003 from a biofilm of an industrial water-cooling tower in England. Later, numerous new giant viruses were found in oceans and freshwater habitats, some of them having even 2,500 genes. We have demonstrated their very likely presence in four soil samples taken from the Kutch Desert (Gujarat, India). Here we describe a bioinformatics work-flow, called the ""Giant Virus Finder"" that is capable to discover the very likely presence of the genomes of giant viruses in metagenomic shotgun-sequenced datasets. The new tool is applied to numerous hot and cold desert soil samples as well as some tundra- and forest soils. We show that most of these samples contain giant viruses, and especially many were found in the Antarctic dry valleys. The results imply that giant viruses could be frequent not only in aqueous habitats, but in a wide spectrum of soils on our planet. "
"A recent experimental study [Pan et al., arXiv: 1902.10262] has shown that fractional quantum Hall effect gaps are essentially consistent with particle-hole symmetry in the lowest Landau level. Motivated by this result, we consider a clean two dimensional electron system (2DES) from the viewpoint of composite fermion mean-field theory. In this short note, we show that while the experiment is manifestly consistent with a Dirac composite fermion theory proposed recently by Son, it can equally well be explained within the framework of non-relativistic composite fermions, first put forward by Halperin, Lee, and Read. "
"Supersymmetry (SUSY) remains one of the leading candidates for physics beyond the Standard Model, and the search for SUSY will be a central focus of future collider experiments. Complementary information on the viability and character of SUSY can be obtained via the analysis of precision electroweak measurements. In this review, we discuss the prospective implications for SUSY of present and future precision studies at low energy. "
"We study the evolution of a massive scalar field surrounding a Schwarzschild black hole and find configurations that can survive for arbitrarily long times, provided the black hole or the scalar field mass is small enough. In particular, both ultra-light scalar field dark matter around supermassive black holes and axion-like scalar fields around primordial black holes can survive for cosmological times. Moreover, these results are quite generic, in the sense that fairly arbitrary initial data evolves, at late times, as a combination of those long-lived configurations. "
"We investigate certain ideals (associated with Blaschke products) of the analytic Lipschitz algebra $A^\alpha$, with $\alpha>1$, that fail to be ""ideal spaces"". The latter means that the ideals in question are not describable by any size condition on the function's modulus. In the case where $\alpha=n$ is an integer, we study this phenomenon for the algebra $H^\infty_n=\{f:f^{(n)}\in H^\infty\}$ rather than for its more manageable Zygmund-type version. This part is based on a new theorem concerning the canonical factorization in $H^\infty_n$. "
"These compounds have long been known as promising thermoelectric materials. Recently it was revealed, that they also have unconventional electronic topology. This renewed interest to the investigation of their transport properties. In order to improve theoretical description of thermoelectric transport in these compounds, we take into account electron scattering beyond commonly used constant relaxation time approximation. Using first principle calculations, we investigate the scattering of charge carriers by phonons and point defects. The dependence of the scattering rate on the energy correlates with that for the total density of states. This implies that in this material not only the intraband, but also the interband scattering is important, especially for bands with low density of states. The Seebeck coefficient and the electrical resistivity of CoSi and of dilute solid solutions Co$_{1-x}$M$_x$Si (M=Fe or Ni, $x<0.1$) are calculated as a function of temperature and the alloy composition. We show that the account of strong energy dependence of relaxation time is important for the description of experimentally observed rapid increase of the resistivity and qualitative change of its temperature dependence with the substitution of cobalt for iron, as well as for the description of the magnitude of the Seebeck coefficient, its temperature and composition dependence. "
"Recently, reversible circuit synthesis has been intensively studied. One of the problems that has not been solved for a long time was exact minimization of gate count (GC) in 4-bit circuits. Finally, last year a tool of practical usage for finding optimal gate count Toffoli networks for any 4-variable function was developed. However, not much work has been done yet on exact minimization of quantum cost (QC) in 4-bit circuits. This paper presents an application of the above mentioned tool to reducing QC of 4-bit reversible circuits. It is shown that for benchmarks and for designs taken from recent publications it is possible to obtain savings in QC of up to 74% comparing with previously known circuits. "
"Let $(\Omega,\mathcal{F},\mathbb{P})$ be a probability space and $\varphi:\ \Omega\times[0,\infty)\to[0,\infty)$ be a Musielak-Orlicz function. In this article, the authors prove that the Doob maximal operator is bounded on the Musielak-Orlicz space $L^{\varphi}(\Omega)$. Using this and extrapolation method, the authors then establish a Fefferman-Stein vector-valued Doob maximal inequality on $L^{\varphi}(\Omega)$. As applications, the authors obtain the dual version of the Doob maximal inequality and the Stein inequality for $L^{\varphi}(\Omega)$, which are new even in weighted Orlicz spaces. The authors then establish the atomic characterizations of martingale Musielak-Orlicz Hardy spaces $H_{\varphi}^s(\Omega)$, $P_{\varphi}(\Omega)$, $Q_{\varphi}(\Omega)$, $H_{\varphi}^S(\Omega)$ and $H_{\varphi}^M(\Omega)$. From these atomic characterizations, the authors further deduce some martingale inequalities between different martingale Musielak-Orlicz Hardy spaces, which essentially improve the corresponding results in Orlicz space case and are also new even in weighted Orlicz spaces. By establishing the Davis decomposition on $H_{\varphi}^S(\Omega)$ and $H_{\varphi}^M(\Omega)$, the authors obtain the Burkholder-Davis-Gundy inequality associated with Musielak--Orlicz functions. Finally, using the previous martingale inequalities, the authors prove that the maximal Fej\'er operator is bounded from $H_{\varphi}[0,1)$ to $L^{\varphi}[0,1)$, which further implies some convergence results of the Fej\'er means; these results are new even for the weighted Hardy spaces.

"Recently, virtual reality, augmented reality, robotics, autonomous driving et al attract much attention of both academic and industrial community, in which image based camera localization is a key task. However, there has not been a complete review on image-based camera localization. It is urgent to map this topic to help people enter the field quickly. In this paper, an overview of image based camera localization is presented. A new and complete kind of classifications for image based camera localization is provided and the related techniques are introduced. Trends for the future development are also discussed. It will be useful to not only researchers but also engineers and other people interested. "
"We investigate the chiral (flavor) structure of tetraquarks, and study chiral transformation properties of the ""non-exotic"" [(3_bar,3)+(3,3_bar)] and [(8,1)+(1,8)] tetraquark chiral multiplets. We find that as long as this kind of tetraquark states contains one quark and one antiquark having the same chirality, such as (q_L q_L \bar q_L \bar q_R + q_R q_R \bar q_R \bar q_L), they transform in the same way as the lowest level (\bar q q) chiral multiplets under chiral transformations. There is only one [(3_bar,3)+(3,3_bar)] chiral multiplet whose quark-antiquark pairs all have the opposite chirality (q_L q_L \bar q_R \bar q_R + q_R q_R \bar q_L \bar q_L), and it transforms differently from others. Based on these studies, we construct local tetraquark currents belonging to the ""non-exotic"" chiral multiplet [(3_bar,3)+(3,3_bar)] and having quantum numbers J^{PC}=1^{-+}. "
"Considering the speed in which humans resolve syntactic ambiguity, and the overwhelming evidence that syntactic ambiguity is resolved through selection of the analysis whose interpretation is the most `sensible', one comes to the conclusion that interpretation, hence parsing take place incrementally, just about every word. Considerations of parsimony in the theory of the syntactic processor lead one to explore the simplest of parsers: one which represents only analyses as defined by the grammar and no other information. Toward this aim of a simple, incremental parser I explore the proposal that the competence grammar is a Combinatory Categorial Grammar (CCG). I address the problem of the proliferating analyses that stem from CCG's associativity of derivation. My solution involves maintaining only the maximally incremental analysis and, when necessary, computing the maximally right-branching analysis. I use results from the study of rewrite systems to show that this computation is efficient. "
"We study the relationship between granular development and magnetic field evolution in the quiet Sun. 6 typical cases are displayed to exhibit interaction between granules and magnetic elements, and we have obtained the following results. (1) A granule develops centrosymmetrically when no magnetic flux emerges within the granular cell. (2) A granule develops and splits noncentrosymmetrically while flux emerges at an outer part of the granular cell. (3) Magnetic flux emergence as a cluster of mixed polarities is detected at the position of a granule as soon as the granule breaks up. (4) A dipole emerges accompanying with the development of a granule, and the two elements of the dipole root in the adjacent intergranular lanes and face each other across the granule. Advected by the horizontal granular motion, the positive element of the dipole then cancels with pre-existing negative flux. (5) Flux cancellation also takes place between a positive element, which is advected by granular flow, and its surrounding negative flux. (6) While magnetic flux cancellation takes place at a granular cell, the granule shrinks and then disappears. (7) Horizontal magnetic fields enhance at the places where dipoles emerge and where opposite polarities cancel with each other, but only the horizontal fields between the dipolar elements point orderly from the positive element to the negative one. Our results reveal that granules and small-scale magnetic flux influence each other. Granular flow advects magnetic flux, and magnetic flux evolution suppresses granular development. There exist extremely large Doppler blue-shifts at the site of one cancelling magnetic element. This phenomenon may be caused by the upward flow produced by magnetic reconnection below the photosphere. "
"In this paper, we discuss the topological classification of time-reversal invariant topological superconductors. Based on the axion field theory developed in a previous work (Phys. Rev. B ${\bf 87}$ 134519 (2013)), we show how a simple quantum anomaly in vortex-crossing process predicts a $\mathbb{Z}_{16}$ classification of interacting topological superconductors, in consistency with other approaches. We also provide a general definition of the quantum anomaly and a general geometric argument that explains the $\mathbb{Z}_{16}$ on more general grounds. Furthermore, we generalize our approach to all $4n$ dimensions (with $n$ an integer), and compare our results with other approaches to the topological classification. "
"We describe the typical homological properties of monomial ideals defined by random generating sets. We show that, under mild assumptions, random monomial ideals (RMI's) will almost always have resolutions of maximal length; that is, the projective dimension will almost always be $n$, where $n$ is the number of variables in the polynomial ring. We give a rigorous proof that Cohen-Macaulayness is a ""rare"" property. We characterize when an RMI is generic/strongly generic, and when it ""is Scarf""---in other words, when the algebraic Scarf complex of $M\subset S=k[x_1,\ldots,x_n]$ gives a minimal free resolution of $S/M$. As a result we see that, outside of a very specific ratio of model parameters, RMI's are Scarf only when they are generic. We end with a discussion of the average magnitude of Betti numbers. "
"A cellular bleb grows when a portion of the cell membrane detaches from the underlying cortex under the influence of a cytoplasmic pressure. We develop a quantitative model for the growth and dynamics of these objects in a simple two-dimensional setting. In particular, we first find the minimum cytoplasmic pressure and minimum unsupported membrane length for a stationary bleb to nucleate and grow as a function of the membrane-cortex adhesion. We next show how a bleb may travel around the periphery of the cell when the cytoplasmic pressure varies in space and time in a prescribed way and find that the traveling speed is governed by the speed of the pressure change induced by local cortical contraction while the shape of the traveling bleb is governed by the speed of cortical healing. Finally, we relax the assumption that the pressure change is prescribed and couple it hydrodynamically to the cortical contraction and membrane deformation. By quantifying the phase space of bleb formation and dynamics, our framework serves to delineate the range and scope of bleb-associated cell motility and synthesizes a variety of experimental observations. "
"Vacuum polarization of massive scalar fields in a thermal state at arbitrary temperature is studied near the horizon of a Reissner-Nordstr\""{o}m black hole. We derived an analytic form of $<\phi^2>$ approximately in the large mass limit near the black hole horizon. We uses the zeroth order WKB approximation and power series expansion near the horizon for the Euclideanized mode function. Our formula for the vacuum polarization shows regular behavior on the horizon if the temperature of the scalar field is equal to the Hawking temperature of the black hole. The finite part of the vacuum polarization agrees with the result of the DeWitt-Schwinger approximation up to $O(m^{-4})$ which is the next leading order of the expansion. "
"The concept of chirality is extended to the Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) and the mu term is forbidden by a gauged U(1)' symmetry. R-parity automatically emerges after symmetry breaking, suppressing proton decay and protecting the LSP. Exotics charged under the SM pose a challenge to traditional SU(5) unification, but unification is still implemented in deconstructed GUTs. Because of the multitude of additional states to the MSSM, the Z' has a large width, and the SM background, neglected in previous theoretical studies, becomes important for Z' discovery. As a result, the LHC reach is reduced from 3.2 TeV, for a Z' with SM decays, to 1.5 TeV, when additional decay channels are included. This model also predicts possibly long-lived colored and electroweak exotics. "
"In this paper, we extend a model of host-parasite co-evolution to incorporate the semi-conservative nature of DNA replication for both the host and the parasite. We find that the optimal mutation rate for the semi-conservative and conservative hosts converge for realistic genome lengths, thus maintaining the admirable agreement between theory and experiment found previously for the conservative model and justifying the conservative approximation in some cases. We demonstrate that, while the optimal mutation rate for a conservative and semi-conservative parasite interacting with a given immune system is similar to that of a conservative parasite, the properties away from this optimum differ significantly. We suspect that this difference, coupled with the requirement that a parasite optimize survival in a range of viable hosts, may help explain why semi-conservative viruses are known to have significantly lower mutation rates than their conservative counterparts. "
"We summarize recent observations and modeling of the brightest Sgr A* flare to be observed simultaneously in (near)-infrared and X-rays to date. Trying to explain the spectral characteristics of this flare through inverse Compton mechanisms implies physical parameters that are unrealistic for Sgr A*. Instead, a ""cooling break"" synchrotron model provides a more feasible explanation for the X-ray emission. In a magnetic field of about 5-30 Gauss the X-ray emitting electrons cool very quickly on the typical dynamical timescale while the NIR-emitting electrons cool more slowly. This produces a spectral break in the model between NIR and X-ray wavelengths that can explain the differences in the observed spectral indices. "
"Nowadays, information spreading on social networks has triggered an explosive attention in various disciplines. Most of previous works in this area mainly focus on discussing the effects of spreading probability or immunization strategy on static networks. However, in real systems, the peer-to-peer network structure changes constantly according to frequently social activities of users. In order to capture this dynamical property and study its impact on information spreading, in this paper, a link rewiring strategy based on the Fermi function is introduced. In the present model, the informed individuals tend to break old links and reconnect to their second-order friends with more uninformed neighbors. Simulation results on the susceptible-infected-recovered (\textit{SIR}) model with fixed recovery time $T=1$ indicate that the information would spread more faster and broader with the proposed rewiring strategy. Extensive analyses of the information cascade size distribution show that the spreading process of the initial steps plays a very important role, that is to say, the information will spread out if it is still survival at the beginning time. The proposed model may shed some light on the in-depth understanding of information spreading on dynamical social networks. "
"Parikh-Wilczek tunnelling framework, which treats Hawking radiation as a tunnelling process, is investigated again. As the first order correction, the log-corrected entropy-area relation naturally emerges in the tunnelling picture if we consider the emission of a spherical shell. The second order correction of the emission rate for the Schwarzschild black hole is calculated too. In this level, the result is still in agreement with the unitary theory, however, the entropy of the black hole will contain three parts: the usual Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, the logarithmic term and the inverse area term. In our results the coefficient of the logarithmic term is -1. Apart from a coefficient, Our correction to the black hole entropy is consistent with that of loop quantum gravity. "
"We propose a modified theory of gravitation constructed by the addition of the term $f(T_{\mu\nu}T^{\mu\nu})$ to the Einstein-Hilbert action, and elaborate a particular case $f(T_{\mu\nu}T^{\mu\nu})=\alpha(T_{\mu\nu}T^{\mu\nu})^{\eta}$, where $\alpha$ and $\eta$ are real constants, dubbed as energy-momentum powered gravity (EMPG). We search for viable cosmologies arising from EMPG especially in the context of the late-time accelerated expansion of the Universe. We investigate the ranges of the EMPG parameters $(\alpha,\eta)$ on theoretical as well as observational grounds leading to the late-time acceleration of the Universe with pressureless matter only, while keeping the successes of standard general relativity at early times. We find that $\eta=0$ corresponds to the $\Lambda$CDM model, whereas $\eta\neq 0$ leads to a $w$CDM-type model. However, the underlying physics of the EMPG model is entirely different in the sense that the energy in the EMPG Universe is sourced by pressureless matter only. Moreover, the energy of the pressureless matter is not conserved, namely, in general it does not dilute as $\rho\propto a^{-3}$ with the expansion of the Universe. Finally, we constrain the parameters of an EMPG-based cosmology with a recent compilation of 28 Hubble parameter measurements, and find that this model describes an evolution of the Universe similar to that in the $\Lambda$CDM model. We briefly discuss that EMPG can be unified with Starobinsky gravity to describe the complete history of the Universe including the inflationary era. "
"It is shown that in adiabatic approximation for nuclei the many-component Coulomb system cannot be described on the basis of the grand canonical ensemble. Using the variational Bogolyubov's procedure for the free energy, the Hohenberg-Kohn theorem is proved in the canonical ensemble for inhomogeneous electron gas at finite temperature. The principal difference between consideration in the framework of quantum statistics in the canonical ensemble and quantum-mechanical consideration of a finite number of particles in infinite volume is established. The problem of universality of the density functional for describing the inhomogeneous electron density in a disordered nuclei field is considered. "
We describe a machine learning based method to identify incorrect entries in translation memories. It extends previous work by Barbu (2015) through incorporating recall-based machine translation and part-of-speech-tagging features. Our system ranked first in the Binary Classification (II) task for two out of three language pairs: English-Italian and English-Spanish.
"We study inverse problems for the Poisson equation with source term the divergence of an $\mathbf{R}^3$-valued measure, that is, the potential $\Phi$ satisfies $$ \Delta \Phi= \text{div} \boldsymbol{\mu}, $$ and $\boldsymbol{\mu}$ is to be reconstructed knowing (a component of) the field grad $\Phi$ on a set disjoint from the support of $\boldsymbol{\mu}$. Such problems arise in several electro-magnetic contexts in the quasi-static regime, for instance when recovering a remanent magnetization from measurements of its magnetic field. We develop methods for recovering $\boldsymbol{\mu}$ based on total variation regularization. We provide sufficient conditions for the unique recovery of $\boldsymbol{\mu}$, asymptotically when the regularization parameter and the noise tend to zero in a combined fashion, when it is uni-directional or when the magnetization has a support which is sparse in the sense that it is purely 1-unrectifiable. Numerical examples are provided to illustrate the main theoretical results. "
"The behaviour of the X-ray number counts of normal galaxies at faint (-18<Log F<-15 cgs in the 0.5-2.0 keV band) fluxes is investigated. The joint use of information from radio, far infrared and X-ray surveys allows the determination of the LogN-LogS of galaxies within a factor-of-3 over the whole flux range considered. "
"The PANDA collaboration intends to build a state-of-the-art detector to study the physics of antiproton annihilation in the charm mass region at the future FAIR facility at GSI, Darmstadt. One major part of the PANDA detector is the straw tube tracker. It will consist of about 6000 individual straws grouped in 11 double layers and filled with an Ar+10%CO_2 gas mixture. The required radial spatial resolution is about 150 micron. Two different methods are considered for longitudinal coordinate measurements - skewed double layers and a novel method based on the time-dependent charge asymmetry. The latter method is presented in this article. "
"During its second Antarctic flight, the CREAM (Cosmic Ray Energetics And Mass) balloon experiment collected data for 28 days, measuring the charge and the energy of cosmic rays (CR) with a redundant system of particle identification and an imaging thin ionization calorimeter. Preliminary direct measurements of the absolute intensities of individual CR nuclei are reported in the elemental range from carbon to iron at very high energy. "
"The numerical extraction of resonant states of open quantum systems is usually a difficult problem. Regularization techniques, such as the mapping to complex coordinates or the addition of Complex Absorbing Potentials are typically employed, as they render resonant wavefunctions localized and therefore normalizable. Physically relevant metastable states have energies that do not depend on the chosen regularization method. Their identification therefore involves cumbersome comparisons between multiple regularised calculations, often performed graphically, which require fine-tuning and specific intuition to avoid approximated, if not wrong, results. In this Letter, we define an operator that explicitly measures such invariance, valid for any arbitrary mapping of spatial coordinates. Resonant states of the system can eventually simply be identified evaluating the expectation value of this operator. Our method eases the extraction of resonant states even for numerical potentials that are difficult to scale to complex coordinates, and avoids the need for ad hoc complex absorbing potentials. We provide explicit evidence of our findings discussing one-dimensional case-studies,also in the presence of external electric fields. "
"In this paper, we introduce a new model for the risk process based on general compound Hawkes process (GCHP) for the arrival of claims. We call it risk model based on general compound Hawkes process (RMGCHP). The Law of Large Numbers (LLN) and the Functional Central Limit Theorem (FCLT) are proved. We also study the main properties of this new risk model, net profit condition, premium principle and ruin time (including ultimate ruin time) applying the LLN and FCLT for the RMGCHP. We show, as applications of our results, similar results for risk model based on compound Hawkes process (RMCHP) and apply them to the classical risk model based on compound Poisson process (RMCPP).

"The most general QCD next-to-leading anomalous-dimension matrix of all possible four-fermion, dimension-six $\Delta F=2$ operators is computed. The results of this calculation can be used in many phenomenological applications, among which the most important are those related to theoretical predictions of $K^0-\bar{K}^0 $ and $B^0-\bar{B}^0$ mixing in several extension of the Standard Model (Supersymmetry, left-right symmetric, multi-Higgs models, etc.), to estimates of the $B^0_s$--$\bar B^0_s$ width difference, $\Delta \Gamma_{B_s}$, and to the calculation of the $O(1/m_b^3)$ corrections for inclusive b-hadron decay rates. "
"We estimate the Ramsey number r(T) = r(T,T) for various trees T, obtaining a precise value for r(T) for a large number of trees of diameter 3. Furthermore we prove that all trees of diameter 3 are Ramsey unsaturated as defined by Balister, Lehel, and Schelp in their article ""Ramsey unsaturated and saturated graphs."" "
"This talk presents conclusions for KM3NeT which may be drawn from latest IceCube results and from optimization studies of the IceCube configuration. It discusses possible coordinated efforts between IceCube and KM3NeT (or, for the time being, IceCube and ANTARES). Finally, it lists ideas for formal relations between neutrino telescopes on the cubic kilometer scale. "
"Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA) is a popular dimensionality reduction technique with a wide range of applications. However, it suffers from the problem of poor scalability. Various approximation methods have been proposed in the past to overcome this problem. The Nystr\""om method, Randomized Nonlinear Component Analysis (RNCA) and Streaming Kernel Principal Component Analysis (SKPCA) were proposed to deal with the scalability issue of KPCA. Despite having theoretical guarantees, their performance in real world learning tasks have not been explored previously. In this work the evaluation of SKPCA, RNCA and Nystr\""om method for the task of classification is done for several real world datasets. The results obtained indicate that SKPCA based features gave much better classification accuracy when compared to the other methods for a very large dataset. "
"An improved $\eps$ expansion in the $d$-dimensional ($d > 2$) stochastic theory of turbulence is constructed at two-loop order which incorporates the effect of pole singularities at $d \to 2$ in coefficients of the $\eps$ expansion of universal quantities. For a proper account of the effect of these singularities two different approaches to the renormalization of the powerlike correlation function of the random force are analyzed near two dimensions. By direct calculation it is shown that the approach based on the mere renormalization of the nonlocal correlation function leads to contradictions at two-loop order. On the other hand, a two-loop calculation in the renormalization scheme with the addition to the force correlation function of a local term to be renormalized instead of the nonlocal one yields consistent results in accordance with the UV renormalization theory. The latter renormalization prescription is used for the two-loop renormalization-group analysis amended with partial resummation of the pole singularities near two dimensions leading to a significant improvement of the agreement with experimental results for the Kolmogorov constant. "
"The photon-ion merged-beams technique was used at a synchrotron light source for measuring absolute cross sections of double and triple photodetachment of O$^{-}$ ions. The experimental photon energy range of 524-543 eV comprised the threshold for K-shell ionization. Using resolving powers of up to 13,000, the position, strength and width of the below-threshold 1s 2s2 2p6 2S resonance as well as the positions of the 1s 2s2 2p5 3P and 1s 2s2 2p5 1P thresholds for K-shell ionization were determined with high precision. In addition, systematically enlarged multi-configuration Dirac-Fock calculations have been performed for the resonant detachment cross sections. Results from these ab-initio computations agree very well with the measurements for the widths and branching fractions for double and triple detachment, if double shake-up (and -down) of the valence electrons and the rearrangement of the electron density is taken into account. For the absolute cross sections, however, a previously found discrepancy between measurements and theory is confirmed. "
"The dynamics of Bose-Einstein condensation in a three-dimensional harmonic trap is studied explicitly including the Bogoliubov approximation for temperatures below the critical one. To model the evolution towards equilibrium at each cooling step, we derive quantum kinetic equations that describe the dynamics of the gas for temperatures above and below the transition temperature. These equations, valid in the Born and Markov approximations, consider the essential role of the chemical potential as the main parameter that signals the transition. The kinetic equation that describes the growth of the condensate below the transition temperature is derived within the Bogoliubov approximation. To illustrate our results we propose an energetic cooling protocol and simulate the whole sequence of the formation of a condensate. "
"In many biological systems, microorganisms swim through complex polymeric fluids, and usually deform the medium at a rate faster than the inverse fluid relaxation time. We address the basic properties of such life at high Deborah number analytically by considering the small-amplitude swimming of a body in an arbitrary complex fluid. Using asymptotic analysis and differential geometry, we show that for a given swimming gait, the time-averaged leading-order swimming kinematics of the body can be expressed as an integral equation on the solution to a series of simpler Newtonian problems. We then use our results to demonstrate that Purcell's scallop theorem, which states that time-reversible body motion cannot be used for locomotion in a Newtonian fluid, breaks down in polymeric fluid environments. "
"We describe a new class of atom-laser coupling schemes which lead to spin-orbit coupled Hamiltonians for ultra-cold neutral atoms. By properly setting the optical phases, a pair of degenerate pseudospin states emerge as the lowest energy states in the spectrum, and are thus immune to collisionally induced decay. These schemes use $N$ cyclically coupled ground or metastable internal states. We specialize to two situations: a three level case giving fixed Rashba coupling, and a four-level case that adds a controllable Dresselhaus contribution. We describe an implementation of the four level scheme for $\Rb87$ and analyze the sensitivity of our approach to realistic experimental limitations and imperfections. Lastly, we argue that no laser coupling scheme can give pure Rashba or Dresselhaus coupling: akin to condensed matter systems, higher order terms spoil the symmetry of these couplings. However, for sufficiently intense laser fields the continuous rotational symmetry approximately holds, making the Rashba Hamiltonian applicable for cold atoms. "
"We present an overview of the EmotionX 2019 Challenge, held at the 7th International Workshop on Natural Language Processing for Social Media (SocialNLP), in conjunction with IJCAI 2019. The challenge entailed predicting emotions in spoken and chat-based dialogues using augmented EmotionLines datasets. EmotionLines contains two distinct datasets: the first includes excerpts from a US-based TV sitcom episode scripts (Friends) and the second contains online chats (EmotionPush). A total of thirty-six teams registered to participate in the challenge. Eleven of the teams successfully submitted their predictions performance evaluation. The top-scoring team achieved a micro-F1 score of 81.5% for the spoken-based dialogues (Friends) and 79.5% for the chat-based dialogues (EmotionPush). "
"In this paper, I revisit the microcanonical partition function, or density of states (DOS), of general relativity. By using the minisuperspace path integral approximation, I directly calculate the $S^2 \times Disc$ topology sector of the DOS of a (quantum) spacetime with an $S^2\times \mathbb{R}$ Lorentzian boundary from the microcanonical path integral, in contrast with previous works in which DOSs are derived by inverse Laplace transformation from various canonical partition functions. Although I found there always exists only one saddle point for any given boundary data, it does not always dominate the possible integration contours. There is another contribution to the path integral other than the saddle point. One of the obtained DOSs has behavior similar to that of the previous DOSs; that is, it exhibits exponential Bekenstein--Hawking entropy for the limited energy range $ (1-\sqrt{2/3}) <GE/R_{b}< (1+\sqrt{2/3})$, where energy $E$ is defined by the Brown--York quasi-local energy momentum tensor and $R_{b}$ is the radius of the boundary $S^2$. In that range, the DOS is dominated by the saddle point. However, for sufficiently high energy, where the saddle point no longer dominates, the DOS approaches a positive constant, different from the previous ones, which approach zero. "
"Motivated by certain current results by Parmar and Pog\'any [9] in which the authors introduced the so-called $p$-extended Mathieu series the main aim of this paper is to present a connection between such series and a various types of Schl\""omilch series. "
"Two-particle correlations in high-energy collision experiments enable the extraction of particle source radii by using the Bose-Einstein enhancement of pion production at low relative momentum $q\propto 1/R$. It was previously observed that in $\rm{p}\rm{p}$ collisions at $\sqrt{s}=7$ TeV the average pair transverse momentum $k_{\rm T}$ range of such analyses is limited due to large background correlations which were attributed to mini-jet phenomena. To investigate this further, an event-shape dependent analysis of Bose-Einstein correlations for pion pairs is performed in this work. By categorizing the events by their transverse sphericity $S_{\rm T}$ into spherical $(S_\textrm{T}>0.7)$ and jet-like $(S_\textrm{T}<0.3)$ events a method was developed that allows for the determination of source radii for much larger values of $k_{\rm T}$ for the first time. Spherical events demonstrate little or no background correlations while jet-like events are dominated by them. This observation agrees with the hypothesis of a mini-jet origin of the non-femtoscopic background correlations and gives new insight into the physics interpretation of the $k_{\rm T}$ dependence of the radii. The emission source size in spherical events shows a substantially diminished $k_{\rm T}$ dependence, while jet-like events show indications of a negative trend with respect to $k_{\rm T}$ in the highest multiplicity events. Regarding the emission source shape, the correlation functions for both event sphericity classes show good agreement with an exponential shape, rather than a Gaussian one. "
"Some recent observations seem to disagree with hierarchical theories of galaxy formation about the role played by major mergers in the late buildup of massive E-S0's. We re-address this question by analysing the morphology, structural distortion level, and star formation enhancement of a sample of massive galaxies (M_* > 5 * 10^10 Msun) lying on the Red Sequence and its surroundings at 0.3 < z < 1.5. We have used an initial sample of ~1800 sources with K_s < 20.5 mag over an area ~155 arcmin^2 on the Groth Strip, combining data from the Rainbow Extragalactic Database and the GOYA Survey. Red galaxy classes that can be directly associated to intermediate stages of major mergers and to their final products have been defined. We report observational evidence of the existence of a dominant evolutionary path among massive red galaxies at 0.6<z<1.5, consisting in the conversion of irregular disks into irregular spheroids, and of these ones into regular spheroids. This result implies that: 1) the massive red regular galaxies at low redshifts derive from the irregular ones populating the Red Sequence and its neighbourhood at earlier epochs up to z~1.5; 2) the progenitors of the bulk of present-day massive red regular galaxies have been blue disks that have migrated to the Red Sequence mostly through major mergers at 0.6 < z < 1.2 (these mergers thus starting at z~1.5); and 3) the formation of E-S0's that end up with M_*> 10^11 Msun at z=0 through gas-rich major mergers has frozen since z~0.6. All these facts support that major mergers have played the dominant role in the definitive buildup of present-day E-S0's with M_*> 10^11 Msun at 0.6<z<1.2, in good agreement with hierarchical scenarios of galaxy formation.

"Recent experiments revealed non-Fermi-liquid resistivity in the unconventional superconductor Sr$_{2}$RuO$_{4}$ when strain pushes one of the Fermi surfaces close to a van Hove singularity. The origin of this behavior and whether it can be understood from a picture of well defined quasiparticles is unclear. We employ a Boltzmann transport analysis beyond the single relaxation-time approximation based on a single band which undergoes a Lifshitz transition, where the Fermi surface crosses a van Hove singularity, either due to uni-axial or epitaxial strain. First analytically investigating impurity scattering, we clarify the role of the diverging density of states together with the locally flat band at the point of the Lifshitz transition. Additionally including electron-electron scattering numerically, we find good qualitative agreement with resistivity measurements on uni-axially strained Sr$_{2}$RuO$_{4}$, including the temperature scaling and the temperature dependence of the resistivity peak. Our results imply that even close to the Lifshitz transition, a description starting from well-defined quasiparticles holds. To test the validity of Boltzmann transport theory near a van Hove singularity, we provide further experimentally accessible parameters, such as thermal transport, the Seebeck coefficient, and Hall resistivity and compare different strain scenarios. "
"We calculate the observable signatures of the first generation of stars at high redshift (5<z<100). To determine the cosmic star-formation history, we use an extension of the Press-Schechter formalism for Cold Dark Matter (CDM) cosmologies that incorporates gas pressure. We calibrate the fraction of gas converted into stars to be 6% so as to reproduce the 1% solar C/H ratio observed in the intergalactic medium (IGM) at z=3. With this star-formation efficiency, we find that NGST would be able to image more than 10^4 star clusters from high redshifts (z>10) within its 4'x4' field of view. If stars occupy a region comparable to the virial radius of the cluster, then 1% of these clusters could be resolved. We calculate the expected number-flux relation and angular size distribution for these early star clusters. We also describe the reionization of the IGM due to the first generation of stars, and the consequent damping of the CMB anisotropies on small angular scales. This damping could be detected below 10 degree angular scales by MAP and PLANCK. "
"The estimation of risk measures recently gained a lot of attention, partly because of the backtesting issues of expected shortfall related to elicitability. In this work we shed a new and fundamental light on optimal estimation procedures of risk measures in terms of bias. We show that once the parameters of a model need to be estimated, one has to take additional care when estimating risks. The typical plug-in approach, for example, introduces a bias which leads to a systematic underestimation of risk. In this regard, we introduce a novel notion of unbiasedness to the estimation of risk which is motivated by economic principles. In general, the proposed concept does not coincide with the well-known statistical notion of unbiasedness. We show that an appropriate bias correction is available for many well-known estimators. In particular, we consider value-at-risk and expected shortfall (tail value-at-risk). In the special case of normal distributions, closed-formed solutions for unbiased estimators can be obtained. We present a number of motivating examples which show the outperformance of unbiased estimators in many circumstances. The unbiasedness has a direct impact on backtesting and therefore adds a further viewpoint to established statistical properties. "
In this work we show that the only White surface in the projective 5-space having an excess of trisecant lines is the polygonal surface constructed by C. Segre. The proof follows the line of B.Gambier's beautiful approach to this question and is intended to give it modern rigour. This has some implications on the geometry of the generic point of the principal componant of the Hilbert scheme of 18 points in the projective plane special in degree 5.
"Most of the current Global 21-cm experiments include ground screens that help moderate effects from the Earth. In this paper, we report on a possible systematic artifact within the ground plane that may produce broad absorption features in the spectra observed by these experiments. Using analytical approximations and numerical modeling, the origin of the artifact and its impact on the sky-averaged spectrum are described. The publicly released EDGES dataset, from which a 78 MHz absorption feature was recently suggested, is used to probe for the potential presence of ground plane resonances. While the lack of a noise level for the EDGES spectrum makes traditional goodness-of-fit statistics unattainable, the rms residual can be used to assess the relative goodness of fits performed under similar circumstances. The fit to the EDGES spectrum using a model with a simple 2-term foreground and three cavity-mode resonances is compared to a fit to the same spectrum with a model used by the EDGES team consisting of a 5-term foreground and a flattened Gaussian signal. The fits with the physically motivated resonance and empirical flattened Gaussian models have rms residuals of 20.8 mK (11 parameters) and 24.5 mK (9 parameters), respectively, allowing us to conclude that ground plane resonances constitute another plausible explanation for the EDGES data. "
"In this paper we seek static spherically symmetric solutions of Horava-Lifshitz-like gravity with projectability condition. We consider the most general form of gravity action without detailed balance, and require the spacetime metric to respect the projectability condition. We find that for any value of $\lambda$, it may exists the solutions of topology $R\times M_3$, where $R$ is the time direction and $M_3$ is a three-dimensional maximally symmetric space depending on the value of cosmological constant and the potential of the action. Besides, in the UV region where $\lambda\neq 1$, we find Minkowski or de-Sitter space-time as the solution, while in the IR region where $\lambda=1$, we prove that (dS-)Schwarzschild solution is the only nontrivial solution. We also notice that the other static spherically symmetric solutions found in the literature do not satisfy the projectability condition and are not the solutions we get. Our study shows that in Horava-Lifshitz gravity with projectability condition, there is no novel correction to Einstein's general relativity in solar system tests. "
"We have measured the HI absorption towards pulsar B0329+54 using the Green Bank Telescope during 18 epochs between 2002 June 30 and 2003 October 10. Three observing epochs consisted of a continuous period of 20 hours each, while fifteen epochs were 1-2 hours each. We calculate the structure function of HI absorption variations toward the pulsar on time scales of 10 minutes to 16 months which, using the proper motion of 95 km/s and the parallactic distance of 1.03 kpc measured towards B0329+54 (Brisken et al. 2002), corresponds to angular scales of 0.37 micro-arcseconds to 23.8 milli-arseconds and samples structures between 0.0025-12.5 AU assuming HI gas half way to the pulsar and ignoring scintillation effects. We find no evidence for any turbulent HI absorption fluctuations towards B0329+54, with the following upper limits on the change in opacity for various absorption features: 0.026 at -31, -21, -18, and +4 km/s, 0.12 at -11 km/s, and 0.055 at -1 km/s.

"Much has been written on reciprocity laws in number theory and their connections with group representations. In this paper we explore more on these connections. We prove a ""reciprocity Law"" for certain specific representations of semidirect products of two cyclic groups which is in complete analogy with classical reciprocity laws in number theory. In fact, we show that the celebrated quadratic reciprocity law is a direct consequence of our main theorem applied to a specific group. As another consequence of our main theorem we also recover a classical theorem of Sylvester. Our main focus is on explicit constructions of representations over sufficiently small fields. These investigations give further evidence that there is still much unexplored territory in connections between number theory and group representations, even at an elementary level. "
"We consider a scenario of cosmological inflation coming from a grand unified theory in higher dimensional orbifold. Flatness of the potential is automatically guaranteed in this orbifold setup thanks to the nonlocality of the Wilson line on higher dimensions and the local quantum gravitational corrections are exponentially suppressed. The spectral index of scalar perturbation (n_s =0.92 - 0.97) and a significant production of gravitational waves are predicted (r= T/S= 0.01 - 0.12) in the perturbative regime of gauge interaction, (1/g_4 = (5-20) X 2 pi R Mpl) where the size of compactification is constrained (R Mpl = 20- 45) by the measurement of scalar power spectrum (Delta_R = 5 X 10^-5).

"The Schrodinger equation for the Manning-Rosen potential with the centrifugal term is solved approximately to obtain bound states energies. Additionally, the corresponding wave functions are expressed by the Jacobi polynomials. The Nikiforov-Uvarov (${\rm NU}$) method is used in the calculations. To show the accuracy of our results, we calculate the eigenvalues numerically for arbitrary quantum numbers $n$ and $l$ with two different values of the potential parameter $\alpha .$ It is shown that the results are in good agreement with the those obtained by other methods for short potential range, small $l$ and $\alpha .$ This solution reduces to two cases $l=0$ and Hulthen potential case.

"The ternary Goldbach conjecture (or three-prime conjecture) states that every odd number greater than 5 can be written as the sum of three primes. The purpose of this book is to give the first proof of the conjecture, in full. "
An approximate local potential for the residual pi+ pi+ interaction is computed. We use an O(a**2) improved action on a coarse 9x9x9x13 lattice with approximately a=0.4fm. The results present a continuation of previous work: Increasing the number of gauge configurations and quark propagators we attempt extrapolation of the pi+ pi+ potential to the chiral limit.
"In this note we exhibit a very simple proof of McNaughton Theorem, almost right out of the definitions, and at the same time we observe that this theorem does not depend of Chang's completeness theorem. "
"Let $G$ be an additive finite abelian group with exponent $\exp(G)=m$. For any positive integer $k$, the $k$-th generalized Erd\H{o}s-Ginzburg-Ziv constant $\mathsf s_{km}(G)$ is defined as the smallest positive integer $t$ such that every sequence $S$ in $G$ of length at least $t$ has a zero-sum subsequence of length $km$. It is easy to see that $\mathsf s_{kn}(C_n^r)\ge(k+r)n-r$ where $n,r\in\mathbb N$. Kubertin conjectured that the equality holds for any $k\ge r$. In this paper, we mainly prove the following results: (1) For every positive integer $k\ge 6$, we have $$\mathsf s_{kn}(C_n^3)=(k+3)n+O(\frac{n}{\ln n}).$$ (2) For every positive integer $k\ge 18$, we have $$\mathsf s_{kn}(C_n^4)=(k+4)n+O(\frac{n}{\ln n}).$$ (3) For $n\in \mathbb N$, assume that the largest prime power divisor of $n$ is $p^a$ for some $a\in\mathbb N$. For any fixed $r\ge 5$, if $p^t\ge r$ for some $t\in\mathbb N$, then for any $k\in\mathbb N$ we have $$\mathsf s_{kp^tn}(C_n^r)\le(kp^t+r)n+c_r\frac{n}{\ln n},$$ where $c_r$ is a constant depends on $r$. Note that the main terms in our results are consistent with the conjectural values proposed by Kubertin. "
"Astroparticle physics has recently reached a new status of precision due to the construction of new observatories, operating innovative technologies and the detection of large numbers of events and sources. The precise measurements of cosmic and gamma rays can be used as a test for fundamental physics, such as the Lorentz invariance violation (LV). Although LV signatures are expected to be small, the very high energies and long distances that astrophysical sources involve, lead to an unprecedented opportunity for this task. In this summary, exclusion limits results are presented from different types of astrophysical LV tests through the generic modification of the particle dispersion relation in the photon sector through the pair production threshold shifts and photon decay. Some perspectives for the next generations of gamma-ray telescopes are also addressed "
We consider complex projective space with its Fubini-Study metric and the X-ray transform defined by integration over its geodesics. We identify the kernel of this transform acting on symmetric tensor fields.
"Entanglement of purification was introduced by Terhal et al. for characterizing the bound of the generation of correlated states from maximally entangled states with sublinear size of classical communication. On the other hand, M. Horodecki obtained the optimal compression rate with a mixed states ensemble in the visible setting. In this paper, we prove that the optimal visible compression rate for mixed states is equal to the limit of the regularized entanglement of purification of the state corresponding to the given ensemble. This result gives a new interpretation to the entanglement of purification. "
"We extend the adiabatic regularization method by introducing an arbitrary mass scale $\mu$ in the construction of the subtraction terms. This allows us to obtain, in a very robust way, the running of the coupling constants by demanding $\mu$-invariance of the effective semiclassical (Maxwell-Einstein) equations. In particular, we get the running of the electric charge of perturbative quantum electrodynamics. Furthermore, the method brings about a renormalization of the cosmological constant and the Newtonian gravitational constant. The running obtained for these dimensionful coupling constants has new relevant (non-logarithmic) contributions, not predicted by dimensional regularization. "
"Using observations made with the XMM-Newton Observatory, we report the probable X-ray detection of the high-magnetic-field radio pulsar PSR J1734-3333. This pulsar has an inferred surface dipole magnetic field of B = 5.2e13 G, just below that of one anomalous X-ray pulsar (AXP). We find that the pulsar has an absorbed 0.5-2.0 keV flux of (5-15)e-15 erg/s/cm^2 and that its X-ray luminosity L_X is well below its spin down luminosity E_dot, with L_X < 0.1E_dot. No pulsations were detected in these data although our derived upper limit is unconstraining. Like most of the other high-B pulsars, PSR J1734-3333 is X-ray faint with no sign of magnetar activity. We collect and tabulate the properties of this and all other known high-B radio pulsars with measured X-ray luminosities or luminosity upper limits and plot L_X versus B for them all. "
"The null vectors of an arbitrary highest weight representation of the $WA_2$ algebra are constructed. Using an extension of the enveloping algebra by allowing complex powers of one of the generators, analysed by Kent for the Virasoro theory, we generate all the singular vectors indicated by the Kac determinant. We prove that the singular vectors with given weights are unique up to normalisation and consider the case when $W_0$ is not diagonalisable among the singular vectors. "
"We present catalogues of voids for the SDSS DR7 redshift survey and for Millennium I simulation mock data. We aim to compare the observations with simulations based on a $\Lambda$CDM model and a semi-analytic galaxy formation model. We use the void statistics as a test for these models. We assembled a mock catalogue that closely resembles the SDSS DR7 catalogue and carried out a parallel statistical analysis of the observed and simulated catalogue. We find that in the observation and the simulation, voids tend to be equally spherical. The total volume occupied by the voids and their total number are slightly larger in the simulation than in the observation. We find that large voids are less abundant in the simulation and the total luminosity of the galaxies contained in a void with a given radius is higher on average than observed by SDSS DR7 survey. We expect these discrepancies to be even more significant in reality than found here since the present value of $\sigma_8$ given by WMAP7 is lower than the value of 0.9 used in the Millennium I simulation. The reason why the simulation fails to produce enough large and dark voids might be the failure of certain semi-analytic galaxy formation models to reduce the small-scale power of $\Lambda$CDM and to produce sufficient power on large scales. "
"Phosphorene, a two-dimensional (2D) analog of black phosphorous, has been a subject of immense interest recently, due to its high carrier mobilities and a tunable bandgap. So far, tunability has been predicted to be obtained with very high compressive/tensile in-plane strains, and vertical electric field, which are difficult to achieve experimentally. Here, we show using density functional theory based calculations the possibility of tuning electronic properties by applying normal compressive strain in bilayer phosphorene. A complete and fully reversible semiconductor to metal transition has been observed at $\sim13.35\%$ strain, which can be easily realized experimentally. Furthermore, a direct to indirect bandgap transition has also been observed at $\sim3\%$ strain, which is a signature of unique band-gap modulation pattern in this material. The absence of negative frequencies in phonon spectra as a function of strain demonstrates the structural integrity of the sheets at relatively higher strain range. The carrier mobilities and effective masses also do not change significantly as a function of strain, keeping the transport properties nearly unchanged. This inherent ease of tunability of electronic properties without affecting the excellent transport properties of phosphorene sheets is expected to pave way for further fundamental research leading to phosphorene-based multi-physics devices.

"The occurrence of energetic and dynamical instabilities in a Bose-Einstein condensate moving in a one-dimensional (1D) optical lattice is analyzed by means of the Gross-Pitaevskii theory. Results of full 3D calculations are compared with those of an effective 1D model, the nonpolynomial Schrodinger equation, pointing out the role played by transverse degrees of freedom. The instability thresholds are shown to be scarcely affected by transverse excitations, so that they can be accurately predicted by effective 1D models. Conversely, transverse excitations turn out to be important in characterizing the stability diagram and the occurrence of a complex radial dynamics above the threshold for dynamical instability. This analysis provides a realistic framework to discuss the dissipative dynamics observed in recent experiments. "
"The emission rate of a point dipole can be strongly increased in presence of a well-designed optical antenna. Yet, optical antenna design is largely based on radio-frequency rules, ignoring e.g.~ohmic losses and non-negligible field penetration in metals at optical frequencies. Here we combine reciprocity and Poynting's theorem to derive a set of optical-frequency antenna design rules for benchmarking and optimizing the performance of optical antennas driven by single quantum emitters. Based on these findings a novel plasmonic cavity antenna design is presented exhibiting a considerably improved performance compared to a reference two-wire antenna. Our work will be useful for the design of high-performance optical antennas and nanoresonators for diverse applications ranging from quantum optics to antenna-enhanced single-emitter spectroscopy and sensing. "
"Optimization-based models have been used to predict cellular behavior for over 25 years. The constraints in these models are derived from genome annotations, measured macro-molecular composition of cells, and by measuring the cell's growth rate and metabolism in different conditions. The cellular goal (the optimization problem that the cell is trying to solve) can be challenging to derive experimentally for many organisms, including human or mammalian cells, which have complex metabolic capabilities and are not well understood. Existing approaches to learning goals from data include (a) estimating a linear objective function, or (b) estimating linear constraints that model complex biochemical reactions and constrain the cell's operation. The latter approach is important because often the known/observed biochemical reactions are not enough to explain observations, and hence there is a need to extend automatically the model complexity by learning new chemical reactions. However, this leads to nonconvex optimization problems, and existing tools cannot scale to realistically large metabolic models. Hence, constraint estimation is still used sparingly despite its benefits for modeling cell metabolism, which is important for developing novel antimicrobials against pathogens, discovering cancer drug targets, and producing value-added chemicals. Here, we develop the first approach to estimating constraint reactions from data that can scale to realistically large metabolic models. Previous tools have been used on problems having less than 75 biochemical reactions and 60 metabolites, which limits real-life-size applications. We perform extensive experiments using 75 large-scale metabolic network models for different organisms (including bacteria, yeasts, and mammals) and show that our algorithm can recover cellular constraint reactions, even when some measurements are missing. "
"Using Density Functional Theory (DFT) method we compute linear optical absorption spectra and nonlinear optical susceptibilities of hydrogen passivated armchair and zigzag Phosphorous Nanoribbons (aPNR and zPNR) as well as \alpha-phase phosphorous monolayer. We observe that: (a) Crystallographic direction has a strong effect on the band edge absorption which causes optical anisotropy as well as a red shift of absorption spectra by increasing the nanoribbon width. (b) The absorption values are in the order of $10^{5} cm^{-1}$ which are similar to the experimentally measured values. (c) There is two orders of magnitude enhancement of the 2nd order nonlinear optical susceptibility, $\chi^{(2)}$, in nanoribbons which emanates from breaking the centro-symmetric structure of a monolayer phosphorene by hydrogen surface terminations. (d) Chief among our results is that the 3rd order susceptibility, $\chi^{(3)}$, for phosphorene monolayer and nanoribbons are about $~10^{-13}$ esu ($~10^{-21} \frac{m^{2}}{V^{2}}$) which are in close agreement with experimentally reported values as well as a recently calculated value based on semi-analytic method. This strongly supports reliability of our method in calculating nonlinear optical susceptibilities of phosphorene and in general other nanostructures. Enhanced 2nd order optical nonlinearity in phosphorene promises better second harmonic and frequency difference (THz) generation for photonics applications. "
"The identification of pollutant effects is an important task in environmental health. Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) is a standard tool for inference of individual-level pollutant health-effects, and we present a mean field Variational Inference (VI) algorithm for quick inference when only a single response per individual is recorded. Using simulation studies in the case of informative priors, we show that VI, although fast, produces anti-conservative credible intervals of covariate effects and conservative credible intervals for pollutant effects. To correct the coverage probabilities of covariate effects, we propose a simple Generalized Least Squares (GLS) approach that induces conservative credible intervals. We also explore using BKMR with flat priors and find that, while slower than the case with informative priors, this approach yields uncorrected credible intervals for covariate effects with coverage probabilities that are much closer to the nominal 95% level. We further note that fitting BKMR by VI provides a remarkable improvement in speed over existing MCMC methods. "
"The Poisson structures on two-dimensional Galilei group, classified in the author previous paper are quantized. The dual quantum Galilei Lie algebras are found. "
"We describe a set of techniques for performing large scale ab initio calculations using multigrid accelerations and a real-space grid as a basis. The multigrid methods provide effective convergence acceleration and preconditioning on all length scales, thereby permitting efficient calculations for ill-conditioned systems with long length scales or high energy cut-offs. We discuss specific implementations of multigrid and real-space algorithms for electronic structure calculations, including an efficient multigrid-accelerated solver for Kohn-Sham equations, compact yet accurate discretization schemes for the Kohn-Sham and Poisson equations, optimized pseudo\-potentials for real-space calculations, efficacious computation of ionic forces, and a complex-wavefunction implementation for arbitrary sampling of the Brillioun zone. A particular strength of a real-space multigrid approach is its ready adaptability to massively parallel computer architectures, and we present an implementation for the Cray-T3D with essentially linear scaling of the execution time with the number of processors. The method has been applied to a variety of periodic and non-periodic systems, including disordered Si, a N impurity in diamond, AlN in the wurtzite structure, and bulk Al. The high accuracy of the atomic forces allows for large step molecular dynamics; e.g., in a 1 ps simulation of Si at 1100 K with an ionic step of 80 a.u., the total energy was conserved within 27 microeV per atom. "
"The assumption of nodes in a cooperative communication relay network operating in synchronous fashion is often unrealistic. In the present paper, we consider two different models of asynchronous operation in cooperative-diversity networks experiencing slow fading and examine the corresponding diversity-multiplexing tradeoffs (DMT). For both models, we propose protocols and distributed space-time codes that asymptotically achieve the transmit diversity bound for all multiplexing gains and for any number of relays. "
We develop a point-scattering approach to the plane-wave optical transmission of subwavelength metal hole arrays. We present a real space description instead of the more conventional reciprocal space description; this naturally produces interfering resonant features in the transmission spectra and makes explicit the tensorial properties of the transmission matrix. We give transmission spectra simulations for both square and hexagonal arrays; these can be evaluated at arbitrary angles and polarizations.
"We use results by Chenevier to interpolate the classical Jacquet-Langlands correspondence for Hilbert modular forms, which gives us an extension of Chenevier's results to totally real fields. From this we obtain an isomorphisms between eigenvarieties attached Hilbert modular forms and those attached to modular forms on a totally definite quaternion algebra over a totally real field of even degree.

"The aim of this note is to answer several open problems arising from the geometric description of the $m$-cluster categories of type $A_n$ and their realization in terms of the $m$-th power of a translation quiver. In particular, we give a geometric interpretation of the triangulated structure of $m$-cluster categories. Furthermore, we characterize all the connected components arising from a cluster category when taking the $m$-th power of its Auslander-Reiten quiver. "
"The hot big-bang cosmology provides a reliable accounting of the Universe from about $10^{-2}\sec$ after the bang until the present, as well as a robust framework for speculating back to times as early as $10^{-43}\sec$. Cosmology faces a number of important challenges; foremost among them are determining the quantity and composition of matter in the Universe and developing a detailed and coherent picture of how structure (galaxies, clusters of galaxies, superclusters, voids, great walls, and so on) developed. At present there is a working hypothesis---cold dark matter---which is based upon inflation and which, if correct, would extend the big bang model back to $10^{-32}\sec$ and cast important light on the unification of the forces. Many experiments and observations, from CBR anisotropy experiments to Hubble Space Telescope observations to experiments at Fermilab and CERN, are now putting the cold dark matter theory to the test. At present it appears that the theory is viable only if the Hubble constant is smaller than current measurements indicate (around $30\kms\Mpc^{-1}$), or if the theory is modified slightly, e.g., by the addition of a cosmological constant, a small admixture of hot dark matter ($5\eV$ ``worth of neutrinos''), more relativistic particles, or a tilted spectrum of density perturbations. "
"We consider the strong decays of the lowest-lying radially excited baryons, in SU(6) language the states comprising the first excited 56-plet. Assuming a single-quark decay approximation, and negligible configuration mixing, we make model-independent predictions for the partial decay widths to final states with a single meson. Masses of unobserved states are predicted using results from large-N_c QCD, and the momentum dependence of the one-body decay amplitude is determined phenomenologically by fitting to observed decays, so that the baryon spatial wave functions are not assumed. We point out that comparison of these predictions to experiment may shed light on whether the Roper resonance can be consistently interpreted as a three-quark state. "
"We study the problem of optimizing nonlinear objective functions over matroids presented by oracles or explicitly. Such functions can be interpreted as the balancing of multi-criteria optimization. We provide a combinatorial polynomial time algorithm for arbitrary oracle-presented matroids, that makes repeated use of matroid intersection, and an algebraic algorithm for vectorial matroids. Our work is partly motivated by applications to minimum-aberration model-fitting in experimental design in statistics, which we discuss and demonstrate in detail. "
"Short text matching often faces the challenges that there are great word mismatch and expression diversity between the two texts, which would be further aggravated in languages like Chinese where there is no natural space to segment words explicitly. In this paper, we propose a novel lattice based CNN model (LCNs) to utilize multi-granularity information inherent in the word lattice while maintaining strong ability to deal with the introduced noisy information for matching based question answering in Chinese. We conduct extensive experiments on both document based question answering and knowledge based question answering tasks, and experimental results show that the LCNs models can significantly outperform the state-of-the-art matching models and strong baselines by taking advantages of better ability to distill rich but discriminative information from the word lattice input.

"We give a surface integral derivation of the leading-order evolution equations for the spin and energy of a relativistic body interacting with other bodies in the post-Newtonian expansion scheme. The bodies can be arbitrarily shaped and can be strongly self-gravitating. The effects of all mass and current multipoles are taken into account. As part of the computation one of the 2PN potentials parametrizing the metric is obtained. The formulae obtained here for spin and energy evolution coincide with those obtained by Damour, Soffel and Xu for the case of weakly self-gravitating bodies. By combining an Einstein-Infeld-Hoffman-type surface integral approach with multipolar expansions we extend the domain of validity of these evolution equations to a wide class of strongly self-gravitating bodies. This paper completes in a self-contained way a previous work by Racine and Flanagan on translational equations of motion for compact objects. "
"This work proposes a fully decentralized strategy for maintaining the formation rigidity of a multi-robot system using only range measurements, while still allowing the graph topology to change freely over time. In this direction, a first contribution of this work is an extension of rigidity theory to weighted frameworks and the rigidity eigenvalue, which when positive ensures the infinitesimal rigidity of the framework. We then propose a distributed algorithm for estimating a common relative position reference frame amongst a team of robots with only range measurements in addition to one agent endowed with the capability of measuring the bearing to two other agents. This first estimation step is embedded into a subsequent distributed algorithm for estimating the rigidity eigenvalue associated with the weighted framework. The estimate of the rigidity eigenvalue is finally used to generate a local control action for each agent that both maintains the rigidity property and enforces additional con- straints such as collision avoidance and sensing/communication range limits and occlusions. As an additional feature of our approach, the communication and sensing links among the robots are also left free to change over time while preserving rigidity of the whole framework. The proposed scheme is then experimentally validated with a robotic testbed consisting of 6 quadrotor UAVs operating in a cluttered environment. "
Low energy proton capture reactions have been studied in statistical model using the semi-microscopic optical potential in the mass range A=110-125. Nuclear density obtained from relativistic mean field calculation has been folded with nucleon-nucleon interaction to obtain the optical potential. Theoretical results have been compared with experimental measurements to normalize the potential. Results have also been compared with a standard calculation available in the literature.
"Polarization has proved an invaluable tool for probing magnetic fields in relativistic jets. Maps of the intrinsic polarization vectors have provided the best evidence to date for uniform, toroidally dominated magnetic fields within jets. More recently, maps of the rotation measure (RM) in jets have for the first time probed the field geometry of the cool, moderately relativistic surrounding material. In most cases, clear signatures of toroidal magnetic field are detected, corresponding to gradients in RM profiles transverse to the jet. However, in many objects these profiles also display marked asymmetries which are difficult to explain in simple helical jet models. Furthermore, in some cases the RM profiles are strongly frequency and/or time dependent. Here we show that these features may be naturally accounted for by including relativistic helical motion in the jet model. In particular, we are able to reproduce bent RM profiles observed in a variety of jets, frequency dependent RM profile morphologies and even the time dependence of the RM profiles of knots in 3C 273. Finally, we predict that some sources may show reversals in their RM profiles at sufficiently high frequencies, depending upon the the ratio of the components of jet sheath velocity transverse and parallel to the jet. Thus, multi-frequency RM maps promise a novel way in which to probe the velocity structure of relativistic outflows. "
"We conjecture that three light Majorana neutrinos and their right-handed counterparts may have a universal geometric mass hierarchy. Incorporating this phenomenological conjecture with the Fritzsch texture of lepton mass matrices in a simple seesaw mechanism, we show that it is possible to simultaneously account for current neutrino oscillation data and the cosmological baryon number asymmetry via leptogenesis. "
"The Hilbert-Schmidt distance between a mixed three-qubit state and its closest state is used to quantify the amount of pairwise quantum correlations in a tripartite system. Analytical expressions of geometric quantum discord are derived. A particular attention is devoted to two special classes of three-qubit $X$ states. They include three-qubit states of ${\rm W}$, ${\rm GHZ}$ and Bell type. We also discuss the monogamy property of geometric quantum discord in some mixed three-qubit systems. "
"The stream of words produced by Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems is typically devoid of punctuations and formatting. Most natural language processing applications expect segmented and well-formatted texts as input, which is not available in ASR output. This paper proposes a novel technique of jointly modeling multiple correlated tasks such as punctuation and capitalization using bidirectional recurrent neural networks, which leads to improved performance for each of these tasks. This method could be extended for joint modeling of any other correlated sequence labeling tasks. "
"Any $G$-space isovariantly covered by tubes is the pullback of a classifying space indexed by the orbit types of the tubes and the cardinality of the cover. The $G$-homeomorphism types of $G$-spaces over a given space correspond bijectively to filtered-homotopy classes of stratified maps of orbit spaces. Essential are the unique connected $T_0$ topologies on two- and three-point sets. Applications include classification of unstructured fiber bundles with locally compact Hausdorff fiber and with locally connected fiber or base. We discover the existence part of classification for equivariant principal bundles, which in cases is due to Lashof--May (1986) and L\""uck--Uribe (2014). "
"Restructuring of the power market introduced demand uncertainty in transmission expansion planning (TEP), which in turn also requires an accurate estimation of demand not served (DNS). Unfortunately, the graph theory based minimum-cut maximum-flow (MCMF) approach does not ensure that electrical laws are followed. Nor can it be used for calculating DNS at individual buses. In this letter, we propose a generalized load flow based methodology for calculating DNS. This procedure is able to calculate simultaneously generation not served (GNS) and wheeling loss (WL). Importantly, the procedure is able to incorporate the effect of I2R losses, excluded in MCMF approach. Case study on a 5-bus IEEE system shows the effectiveness of the proposed approach over existing method. "
"We construct topological Wess-Zumino term for supercoset sigma-models on various AdS(3) backgrounds. For appropriately chosen set of parameters, the sigma-model remains integrable when the Wess-Zumino term is added to the action. Moreover, the conditions for integrability, kappa-symmetry and conformal invariance are equivalent to each other. "
"We exhibit pairs of transverse knots with the same self-linking number that are not transversely isotopic, using the recently defined knot Floer homology invariant for transverse knots and some algebraic refinements of it. "
"We consider 2-dimensional orientable self-shrinkers $\Sigma$ for the Mean Curvature Flow of polynomial volume growth immersed in $\mathbb R^n$. We look at closed one forms minimizing the norm $\int_\Sigma \eterm |\omega|^2$ in their cohomology class. Any closed form satisfying the Euler-Lagrange equation for this minimization will be called a Gaussian Harmonic one Form (GHF). We then use these forms to show that if such a $\Sigma$ has genus $\geq 1,$ then we have a lower bound on the supremum norm of $A^2$. GHF's may also be applied to create an upperbound for the lowest eigenvalue of the operator $L$. In the codimension one case $\Sigma \to \mathbb R^3$, for certain conditions on the principal curvatures, we use GHF's to get a lower bound on the index of $L$ depending on the genus $g$. Likewise, in the compact codimension one case we obtain an estimate of the lowest eigenvalue of $L$ and also on $\inf |x|^2$. "
"The mixing between sterile and active neutrinos is taken into account in the calculation of Big Bang Nucleosynthesis. The abundances of primordial elements, like D, 3He, 4He and 7Li, are calculated by including sterile neutrinos, and by using finite chemical potentials. It is found that the resulting theoretical abundances are consistent with WMAP data on baryonic densities, and with limits of LSND on mixing angles, only if 7Li is excluded from the statistical analysis of theoretical and experimental results.

"Though the Planck scale is encountered in Quantum SuperString Theory and Quantum Gravity, it is the Compton scale of elementary particles which is encountered in the physical world. An explanation for this is given in terms of Brownian processes and the duality relation. "
"We study the transformation into a baryon asymmetry of a charge initially stored in a complex (waterfall) scalar field at the end of a hybrid inflation phase as described in Ref[1]. The waterfall field is coupled to right-handed neutrinos, and is also responsible for their Majorana masses. The charge is finally transferred to the leptons of the Standard Model through the decay of the right-handed neutrinos without introducing new CP violating interactions. Other needed processes, like the decay of the inflaton field and the reheating of the Universe are also discussed in detail. "
Experimental data on angular distributions of gamma rays emitted from binary and ternary spontaneous fission of $^{252}{\rm Cf}$ are analyzed. Their difference indicates that the alignment of fragments is higher in ternary fission than in binary one. The consequences of possible relation between the mechanism of ternary fission and the excitation of collective modes during the saddle-to-scission stage are discussed.
"Reversible opto-mechanical molecular switch based on a single azobenzene molecule suspended via thiolate links between realistic models of gold tips is investigated. Using a combination of the transfer matrix technique and density functional theory we focus on conductance of the nano-device in the two (meta)stable cis and trans junction conformations. We find the conductance of both conformations to be broadly similar. In qualitative agreement with related experiments, we find that the same nano-device with one/two methylene linker group(s) inserted on one/both ends of the azobenzene molecule is driven into tunneling regime and reduces the conductances by up to two orders of magnitude, again almost uniformly for both conformations. These results clarify the huge differences in switching ratios found previously and indicate that this nano-device is not particularly suited for use as a molecular switch based on conductance change. "
"We investigate eta photoproduction in the $N^{*}(1535)$ resonance region within the effective Lagrangian approach (ELA), wherein leading contributions to the amplitude at the tree level are taken into account. These include the nucleon Born terms and the leading $t$-channel vector meson exchanges as the non-resonant pieces. In addition, we consider five resonance contributions in the $s$- and $u$- channel; besides the dominant $N^{*}(1535)$, these are: $N^{*}(1440),N^{*}(1520),N^{*}(1650)$ and $N^{*}(1710)$. The amplitudes for the $\pi^\circ$ and the $\eta$ photoproduction near threshold have significant differences, even as they share common contributions, such as those of the nucleon Born terms. Among these differences, the contribution to the $\eta$ photoproduction of the $s$-channel excitation of the $N^{*}(1535)$ is the most significant. We find the off-shell properties of the spin-3/2 resonances to be important in determining the background contributions. Fitting our effective amplitude to the available data base allows us to extract the quantity $\sqrt{\chi \Gamma_\eta} A_{1/2}/\Gamma_T$, characteristic of the photoexcitation of the $N^{*}(1535)$ resonance and its decay into the $\eta$-nucleon channel, of interest to precise tests of hadron models. At the photon point, we determine it to be $(2.2\pm 0.2)\times 10^{-1} GeV^{-1}$ from the old data base, and $(2.2\pm 0.1) \times 10^{-1} GeV^{-1}$ from a combination of old data base and new Bates data. We obtain the helicity amplitude for $N^{*}(1535)\rightarrow \gamma p$ to be $A_{1/2}=(97\pm 7)\times 10^{-3} GeV^{-1/2}$ from the old data base, and $A_{1/2}=(97\pm 6)\times 10^{-3} GeV^{-1/2}$ from the combination of the old data base and new Bates data, compared with the results of the analysis of pion photoproduction yielding $74\pm 11$, in the same units.

"Metal-poor stars in the Milky Way are local relics of the epoch of the first stars and the first galaxies. However, a low metallicity does not prove that a star formed in this ancient era, as metal-poor stars form over a range of redshift in different environments. Theoretical models of Milky Way formation have shown that at constant metallicity, the oldest stars are those closest to the center of the Galaxy on the most tightly-bound orbits. For that reason, the most metal-poor stars in the bulge of the Milky Way provide excellent tracers of the chemistry of the high-redshift universe. We report the dynamics and detailed chemical abundances of three stars in the bulge with [Fe/H] $\lesssim-2.7$, two of which are the most metal-poor stars in the bulge in the literature. We find that with the exception of scandium, all three stars follow the abundance trends identified previously for metal-poor halo stars. These three stars have the lowest [Sc II/Fe] abundances yet seen in $\alpha$-enhanced giant stars in the Galaxy. Moreover, all three stars are outliers in the otherwise tight [Sc II/Fe]-[Ti II/Fe] relation observed among metal-poor halo stars. Theoretical models predict that there is a 30% chance that at least one of these stars formed at $z\gtrsim15$, while there is a 70% chance that at least one formed at $10 \lesssim z \lesssim 15$. These observations imply that by $z\sim10$, the progenitor galaxies of the Milky Way had both reached [Fe/H] $\sim-3.0$ and established the abundance pattern observed in extremely metal-poor stars. "
"We discuss recent developments in the formulation of a Statistical Mechanics approach to non thermal systems, such as granular media. We review a few important numerical results on the assessment of Edwards' theory and, in particular, we apply these ideas to study a mean field model of a hard sphere binary mixture under gravity, which can be fully analytically investigated. As a consequence, we derive the rich phase diagram and predict the features of segregation patterns of the mixture. "
"Non-relativistic bound state theories for QED and QCD have become fairly mature and amenable to a textbook-level understanding and computation. In this talk we give an introductory review of the following subjects related to the recent computation of the heavy quarkonium spectrum using perturbative QCD: (1) Technological developments in higher-order computation, (2) Physics predictions, (3) Challenge towards analytic evaluation of the 3-loop static QCD potential.

"We regret that PRL did not accept our Reply for publication. We believe that both our Reply and the original paper (Phys. Rev. Lett. 118, 135901 (2017)) is sound and correct. We post our reply here and let readers to judge. "
"It is well known that, when an external general relativistic (electric-type) tidal field E(t) interacts with the evolving quadrupole moment I(t) of an isolated body, the tidal field does work on the body (``tidal work'') -- i.e., it transfers energy to the body -- at a rate given by the same formula as in Newtonian theory: dW/dt = -1/2 E dI/dt. Thorne has posed the following question: In view of the fact that the gravitational interaction energy between the tidal field and the body is ambiguous by an amount of order E(t)I(t), is the tidal work also ambiguous by this amount, and therefore is the formula dW/dt = -1/2 E dI/dt only valid unambiguously when integrated over timescales long compared to that for I(t) to change substantially? This paper completes a demonstration that the answer is no; dW/dt is not ambiguous in this way. More specifically, this paper shows that dW/dt is unambiguously given by -1/2 E dI/dt independently of one's choice of how to localize gravitational energy in general relativity. This is proved by explicitly computing dW/dt using various gravitational stress-energy pseudotensors (Einstein, Landau-Lifshitz, Moller) as well as Bergmann's conserved quantities which generalize many of the pseudotensors to include an arbitrary function of position. A discussion is also given of the problem of formulating conservation laws in general relativity and the role played by the various pseudotensors. "
"Lasers have revolutionized optical science and technology, but their microwave counterpart, maser, has not realized its great potential due to its demanding work conditions (high-vacuum for gas maser and liquid-helium temperature for solid-state maser). Room-temperature solid-state maser is highly desirable, but under such conditions the lifetimes of emitters (usually electron spins) are usually too short (~ns) for population inversion. The only room-temperature solid-state maser is based on a pentacene-doped p-terphenyl crystal, which has long spin lifetime (~0.1 ms). This maser, however, operates only in the pulse mode and the material is unstable. Here we propose room-temperature maser based on nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centres in diamond, which feature long spin lifetimes at room temperature (~10 ms), high optical pump efficiency, and material stability. We demonstrate that under readily accessible conditions, room-temperature diamond maser is feasible. Room-temperature diamond maser may facilitate a broad range of microwave technologies. "
We describe an efficient FPGA implementation for the exponentiation of large matrices. The research is related to an algorithm for constructing uniformly distributed linear recurring sequences. The design utilizes the special properties of both the FPGA and the used matrices to achieve a very significant speedup compared to traditional architectures.
"The finite-size spectrum for the multi-channel Kondo model is derived analytically from the exact solution, by mapping the nontrivial Z$_{n}$ part of the Kondo scattering into that for the RSOS model coupled with the impurity. The analysis is performed for the case of $n-2S=1$, where $n$ is the number of channel and $S$ is the impurity spin. The result obtained is in accordance with the Kac-Moody fusion hypothesis proposed by Affleck and Ludwig. "
"We present a novel method for high detail-preserving human avatar creation from monocular video. A parameterized body model is refined and optimized to maximally resemble subjects from a video showing them from all sides. Our avatars feature a natural face, hairstyle, clothes with garment wrinkles, and high-resolution texture. Our paper contributes facial landmark and shading-based human body shape refinement, a semantic texture prior, and a novel texture stitching strategy, resulting in the most sophisticated-looking human avatars obtained from a single video to date. Numerous results show the robustness and versatility of our method. A user study illustrates its superiority over the state-of-the-art in terms of identity preservation, level of detail, realism, and overall user preference. "
"Given a sequence of observations from a discrete-time, finite-state hidden Markov model, we would like to estimate the sampling distribution of a statistic. The bootstrap method is employed to approximate the confidence regions of a multi-dimensional parameter. We propose an importance sampling formula for efficient simulation in this context. Our approach consists of constructing a locally asymptotically normal (LAN) family of probability distributions around the default resampling rule and then minimizing the asymptotic variance within the LAN family. The solution of this minimization problem characterizes the asymptotically optimal resampling scheme, which is given by a tilting formula. The implementation of the tilting formula is facilitated by solving a Poisson equation. A few numerical examples are given to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed importance sampling scheme. "
"This paper details the implementation of a software framework that aids the development of distributed and self-configurable software systems. This framework is an instance of a novel integration strategy called SoSAA (SOcially Situated Agent Architecture), which combines Component-Based Software Engineering and Agent-Oriented Software Engineering, drawing its inspiration from hybrid agent control architectures. The framework defines a complete construction process by enhancing a simple component-based framework with reasoning and self-awareness capabilities through a standardized interface. The capabilities of the resulting framework are demonstrated through its application to a non-trivial Multi Agent System (MAS). The system in question is a pre-existing Information Retrieval (IR) system that has not previously taken advantage of CBSE principles. In this paper we contrast these two systems so as to highlight the benefits of using this new hybrid approach. We also outline how component-based elements may be integrated into the Agent Factory agent-oriented application framework. "
"The study of QCD at finite baryon density is severely hampered by the so-called fermion sign problem. As a result, we have no known first principles approach to study nuclear matter, or neutron stars from QCD. On the surface, the large Nc limit does not seem to simplify matters. In this limit, however, one can exploit dualities that exist between strongly coupled gauge theories. Our focus will be on some rather novel orbifold equivalences that have recently been discovered at finite density. These equivalences relate strongly coupled theories plagued by a sign problem, to strongly coupled theories free of sign problems. As a result, such dualities give deeper insight into the nature of the sign problem and possibly provide a way to simulate QCD at finite density in the large Nc limit. "
We report new results for the elemental and isotopic abundances of the normally rare elements mercury and platinum in HgMn stars. Typical overabundances can be 4 dex or more. The isotopic patterns do not follow the fractionation model of White et al (1976).
"White dwarfs are well studied objects. The relative simplicity of their physics allows to obtain very detailed models which can be ultimately compared with their observed properties. Among white dwarfs there is a specific class of stars, known as ZZ-Ceti objects, which have a hydrogen-rich envelope and show periodic variations in their light curves. G117-B15A belongs to this particular set of stars. The luminosity variations have been successfully explained as due to g-mode pulsations. G117-B15A has been recently claimed to be the most stable optical clock ever found, being the rate of change of its 215.2 s period very small: \dot{P}= (2.3 +- 1.4)x10^{-15} s s^-1, with a stability comparable to that of the most stable millisecond pulsars. The rate of change of the period is closely related to its cooling timescale, which can be accurately computed. In this paper we study the pulsational properties of G117-B15A and we use the observed rate of change of the period to impose constraints on the axion emissivity and, thus, to obtain a preliminary upper bound to the mass of the axion. This upper bound turns out to be 4cos^{2}{\beta} meV at the 95% confidence level. Although there are still several observational and theoretical uncertainties, we conclude that G117-B15A is a very promising stellar object to set up constraints on particle physics. "
"In the MSSM scalar h,H production is mediated by heavy quark and squark loops. The higher order QCD corrections have been obtained some time ago and turned out to be large. The full SUSY QCD corrections have been obained recently including the full mass dependence of the loop particles. We describe our calculation and present first numerical results. We also address the question of the proper treatment of the large gluino mass limit, i.e. the consistent decoupling of heavy gluino effects, and present the effective Lagrangian for decoupled gluinos. "
"Modern cosmological observations allow us to study in great detail the evolution and history of the large scale structure hierarchy. The fundamental problem of accurate constraints on the cosmological parameters, within a given cosmological model, requires precise modelling of the observed structure. In this paper we briefly review the current most effective techniques of large scale structure simulations, emphasising both their advantages and shortcomings. Starting with basics of the direct N-body simulations appropriate to modelling cold dark matter evolution, we then discuss the direct-sum technique GRAPE, particle-mesh (PM) and hybrid methods, combining the PM and the tree algorithms. Simulations of baryonic matter in the Universe often use hydrodynamic codes based on both particle methods that discretise mass, and grid-based methods. We briefly describe Eulerian grid methods, and also some variants of Lagrangian smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) methods. "
"Let Lag(E) be the grassmannian of lagrangian subspaces of a complex symplectic vector space E. We construct a Maslov class which generates the second integral cohomology of Lag(E), and we show that its mod 2 reduction is the characteristic class of a flat gerbe with structure group Z_2. We explain the relation of this gerbe to the well-known flat Maslov line bundle with structure group Z_4 over the real lagrangian grassmannian, whose characteristic class is the mod 4 reduction of the real Maslov class. "
"Inverse electromagnetic design has emerged as a way of efficiently designing active and passive electromagnetic devices. This maturing strategy involves optimizing the shape or topology of a device in order to improve a figure of merit--a process which is typically performed using some form of steepest descent algorithm. Naturally, this requires that we compute the gradient of a figure of merit which describes device performance, potentially with respect to many design variables. In this paper, we introduce a new strategy based on smoothing abrupt material interfaces which enables us to efficiently compute these gradients with high accuracy irrespective of the resolution of the underlying simulation. This has advantages over previous approaches to shape and topology optimization in nanophotonics which are either prone to gradient errors or place important constraints on the shape of the device. As a demonstration of this new strategy, we optimize a non-adiabatic waveguide taper between a narrow and wide waveguide. This optimization leads to a non-intuitive design with a very low insertion loss of only 0.041 dB at 1550 nm. "
"We present a sequent calculus for the Grzegorczyk modal logic Grz allowing cyclic and other non-well-founded proofs and obtain the cut-elimination theorem for it by constructing a continuous cut-elimination mapping acting on these proofs. As an application, we establish the Lyndon interpolation property for the logic Grz proof-theoretically. "
"We propose a scalable video broadcasting scheme over MIMO-OFDM systems. The scalable video source layers are channel encoded and modulated into independent signal streams, which are then transmitted from the allocated antennas in certain time-frequency blocks. Each receiver employs the successive group decoder to decode the signal streams of interest by treating other signal streams as interference. The transmitter performs adaptive coding and modulation, and transmission antenna and subcarrier allocation, based on the rate feedback from the receivers. We also propose a hybrid receiver that switches between the successive group decoder and the MMSE decoder depending on the rate. Extensive simulations are provided to demonstrate the performance gain of the proposed group-decoding-based scalable video broadcasting scheme over the one based on the conventional MMSE decoding. "
"Recent results on solar neutrinos provide hints that the LMA MSW solution could be correct. We perform accurate calculations for potential `smoking-gun' effects of the LMA solution in the SuperKamiokande solar neutrino experiment, including: (1) an almost constant reduction of the standard recoil electron energy spectrum (with a weak, < 10%, relative increase below 6.5 MeV); (2) an integrated difference in day-night rates (2% to 14%); (3) an approximately constant zenith-angle dependence of the nighttime event rate; (4) a new test for the difference in the shape of the equally-normalized day-night energy spectra (~ 1%); and (5) annual variations of the signal due to the regeneration effect (~ 6 times smaller than the integrated day-night effect). We also establish a relation between the integrated day-night asymmetry and the seasonal asymmetry due to LMA regeneration. As a cautionary example, we simulate the effect of an absolute energy calibration error on the shape (distortion) of the recoil energy spectrum. We compare LMA predictions with SuperKamiokande data and discuss the possibilities for distinguishing experimentally between LMA and vacuum oscillations. "
"In this work, we discuss certain ballistic random walks in random environments on $\mathbb{Z}^d$, and prove the equivalence between the static and dynamic points of view in dimension $d\geq4$. Using this equivalence, we also prove a version of a local limit theorem which relates the local behavior of the quenched and annealed measures of the random walk by a prefactor. "
The problem of extraction of a single-mode quantum state from a high-Q cavity is studied for the case in which the time of preparation of the quantum state of the cavity mode is short compared with its decay time. The temporal evolution of the quantum state of the field escaping from the cavity is calculated in terms of phase-space functions. A general condition is derived under which the quantum state of the pulse built up outside the cavity is a nearly perfect copy of the quantum state the cavity field was initially prepared in. The results show that unwanted losses prevent the realization of a nearly perfect extraction of nonclassical quantum states from high-Q optical microcavities with presently available technology.
Binding energy of eta_c with ^4 He has been calculated on the basis of Yukawa type potential. Final Rank Approximation (FRA) has been used for microscopical treatment of the initial 5-body problem. The results are compared with the results of the folding model and variational calculations.
"A very simple way to obtain comparable baryon and DM densities in the early Universe is through their contemporary production from the out-of-equilibrium decay of a mother particle, if both populations are suppressed by comparably small numbers, i.e. the CP violation in the decay and the branching fraction respectively. We present a detailed study of this kind of scenario in the context of a R-parity violating realization of the MSSM in which the baryon asymmetry and the gravitino Dark Matter are produced by the decay of a Bino. The implementation of this simple picture in a realistic particle framework results, however, quite involving, due to the non trivial determination of the abundance of the decaying Bino, as well as due to the impact of wash-out processes and of additional sources both for the baryon asymmetry and the DM relic density. In order to achieve a quantitative determination of the baryon and Dark Matter abundances, we have implemented and solved a system of coupled Boltzmann equations for the particle species involved in their generation, including all the relevant processes. In the most simple, but still general, limit, in which the processes determining the abundance and the decay rate of the Bino are mediated by degenerate right-handed squarks, the correct values of the DM and baryon relic densities are achieved for a Bino mass between 50 and 100 TeV, Gluino NLSP mass in the range 15-60 TeV and a gravitino mass between 100 GeV and few TeV. These high masses are unfortunately beyond the kinematical reach of LHC. On the contrary, an antiproton signal from the decays of the gravitino LSP might be within the sensitivity of AMS-02 and gamma-ray telescopes. "
"In this paper we extend some existence's results concerning the generalized eigenvalues for fully nonlinear operators singular or degenerate. We consider the radial case and we prove the existence of an infinite number of eigenvalues, simple and isolated. This completes the results obtained by the author with Isabeau Birindelli for the first eigenvalues in the radial case, and the results obtained for the Pucci's operator by Busca Esteban and Quaas and for the $p$-Laplace operator by Del Pino and Manasevich. "
"No analytic solution is known to date for a black hole in a compact dimension. We develop an analytic perturbation theory where the small parameter is the size of the black hole relative to the size of the compact dimension. We set up a general procedure for an arbitrary order in the perturbation series based on an asymptotic matched expansion between two coordinate patches: the near horizon zone and the asymptotic zone. The procedure is ordinary perturbation expansion in each zone, where additionally some boundary data comes from the other zone, and so the procedure alternates between the zones. It can be viewed as a dialogue of multipoles where the black hole changes its shape (mass multipoles) in response to the field (multipoles) created by its periodic ""mirrors"", and that in turn changes its field and so on. We present the leading correction to the full metric including the first correction to the area-temperature relation, the leading term for black hole eccentricity and the ""Archimedes effect"". The next order corrections will appear in a sequel. On the way we determine independently the static perturbations of the Schwarzschild black hole in dimension d>=5, where the system of equations can be reduced to ""a master equation"" - a single ordinary differential equation. The solutions are hypergeometric functions which in some cases reduce to polynomials. "
"With any max-stable random process $\eta$ on $\mathcal{X}=\mathbb{Z}^d$ or $\mathbb{R}^d$, we associate a random tessellation of the parameter space $\mathcal{X}$. The construction relies on the Poisson point process representation of the max-stable process $\eta$ which is seen as the pointwise maximum of a random collection of functions $\Phi=\{\phi\_i, i\geq 1\}$. The tessellation is constructed as follows: two points $x,y\in \mathcal{X}$ are in the same cell if and only if there exists a function $\phi\in\Phi$ that realizes the maximum $\eta$ at both points $x$ and $y$, i.e. $\phi(x)=\eta(x)$ and $\phi(y)=\eta(y)$. We characterize the distribution of cells in terms of coverage and inclusion probabilities. Most interesting is the stationary case where the asymptotic properties of the cells are strongly related to the ergodic properties of the non-singular flow generating the max-stable process. For example, we show that: i) the cells are bounded almost surely if and only if $\eta$ is generated by a dissipative flow, ii) the cells have positive asymptotic density almost surely if and only if $\eta$ is generated by a positive flow. "
"We investigate the morphology of quasi-free-standing monolayer graphene (QFMLG) formed at several temperatures by hydrogen intercalation and discuss its relationship with transport properties. Features corresponding to incomplete hydrogen intercalation at the graphene-substrate interface are observed by scanning tunneling microscopy on QFMLG formed at 600 and 800{\deg}C. They contribute to carrier scattering as charged impurities. Voids in the SiC substrate and wrinkling of graphene appear at 1000{\deg}C, and they decrease the carrier mobility significantly. "
"We study the combinatorial and rigidity properties of disk packings with generic radii. We show that a packing of $n$ disks in the plane with generic radii cannot have more than $2n-3$ pairs of disks in contact. The allowed motions of a packing preserve the disjointness of the disk interiors and tangency between pairs already in contact (modeling a collection of sticky disks). We show that if a packing has generic radii, then the allowed motions are all rigid body motions if and only if the packing has exactly $2n-3$ contacts. Our approach is to study the space of packings with a fixed contact graph. The main technical step is to show that this space is a smooth manifold, which is done via a connection to the Cauchy-Alexandrov stress lemma. Our methods also apply to jamming problems, in which contacts are allowed to break during a motion. We give a simple proof of a finite variant of a recent result of Connelly, et al. on the number of contacts in a jammed packing of disks with generic radii. "
In this paper we tried to condense the determinant of n square matrix to the determinant of (n - 1) square matrix with the mathematical proof.
"Using adjoint representation of Lie superalgebras, we obtain the matrix form of super-Jacobi and mixed super-Jacobi identities of Lie superbialgebras. By direct calculations of these identities, and use of automorphism supergroups of two and three dimensional Lie superalgebras, we obtain and classify all two and three dimensional Lie superbialgebras.

"We construct algebro-geometric upper triangular solutions of rank two Schlesinger systems. Using these solutions we derive two families of solutions to the sixth Painlev\'e equation with parameters $({1}/{8}, -{1}/{8}, {1}/{8}, {3}/{8})$ expressed in simple forms using periods of differentials on elliptic curves. Similarly for every integer $n$ different from $0$ and $-1$ we obtain one family of solutions to the sixth Painlev\'e equation with parameters $(\frac{9n^2+12n+4}{8}, -\frac{n^2}{8}, \frac{n^2}{8}, \frac{4-n^2}{8})$.

"We discuss bi-Hamiltonian structures for integrable and superintegrable Hamiltonian system on the list of symplectic four-dimensional real Lie groups are classified by G. Ovando. In addition, we creat corresponding control matrix for obtained bi-Hamiltonian structures. "
"In this paper, we demonstrate how the interpretation of quantum mechanics due to Land\'e resolves the Schr\""odinger cat paradox and disposes of the problem of wave function collapse. "
"We present photometry for all bright red giant branch (RGB), horizontal branch (HB), and asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars within 10' of the center of M13. We find support for the idea that the population of HB stars redder than the primary group are noticeably evolved, which resolves a disagreement between distance moduli derived from the tip of the RGB and from stars near the instability strip. The sharp cut at the red end of the HB provides strong evidence that stars from the dominant HB group must still be undergoing blue loops, implying that diffusion is being inhibited. We argue that M13's HB is a somewhat pathological case - the dominant HB population occurs very near the ""knee"" in optical CMDs, and evolved stars exclusively appear redward of that peak, leading to the incorrect appearance of a continuation of the unevolved HB. M13 has a distinct group of HB stars previously identified with the second U jump, which may be examples of early hot flashers that ignite core helium fusion shortly after leaving the RGB. However, there is not convincing evidence that a large fraction of stars leave the RGB before helium flash. We revisited the helium-sensitive R ratio, and find that M13's ratio is in agreement with theoretical values for primordial helium abundance Y_P = 0.245 and inconsistent with a helium enhancement DY = 0.04. The brightness of the HB (both in comparison to the end of the canonical HB and to the tip of the RGB) also appears to rule out the idea that the envelopes of the reddest HB stars have been significantly enriched in helium. The absolute colors of the turnoffs of M3 and M13 may potentially be used to look for differences in their mean helium abundances.(ABRIDGED) "
"In this note we give some sufficient conditions for an analytic function $f(z)$ normalized by $f'(0)=1$ to belong to certain subfamilies of the class of Bazilevic functions. In earlier works, the closure property of many classes of functions under the Bernardi integral have been considered. The converse of this problem is also considered here. "
This paper deals with how to extract the s-s(bar) contribution to the proton magnetic moment from the experiments
"The amount $Q$ of particles that are transported via a path of motion is characterized by its expectation value $<Q>$ and by its variance $Var(Q)$. We analyze what happens if a particle has two optional paths available to get from one site to another site, and in particular what is $Var(Q)$ for the current which is induced in a quantum stirring device. It turns out that coherent splitting and the stirring effect are intimately related and cannot be understood within the framework of the prevailing probabilistic theory. "
"In this paper, we address the challenge of land use and land cover classification using Sentinel-2 satellite images. The Sentinel-2 satellite images are openly and freely accessible provided in the Earth observation program Copernicus. We present a novel dataset based on Sentinel-2 satellite images covering 13 spectral bands and consisting out of 10 classes with in total 27,000 labeled and geo-referenced images. We provide benchmarks for this novel dataset with its spectral bands using state-of-the-art deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNNs). With the proposed novel dataset, we achieved an overall classification accuracy of 98.57%. The resulting classification system opens a gate towards a number of Earth observation applications. We demonstrate how this classification system can be used for detecting land use and land cover changes and how it can assist in improving geographical maps. The geo-referenced dataset EuroSAT is made publicly available at https://github.com/phelber/eurosat. "
"In the context of a typical model for fermion mass matrices, possibly based on the horizontal U(2) symmetry, we explore the effect of the type II seesaw mechanism on lepton mixings. We find that the combined contribution of type I and type II terms is able to explain the large but not maximal 1-2 mixing and the near maximal 2-3 mixing, while the 1-3 mixing angle is predicted to be small. "
"We prove the equivalence between non-local gravity with an arbitrary form factor and a non-local gravitational system with an extra rank-2 symmetric tensor. Thanks to this reformulation, we use the diffusion-equation method to transform the dynamics of renormalizable non-local gravity with exponential operators into a higher-dimensional system local in spacetime coordinates. This method, first illustrated with a scalar field theory and then applied to gravity, allows one to solve the Cauchy problem and count the number of initial conditions and of non-perturbative degrees of freedom, which is finite. In particular, the non-local scalar and gravitational theories with exponential operators are characterized by, respectively, two and four initial conditions in any dimension and, respectively, by one and eight degrees of freedom in four dimensions. The fully covariant equations of motion are written in a form convenient to find analytic non-perturbative solutions. "
"After the incredible success of deep learning in the computer vision domain, there has been much interest in applying Convolutional Network (ConvNet) features in robotic fields such as visual navigation and SLAM. Unfortunately, there are fundamental differences and challenges involved. Computer vision datasets are very different in character to robotic camera data, real-time performance is essential, and performance priorities can be different. This paper comprehensively evaluates and compares the utility of three state-of-the-art ConvNets on the problems of particular relevance to navigation for robots; viewpoint-invariance and condition-invariance, and for the first time enables real-time place recognition performance using ConvNets with large maps by integrating a variety of existing (locality-sensitive hashing) and novel (semantic search space partitioning) optimization techniques. We present extensive experiments on four real world datasets cultivated to evaluate each of the specific challenges in place recognition. The results demonstrate that speed-ups of two orders of magnitude can be achieved with minimal accuracy degradation, enabling real-time performance. We confirm that networks trained for semantic place categorization also perform better at (specific) place recognition when faced with severe appearance changes and provide a reference for which networks and layers are optimal for different aspects of the place recognition problem. "
"We develop a quantitative version of Aubry duality and use it to obtain several sharp estimates for the dynamics of Schr\""odinger cocycles associated to a non-perturbatively small analytic potential and Diophantine frequency. In particular, we establish the full version of Eliasson's reducibility theory in this regime (our approach actually leads to improvements even in the perturbative regime: we are able to show, for all energies, ``almost reducibility'' in some band of analyticity). We also prove 1/2-H\""older continuity of the integrated density of states. For the almost Mathieu operator, our results hold through the entire regime of sub-critical coupling and imply also the dry version of the Ten Martini Problem for the concerned parameters. "
"The decay widths of the quantum black hole precursors, determined from the poles of the resummed graviton propagator, are matched to the expected lifetime given by the Hawking decay. In this way, we impose a sort of duality between a perturbative description and an essentially non-perturbative description, bearing some similarity with the Bloom-Gilman duality for the strong interactions. General relations are then obtained for the widths and masses of the poles in terms of the number of particle species and the renormalisation scale of gravity. "
We study the decay of high spin mesons using the gauge/string theory correspondence. The rate of the process is calculated by studying the splitting of a macroscopic string intersecting a D-brane. The result is applied to the decay of mesons in N=4 SYM with a small number of flavors and in a gravity dual of large N QCD. In QCD the decay of high spin mesons is found to be heavily suppressed in the regime of validity of the supergravity description.
"Data provenance describes how data came to be in its present form. It includes data sources and the transformations that have been applied to them. Data provenance has many uses, from forensics and security to aiding the reproducibility of scientific experiments. We present CamFlow, a whole-system provenance capture mechanism that integrates easily into a PaaS offering. While there have been several prior whole-system provenance systems that captured a comprehensive, systemic and ubiquitous record of a system's behavior, none have been widely adopted. They either A) impose too much overhead, B) are designed for long-outdated kernel releases and are hard to port to current systems, C) generate too much data, or D) are designed for a single system. CamFlow addresses these shortcoming by: 1) leveraging the latest kernel design advances to achieve efficiency; 2) using a self-contained, easily maintainable implementation relying on a Linux Security Module, NetFilter, and other existing kernel facilities; 3) providing a mechanism to tailor the captured provenance data to the needs of the application; and 4) making it easy to integrate provenance across distributed systems. The provenance we capture is streamed and consumed by tenant-built auditor applications. We illustrate the usability of our implementation by describing three such applications: demonstrating compliance with data regulations; performing fault/intrusion detection; and implementing data loss prevention. We also show how CamFlow can be leveraged to capture meaningful provenance without modifying existing applications. "
"The Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA) project, led by an international collaboration of institutes, aims to create the world's largest next generation observatory for Very High Energy (VHE) gamma-ray astronomy. It will be devoted to observations in a wide band of energy, from a few tens of GeV to a few hundreds of TeV with Large, Medium and Small-sized telescopes. The Small-Size Telescopes (SSTs) are dedicated to the highest energy range above a few TeV and up to 300 TeV. GCT is an imaging atmospheric Cherenkov telescope (IACT) proposed for the subarray of about 70 SSTs to be installed on the Southern site of CTA in Chile. The Observatory of Paris and the National Institute for Earth Sciences and Astronomy (INSU/CNRS) have developed the mechanical structure, mirrors (aspherical lightweight aluminium segments) and control system of the GCT. The GCT is based on a Schwarzschild- Couder (S-C) dual-mirror optical design which has the advantages, compared to the current IACTs, to offer a wide field of view (~ 9{\deg}) while decreasing the cost and volume (~ 9 m x 4 m x 6 m for ~ 11 tons) of the telescope structure, as well as the camera. The prototype (pGCT) has been installed at the Meudon's site of the Observatory of Paris and was the first S-C telescope and the first CTA prototype to record VHE events on-sky in November 2015. After three years of intensive testing, pGCT has now been commissioned. This paper is a status report on the complete GCT telescope optical system and the performance it can provide for CTA. "
"The extensive penetration of wind farms (WFs) presents challenges to the operation of distribution networks (DNs). Building a probability distribution of the aggregated wind power forecast error is of great value for decision making. However, as a result of recent government incentives, many WFs are being newly built with little historical data for training distribution models. Moreover, WFs with different stakeholders may refuse to submit the raw data to a data center for model training. To address these problems, a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) is applied to build the distribution of the aggregated wind power forecast error; then, the maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation method is adopted to overcome the limited training data problem in GMM parameter estimation. Next, a distributed MAP estimation method is developed based on the average consensus filter algorithm to address the data privacy issue. The distribution control center is introduced into the distributed estimation process to acquire more precise estimation results and better adapt to the DN control architecture. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is empirically verified using historical data. "
"This paper establishes the existence of equilibrium result of a class of mean field games with singular controls, which arise in optimal portfolio liquidation and optimal exploitation of exhaustible resource. The interaction is through both states and controls. A relaxed solution approach is used. We prove the existence of equilibria by first considering the corresponding mean field games with continuous controls instead of singular controls and then taking approximation. "
"For the description of the Universe expansion, compatible with observational data, a model of modified gravity - Lovelock gravity with dilaton - is investigated. D-dimensional space with 3- and (D-4)-dimensional maximally symmetric subspaces is considered. Space without matter and space with perfect fluid are under test. In various forms of the theory under way (third order without dilaton and second order - Einstein-Gauss-Bonnet gravity - with dilaton and without it) stationary, power-law, exponential and exponent-of-exponent form cosmological solutions are obtained. Last two forms include solutions which are clear to describe accelerating expansion of 3-dimensional subspace. Also there is a set of solutions describing cosmological expansion which does not tend to isotropization in the presence of matter. "
"We study the Hamilton-Jacobi and massive Klein-Gordon equations in the general Kerr-(Anti) de Sitter black hole background in all dimensions. Complete separation of both equations is carried out in cases when there are two sets of equal black hole rotation parameters. We analyze explicitly the symmetry properties of these backgrounds that allow for this Liouville integrability and construct a nontrivial irreducible Killing tensor associated with the enlarged symmetry group which permits separation. We also derive first-order equations of motion for particles in these backgrounds and examine some of their properties. This work greatly generalizes previously known results for both the Myers-Perry metrics, and the Kerr-(Anti) de Sitter metrics in higher dimensions. "
"The asymmetric Hopfield model is used to simulate signaling dynamics in gene/transcription factor networks. The model allows for a direct mapping of a gene expression pattern into attractor states. We analyze different control strategies aiming at disrupting attractor patterns using selective local fields representing therapeutic interventions. The control strategies are based on the identification of signaling $bottlenecks$, which are single nodes or strongly connected clusters of nodes that have a large impact on the signaling. We provide a theorem with bounds on the minimum number of nodes that guarantee controllability of bottlenecks consisting of strongly connected components. The control strategies are applied to the identification of sets of proteins that, when inhibited, selectively disrupt the signaling of cancer cells while preserving the signaling of normal cells. We use an experimentally validated non-specific network and a specific B cell interactome reconstructed from gene expression data to model cancer signaling in lung and B cells, respectively. This model could help in the rational design of novel robust therapeutic interventions based on our increasing knowledge of complex gene signaling networks. "
Temperature dependence of pion and sigma-meson screening masses is evaluated by the Polyakov-loop extended Nambu--Jona-Lasinio (PNJL) model with the entanglement vertex. We propose a practical way of calculating meson screening masses in the NJL-type effective models. The method based on the Pauli-Villars regularization solves the well-known difficulty that the evaluaton of screening masses is not easy in the NJL-type effective models.The PNJL model with the entanglement vertex and the Pauli-Villars regularization well reproduces lattice QCD results on temperature dependence of the chiral condensate and the Polyakov loop. The method is applied to analyze temperature dependence of pion screening mass calculated with state-of-the-art lattice simulations with success in reproducing the lattice QCD results.
"We study semileptonic and radiative B decays involving the strange tensor meson K_2^*(1430) in the final state. Using the large energy effective theory (LEET) techniques, we formulate the B \to K_2^* transition form factors in large recoil region. All the form factors can be parametrized in terms of two independent LEET parameters \zeta_\perp and \zeta_\parallel. The magnitude of \zeta_\perp is estimated from the data for Br(B \to K_2^*(1430)\gamma). Assuming a dipole q^2-dependence for the LEET parameters and \zeta_\parallel/\zeta_\perp = 1.0 \pm 0.2, we investigate the decays B \to K_2^* \ell^+ \ell^- and B \to K_2^* \nu \bar{\nu}, where the contributions due to $\zeta_\parallel are suppressed by m_{K_2^*}/m_B. For the B \to K_2^* \ell^+ \ell^- decay, in the large recoil region where the hadronic uncertainties are considerably reduced, the longitudinal distribution d F_L/ds is reduced by 20-30 % due to the flipped sign of c_7^eff compared with the standard model result. Moreover, the forward-backward asymmetry zero is about 3.4 GeV^2 in the standard model, but changing the sign of c_7^eff yields a positive asymmetry for all values of the invariant mass of the lepton pair. We calculate the branching fraction for B \to K_2^* \nu \bar{\nu} in the standard model. Our result exhibits the impressed resemblance between B \to K_2^*(1430) \ell^+\ell^-, \nu \bar{\nu} and B \to K^*(892) \ell^+ \ell^-, \nu\bar{\nu}. "
We show that a congruence discovered by George E. Andrews in 1969 for the Fibonacci quotient directly implies a simpler congruence found by Hugh C. Williams in 1991.
"In this work, we generalise linear magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) stability theory to include equilibrium pressure anisotropy in the fluid part of the analysis. A novel 'single-adiabatic' (SA) fluid closure is presented which is complementary to the usual 'double-adiabatic' (CGL) model and has the advantage of naturally reproducing exactly the MHD spectrum in the isotropic limit. As with MHD and CGL, the SA model neglects the anisotropic perturbed pressure and thus loses non-local fast-particle stabilisation present in the kinetic approach. Another interesting aspect of this new approach is that the stabilising terms appear naturally as separate viscous corrections leaving the isotropic SA closure unchanged. After verifying the self-consistency of the SA model, we re-derive the projected linear MHD set of equations required for stability analysis of tokamaks in the MISHKA code. The cylindrical wave equation is derived analytically as done previously in the spectral theory of MHD and clear predictions are made for the modification to fast-magnetosonic and slow ion sound speeds due to equilibrium anisotropy. "
"The elimination of extrinsic sources of spin relaxation is key in realizing the exceptional intrinsic spin transport performance of graphene. Towards this, we study charge and spin transport in bilayer graphene-based spin valve devices fabricated in a new device architecture which allows us to make a comparative study by separately investigating the roles of substrate and polymer residues on spin relaxation. First, the comparison between spin valves fabricated on SiO2 and BN substrates suggests that substrate-related charged impurities, phonons and roughness do not limit the spin transport in current devices. Next, the observation of a 5-fold enhancement in spin relaxation time in the encapsulated device highlights the significance of polymer residues on spin relaxation. We observe a spin relaxation length of ~ 10 um in the encapsulated bilayer with a charge mobility of 24000 cm2/Vs. The carrier density dependence of spin relaxation time has two distinct regimes; n<4 x 1012 cm-2, where spin relaxation time decreases monotonically as carrier concentration increases, and n>4 x 1012 cm-2, where spin relaxation time exhibits a sudden increase. The sudden increase in the spin relaxation time with no corresponding signature in the charge transport suggests the presence of a magnetic resonance close to the charge neutrality point. We also demonstrate, for the first time, spin transport across bipolar p-n junctions in our dual-gated device architecture that fully integrates a sequence of encapsulated regions in its design. At low temperatures, strong suppression of the spin signal was observed while a transport gap was induced, which is interpreted as a novel manifestation of impedance mismatch within the spin channel. "
"By using the integral method in the muon propagation through water, we calculate the range fluctuation of high and ultra high energy muons. Many authors divide all radiative processes into two parts, namely, the continuous part and radiative part in their Monte Carlo simulation in order to consider the fluctuation in the both ranges and energies of the muons, while we treat all stochastic processes as exactly as possible, without the introduction of the continuous parts in all stochastic processes. The validity of our Monte Carlo method is checked by the corresponding analytical method which is methodologically independent on the Monte Carlo procedure. Accompanied cascade showers are generated by the direct electron pair production, bremsstrahlung and photo-nuclear interaction. These showers are calculated by the exact Monte Carlo Method in one dimensional way. We report survival probabilities, range distributions and examples of individual muon behavior. "
"We calculate the ""pi Sigma Lambda"" and ""pi Sigma Sigma"" coupling constants in light cone QCD sum rules for the structure ""sigma_{alpha beta} gamma_5 p^alpha q^beta"". A comparison of our results on these coupling constants with prediction of the SU(3) symmetry is presented. "
"The COMPASS collaboration published precise data on production cross section of charged hadrons in lepton-hadron semi-inclusive deep inelastic scattering, showing almost an order of magnitude larger than next-to-leading order QCD calculations when $P_{h_T}$ and $z_h$ are sufficiently large. We explore the role of power corrections to the theoretical calculations, and quantitatively demonstrate that the power corrections are extremely important for these data when the final-state multiplicity is low and the production kinematics is near the edge of phase space. Our finding motivates more detailed studies on power corrections for upcoming experiments at Jefferson Lab, as well as the future Electron-Ion Collider. "
"Current cone jet algorithms, widely used at hadron colliders, take event particles as seeds in an iterative search for stable cones. A longstanding infrared (IR) unsafety issue in such algorithms is often assumed to be solvable by adding extra `midpoint' seeds, but actually is just postponed to one order higher in the coupling. A proper solution is to switch to an exact seedless cone algorithm, one that provably identifies all stable cones. The only existing approach takes N 2^N time to find jets among N particles, making it unusable at hadron level. This can be reduced to N^2 ln(N) time, leading to code (SISCone) whose speed is similar to that of public midpoint implementations. Monte Carlo tests provide a strong cross-check of an analytical proof of the IR safety of the new algorithm, and the absence of any 'R_{sep}' issue implies a good practical correspondence between parton and hadron levels. Relative to a midpoint cone, the use of an IR safe seedless algorithm leads to modest changes for inclusive jet spectra, mostly through reduced sensitivity to the underlying event, and significant changes for some multi-jet observables. "
"In this article we study the second variation of the energy functional associated to the Allen-Cahn equation on closed manifolds. Extending well known analogies between the gradient theory of phase transitions and the theory of minimal hypersurfaces, we prove the upper semicontinuity of the eigenvalues of the stability operator and consequently obtain upper bounds for the Morse index of limit interfaces which arise from solutions with bounded energy and index without assuming any multiplicity or orientability condition on these hypersurfaces. This extends some recent results of N. Le and F. Hiesmayr. "
"The recently proposed effective potential theory [Phys. Rev. Lett. 110, 235001 (2013)] is used to investigate the influence of coupling on inter-ion-species diffusion and momentum exchange in multi-component plasmas. Thermo-diffusion and the thermal force are found to diminish rapidly as strong coupling onsets. For the same coupling parameters, the dynamic friction coefficient is found to tend to unity. These results provide an impetus for addressing the role of coupling on diffusive processes in inertial confinement fusion experiments. "
"Applications such as textual entailment, plagiarism detection or document clustering rely on the notion of semantic similarity, and are usually approached with dimension reduction techniques like LDA or with embedding-based neural approaches. We present a scenario where semantic similarity is not enough, and we devise a neural approach to learn semantic relatedness. The scenario is text spotting in the wild, where a text in an image (e.g. street sign, advertisement or bus destination) must be identified and recognized. Our goal is to improve the performance of vision systems by leveraging semantic information. Our rationale is that the text to be spotted is often related to the image context in which it appears (word pairs such as Delta-airplane, or quarters-parking are not similar, but are clearly related). We show how learning a word-to-word or word-to-sentence relatedness score can improve the performance of text spotting systems up to 2.9 points, outperforming other measures in a benchmark dataset. "
"We present new (3+1)D numerical relativity simulations of the binary neutron star (BNS) merger and postmerger phase. We focus on a previously inaccessible region of the binary parameter space spanning the binary's mass-ratio $q\sim1.00-1.75$ for different total masses and equations of state, and up to $q\sim2$ for a stiff BNS system. We study the mass-ratio effect on the gravitational waves (GWs) and on the possible electromagnetic emission associated to dynamical mass ejecta. We compute waveforms, spectra, and spectrograms of the GW strain including all the multipoles up to $l=4$. The mass-ratio has a specific imprint on the GW multipoles in the late-inspiral-merger signal, and it affects qualitatively the spectra of the merger remnant. The multipole effect is also studied by considering the dependency of the GW spectrograms on the source's sky location. Unequal mass BNSs produce more ejecta than equal mass systems with ejecta masses and kinetic energies depending almost linearly on $q$. We estimate luminosity peaks and light curves of macronovae events associated to the mergers using a simple approach. For $q\sim2$ the luminosity peak is delayed for several days and can be up to four times larger than for the $q=1$ cases. The macronova emission associated with the $q\sim2$ BNS is more persistent in time and could be observed for weeks instead of few days ($q=1$) in the near infrared. Finally, we estimate the flux of possible radio flares produced by the interaction of relativistic outflows with the surrounding medium. Also in this case a large $q$ can significantly enhance the emission and delay the peak luminosity. Overall, our results indicate that BNS merger with large mass ratio have EM signatures distinct from the equal mass case and more similar to black hole - neutron star binaries. "
"In this paper we examine the effect of X-ray and Lyalpha photons on the intergalactic medium temperature. We calculate the photon production from a population of stars and micro-quasars in a set of cosmological hydrodynamic simulations which self-consistently follow the dark matter dynamics, radiative processes as well as star formation, black hole growth and associated feedback processes. We find that, (i) IGM heating is always dominated by X-rays unless the Lyalpha photon contribution from stars in objects with mass M<10^8 Msun becomes significantly enhanced with respect to the X-ray contribution from BHs in the same halo (which we do not directly model). (ii) Without overproducing the unresolved X-ray background, the gas temperature becomes larger than the CMB temperature, and thus an associated 21 cm signal should be expected in emission, at z<11.5. We discuss how in such a scenario the transition redshift between a 21 cm signal in absorption and in emission could be used to constraint BHs accretion and associated feedback processes. "
"For a given graph G and integers b,f >= 0, let S be a subset of vertices of G of size b+1 such that the subgraph of G induced by S is connected and S can be separated from other vertices of G by removing f vertices. We prove that every graph on n vertices contains at most n\binom{b+f}{b} such vertex subsets. This result from extremal combinatorics appears to be very useful in the design of several enumeration and exact algorithms. In particular, we use it to provide algorithms that for a given n-vertex graph G - compute the treewidth of G in time O(1.7549^n) by making use of exponential space and in time O(2.6151^n) and polynomial space; - decide in time O(({\frac{2n+k+1}{3})^{k+1}\cdot kn^6}) if the treewidth of G is at most k; - list all minimal separators of G in time O(1.6181^n) and all potential maximal cliques of G in time O(1.7549^n). This significantly improves previous algorithms for these problems. "
"In a photoionization spectrum in which there is no excitation of the discrete states, but only the underlying continuum, we have observed resonances which appear as symmetric peaks, not the commonly expected window resonances. Furthermore, since the excitation to the unperturbed continuum vanishes, the cross section expected from Fano's configuration interaction theory is identically zero. This shortcoming is removed by the explicit introduction of the phase shifted continuum, which demonstrates that the shape of a resonance, by itself, provides no information about the relative excitation amplitudes to the discrete state and the continuum. "
"We present results of our intra-night optical flux monitoring observations of S5 0716+714 done simultaneously in gRI filters. The observations were done using Multicolor Imaging Telescopes for Survey and Monstrous Explosions (MITSuME) instrument on the 50 cm telescope at the Okayama Astrophysical Observatory over 30 nights between 11 March 2008 and 8 May 2008. Of these 30 nights, 22 nights have continuous (without any break) observations with duration ranging from 1 to 6 hours and hence were considered for intra-night optical variability (INOV). In total we have 4888 datapoints which were simultaneous in gR and I filters. Of the 22 nights considered for INOV, the object showed flux variability on 19 nights with the amplitude of variability in the I-band ranging from ~4% to ~55%. The duty cycle for INOV was thus found to be 83%. No time lag between different bands was noticed on most of the nights, except for 3 nights where the variation in g was found to lead that of the I band by 0.3 to 1.5 hrs. On inter-night timescales, no lag was found between g and I bands. On inter-night timescales as well as intra-night timescales on most of the nights, the amplitude of variability was found to increase toward shorter wavelengths. The flux variations in the different bands were not achromatic, with the blazar tending to become bluer when brighter both on inter-night and intra-night timescales; and this might be attributed to the larger amplitude variation at shorter wavelengths. A clear periodic variation of 3.3 hrs was found on 1 April 2008 and a hint for another possible periodic variability of 4 hrs was found on 31 March 2008. During our 30 days of observations over a 2 month period the source has varied with an amplitude of variability as large as ~80%. "
We improve our previous results for the percolation thresholds of isotropically oriented rods in three dimensional boxes. We prove again the applicability of the excluded volume rule in the slender-rod limit (radius/length -> 0). Other limits for the rod sizes are discussed and important finite-size effects are revealed.
This article describes a gradient complex network model whose weights are proportional to the difference between uniformly distributed ``fitness'' values assigned to the nodes. It is shown analytically and experimentally that the strength (i.e. the weighted node degree) density of such a network model can be well approximated by a power law with $\gamma \approx 0.35$. Possible implications for neuronal networks topology and dynamics are also discussed.
"Let $A,B$ be two rings and let $ X$ be an $ A-$module. An additive map $h: A\to B$ is called n-ring homomorphism if $h(\Pi^n_{i=1}a_i)=\Pi^n_{i=1}h(a_i),$ for all $a_1,a_2, ...,a_n \in {A}$. An additive map $D: A\to X$ is called $n$-ring derivation if $$D(\Pi^n_{i=1}a_i)=D(a_1)a_2... a_n+a_1D(a_2)a_3... a_n+... +a_1a_2... a_{n-1}D(a_n),$$ for all $a_1,a_2, ...,a_n \in {\mathcal A}$. In this paper we investigate the Hyers-Ulam-Rassias stability of $n$-ring homomorphisms and n-ring derivations. "
We study the effects of the Chern-Simons term in the hydrodynamics of the five-dimensional Reissner-Nordstrom-AdS background. We work out the decoupling problem of the equations of motion and calculate the retarded Green functions explicitly. We then find that the Chern-Simons term induces the magnetic conductivity caused by the anomaly effect. It is increasing function of temperature running from a non-zero value at zero temperature to the twice the value at infinite temperature.
A revised version with a number of corrections and refinements.
"Let $K$ be a number field, which is tame and non totally real. In this article we give a numerical criterion, depending only on the ramification behavior of ramified primes in $K$, to decide whether or not the integral trace of $K$ is isometric to the integral trace of another number field $L$. As a byproduct of our proofs here, and in contrast with our previous results for cubic fields of positive discriminant, we show that for cubic fields of negative discriminant isometry between integral traces is equivalent to equality of discriminants. "
"In this paper we provide a complete characterisation of transitive fractional jumps by showing that they can only arise from transitive projective automorphisms. Furthermore, we prove that such construction is feasible for arbitrarily large dimension by exhibiting an infinite class of projectively primitive polynomials whose companion matrix can be used to define a full orbit sequence over an affine space. "
"In 1879, Thomae discussed the relations between two generic hypergeometric $_3F_2$-series with argument 1. It is well-known since then that there are 120 such relations (including the trivial ones which come from permutations of the parameters of the hypergeometric series). More recently, Rhin and Viola asked the following question (in a different, but equivalent language of integrals): If there exists a linear dependence relation over $\mathbf Q$ between two convergent $_3F_2$-series with argument 1, with integral parameters, and whose values are irrational numbers, is this relation a specialisation of one of the 120 Thomae relations? A few years later, Sato answered this question in the negative, by giving six examples of relations which cannot be explained by Thomae's relations. We show that Sato's counter-examples can be naturally embedded into two families of infinitely many $_3F_2$-relations, both parametrised by three independent parameters. Moreover, we find two more infinite families of the same nature. The families, which do not seem to have been recorded before, come from certain $_3F_2$-transformation formulae and contiguous relations. We also explain in detail the relationship between the integrals of Rhin and Viola and $_3F_2$-series. "
"Let $\mathfrak{g}_{\mathbb{R}}$ be a split real, simple Lie algebra with complexification $\mathfrak{g}$. Let $G_{\mathbb{C}}$ be the connected, simply connected Lie group with Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$, $G_{\mathbb{R}}$ the connected subgroup of $G_{\mathbb{C}}$ with Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}_{\mathbb{R}}$, and $G$ a covering group of $G_{\mathbb{R}}$ with a maximal compact subgroup $K$. A complete classification of ""small"" $K$ types is derived via Clifford algebras, and an analog, $P^{\xi}$, of Kostant's $P^{\gamma}$ matrix is defined for a $K$ type ${\xi}$ of principal series admitting a small $K$ type. For the connected, simply connected, split real forms of simple Lie types other than type $C_n$, a product formula for the determinant of $P^{\xi}$ over the rank one subgroups corresponding to the positive roots is proved. We use these results to determine cyclicity of a small $K$ type of principal series in the closed Langlands chamber and irreducibility of the unitary principal series admitting a small $K$ type. "
"We study a dephasing channel with memory, described by a Hamiltonian model in which the system-environment interaction is described by a stochastic process. We propose a useful way to describe the channel uses correlations. Moreover, we give a general expression for the coherences decay factors as a function of the number of channel uses and of the stochastic process power spectrum. We also study the impact of memory on the three qubit code, showing that correlations among channel uses affect very little the code performance. "
"In this work we introduce the concept of $s$-sparse observability for large systems of ordinary differential equations. Let $\dot x=f(t,x)$ be such a system. At time $T>0$, suppose we make a set of observations $b=Ax(T)$ of the solution of the system with initial data $x(0)=x^0$, where $A$ is a matrix satisfying the restricted isometry property. The aim of this paper is to give answers to the following questions: Given the observations $b$, is $x^0$ uniquely determined knowing that $x^0$ is sufficiently sparse? Is there any way to reconstruct such a sparse initial data $x^0$? "
"In this paper, we study a numerical approximation for a class of stationary states for reaction-diffusion system with m densities having disjoint support, which are governed by a minimization problem. We use quantitative properties of both solutions and free boundaries to derive our scheme. Furthermore, the proof of convergence of the numerical method is given in some particular cases. We also apply our numerical simulations for the spatial segregation limit of diffusive Lotka-Volterra models in presence of high competition and inhomogeneous Dirichlet boundary conditions. We discuss numerical implementations of the resulting approach and present computational tests. "
"Given a null-cobordant oriented framed link $L$ in a closed oriented $3$--manifold $M$, we determine those links in $M \setminus L$ which can be realized as the singular point set of a generic map $M \to \mathbb{R}^2$ that has $L$ as an oriented framed regular fiber. Then, we study the linking behavior between the singular point set and regular fibers for generic maps of $M$ into $\mathbb{R}^2$. "
"Quantization of a harmonic oscillator with inverse square potential $V(x)=(m{\omega^2}/2){x^2}+g/{x^2}$ on the line $-\infty<x<\infty$ is re-examined. It is shown that, for $0<g<3{\hbar^2}/(8m)$, the system admits a U(2) family of inequivalent quantizations allowing for quantum tunneling through the potenatial barrier at $x=0$. In the family is a distinguished quantization which reduces smoothly to the harmonic oscillator as $g\to 0$, in contrast to the conventional quantization applied to the Calogero model which prohibits the tunneling and has no such limit. The tunneling renders the classical caustics anomalous at the quantum level, leading to the possibility of copying an arbitrary state from one side $x>0$, say, to the other $x<0$. "
"Fractal geometry is the study of sets which exhibit the same pattern at multiple scales. Developing tools to study these sets is of great interest. One step towards developing some of these tools is recognizing the duality between topological spaces and commutative $C^\ast$-algebras. When one lifts the commutativity axiom, one gets what are called noncommutative spaces and the study of noncommutative geometry. The tools built to study noncommutative spaces can in fact be used to study fractal sets. In what follows we will use the spectral triples of noncommutative geometry to describe various notions from fractal geometry. We focus on the fractal sets known as the harmonic Sierpinski gasket and the stretched Sierpinski gasket, and show that the spectral triples constructed by Christensen, Ivan, and Lapidus in 2008 and Lapidus and Sarhad in 2015, can recover the standard self-affine measure in the case of the harmonic Sierpinski gasket and the Hausdorff dimension, geodesic metric, and Hausdorff measure in the case of the stretched Sierpinski gasket. "
"In the framework of the spacetime with torsion, we obtain the flavor evolution equation of the mass neutrino oscillation in vacuum. A comparison with the result of general relativity case, it shows that the flavor evolutionary equations in Riemann spacetime and Weitzenb\""ock spacetimes are equivalent in the spherical symmetric Schwarzschild spacetime, but turns out to be different in the case of the axial symmetry. "
"We study detectability properties for labeled Petri nets and finite automata. We first study weak approximate detectability (WAD) that implies that there exists an infinite observed output sequence of the system such that each prefix of the output sequence with length greater than a given value allows an observer to determine if the current state belongs to a given set. We also consider two new concepts called instant strong detectability (ISD) and eventual strong detectability (ESD). The former property implies that for each possible infinite observed output sequence each prefix of the output sequence allows reconstructing the current state. The latter implies that for each possible infinite observed output sequence, there exists a value such that each prefix of the output sequence with length greater than that value allows reconstructing the current state. Results: WAD: undecidable for labeled Petri nets, PSPACE-complete for finite automata ISD: decidable and EXPSPACE-hard for labeled Petri nets, belongs to P for finite automata ESD: decidable under promptness assumption and EXPSPACE-hard for labeled Petri nets, belongs to P for finite automata SD: belongs to P for finite automata, strengthens Shu and Lin's 2011 results based on two assumptions of deadlock-freeness and promptness ISD<SD<ESD<WD<WAD for both labeled Petri nets and finite automata "
"We calculate the electric conductivity of a gas of relativistic particles with isotropic cross sections using the Boltzmann equation as the starting point. Our analyses is restricted to elastic collisions. We show the perfect agreement with previously published numerical results for a massless quark- gluon plasma, and give results for the electric conductivity of an interacting hadron gas, employing realistic resonance cross sections. These results for the electric conductivity of a hot hadron gas, as created in (ultra-)relativistic heavy-ion collisions, are of rich phenomenological as well as theoretical interest and can be compared to, e.g., lattice quantum field theory calculations. "
"A space $X$ is said to be $\kappa$-resolvable (resp. almost $\kappa$-resolvable) if it contains $\kappa$ dense sets that are pairwise disjoint (resp. almost disjoint over the ideal of nowhere dense subsets). $X$ is maximally resolvable iff it is $\Delta(X)$-resolvable, where $\Delta(X) = \min\{|G| : G \ne \emptyset {open}\}.$ We show that every crowded monotonically normal (in short: MN) space is $\omega$-resolvable and almost $\mu$-resolvable, where $\mu = \min\{2^{\omega}, \omega_2 \}$. On the other hand, if $\kappa$ is a measurable cardinal then there is a MN space $X$ with $\Delta(X) = \kappa$ such that no subspace of $X$ is $\omega_1$-resolvable. Any MN space of cardinality $< \aleph_\omega$ is maximally resolvable. But from a supercompact cardinal we obtain the consistency of the existence of a MN space $X$ with $|X| = \Delta(X) = \aleph_{\omega}$ such that no subspace of $X$ is $\omega_2$-resolvable. "
"Recently, the notions of Weak Measurement (WM), Weak Value (WV) and Two-State-Vector Formalism (TSVF), firstly introduced by Aharonov and collaborators, have extended the theoretical frame of standard quantum mechanics, thus providing a quantum-theoretical formalism for extracting new information from a system in the limit of small disturbance to its state. Here we provide an application to the case of two-body scattering with one body weakly interacting with its environment --- e.g. a neutron being scattered from a H2 molecule physisorbed in a carbon nanotube. In particular, we make contact with the field of incoherent inelastic neutron scattering from condensed systems. We provide a physically compelling prediction of a new quantum effect --- a momentum transfer deficit; or equivalently, an enhanced energy transfer; or an apparent reduction of the mass of the struck particle. E.g., when a neutron collides with a H2 molecule in a C-nanotube and excites its translational motion along the nanotube, it apparently exchanges energy and momentum with a fictitious particle with mass of 0.64 atomic mass units. Experimental results are shown and discussed in the new theoretical frame. The effect under consideration has no conventional interpretation, thus also supporting the novelty of the quantum theoretical framework of WV and TVSF. Some speculative remarks about possible applications being of technological interest (fuel cells and hydrogen storage; Li+ batteries; information and communication technology) are shortly mentioned. \end{abstract} "
"A model system of equations has been derived to describe a toroidally rotating tokamak plasma, unstable to Resistive Wall Modes (RWMs) and metastable to Neoclassical Tearing Modes (NTMs), using a linear RWM model and a nonlinear NTM model. If no wall is present, the NTM growth shows the typical threshold/saturation island widths, whereas a linearly unstable kink mode grows exponentially in this model plasma system. When a resistive wall is present, the growth of the linearly unstable RWM is accelerated by an unstable island: a form of coupled RWM-NTM mode. Crucially, this coupled system has no threshold island width, giving the impression of a triggerless NTM, observed in high beta tokamak discharges. Increasing plasma rotation at the island location can mitigate its growth, decoupling the modes to yield a conventional RWM with no threshold width. "
"The basic idea of an extremely fast convergent iterative method, the Forth-and-Back Implicit Lambda Iteration (FBILI), is briefly described and the applications of the method to various RT problems are listed and discussed. "
"In this work the influence of the electric and magnetic fields over a tunneling particle in a rectangular potential barrier is shown, we have taken into account the presence of an impurity at the barrier center and the effects of a hydrostatic pressure parallel to the barrier height considering the BenDaniel-Duke boundary conditions. Given that the particle is moving inside a GaAs-AlxGa1-xAs-GaAs heterostructures it is evident a change in the transmission coefficient due to the impurity concentration and the presence of the hydrostatic pressure. The potential due to the presence of the impurity is approximate with a second degree polynomial function that resolves the discontinuity generated by heavily modifying the transmission coefficient. "
"Using the Quantum Inverse Scattering Method for the XXZ model with open boundary conditions, we obtained the determinant formula for the six vertex model with reflecting end. "
"We introduce a class of generalized Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick (gLMG) models with su$(m)$ interactions of Haldane-Shastry type. We have computed the partition function of these models in closed form by exactly evaluating the partition function of the restriction of a spin chain Hamiltonian of Haldane-Shastry type to subspaces with well-defined magnon numbers. As a byproduct of our analysis, we have obtained strong numerical evidence of the Gaussian character of the level density of the latter restricted Hamiltonians, and studied the distribution of the spacings of consecutive unfolded levels. We have also discussed the thermodynamic behavior of a large family of su(2) and su(3) gLMG models, showing that it is qualitatively similar to that of a two-level system. "
"We use the Wetterich equation for foliated spacetimes to study the RG flow of projectable Horava-Lifshitz gravity coupled to n Lifshitz scalars. Using novel results for anisotropic heat kernels, the matter-induced beta functions for the gravitational couplings are computed explicitly. The RG flow exhibits an UV attractive anisotropic Gaussian fixed point where Newton's constant vanishes and the extra scalar mode decouples. This fixed point ensures that the theory is asymptotically free in the large-n expansion, indicating that projectable Horava-Lifshitz gravity is perturbatively renormalizable. Notably, the fundamental fixed point action does not obey detailed balance. "
"In this paper we redefine an increasing filtration on the the Hopf algebra S(n,k), From which we get a spectral sequence called May spectral sequence. As an application we computed $H^{*,*}S(n,n)$ at prime 2, $H^{*,*}S(3,2)$ at prime 3 and $H^{*,*}S(4,2)$ at prime $p\geqslant 5$ "
"We study harmonic maps from degenerating Riemann surfaces with uniformly bounded energy and show the so-called generalized energy identity. We find conditions that are both necessary and sufficient for the compactness in $W^{1,2}$ and $C^{0}$ modulo bubbles of sequences of such maps. "
"The use of irony and sarcasm in social media allows us to study them at scale for the first time. However, their diversity has made it difficult to construct a high-quality corpus of sarcasm in dialogue. Here, we describe the process of creating a large- scale, highly-diverse corpus of online debate forums dialogue, and our novel methods for operationalizing classes of sarcasm in the form of rhetorical questions and hyperbole. We show that we can use lexico-syntactic cues to reliably retrieve sarcastic utterances with high accuracy. To demonstrate the properties and quality of our corpus, we conduct supervised learning experiments with simple features, and show that we achieve both higher precision and F than previous work on sarcasm in debate forums dialogue. We apply a weakly-supervised linguistic pattern learner and qualitatively analyze the linguistic differences in each class. "
"Inspired by the chemical metaphor, this paper proposes an extension of Linda-like languages in the aim of modeling the coordination of complex distributed systems. The new language manipulates finite sets of tuples and distributes a density among them. This new concept adds to the non-determinism inherent in the selection of matched tuples a non-determinism to the tell, ask and get primitives on the consideration of different tuples. Furthermore, thanks to de Boer and Palamidessi's notion of modular embedding, we establish that this new language strictly increases the expressiveness of the Dense Bach language introduced earlier and, consequently, Linda-like languages. "
"In the first part of this paper, we obtain symmetric formulae for the probabilities that a plane convex body hits exactly 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 triangles of a lattice of congruent triangles in the plane. Furthermore, a very simple formula for the expectation of the number of hit triangles is derived. In the second part, we calculate the hitting probabilities in the cases where the convex body is a rectangle, an ellipse and a half disc. Already known results for a line segment (needle) follow as special cases of the rectangle and the ellipse. "
"Quoted speech is often set off by punctuation marks, in particular quotation marks. Thus, it might seem that the quotation marks would be extremely useful in identifying these structures in texts. Unfortunately, the situation is not quite so clear. In this work, I will argue that quotation marks are not adequate for either identifying or constraining the syntax of quoted speech. More useful information comes from the presence of a quoting verb, which is either a verb of saying or a punctual verb, and the presence of other punctuation marks, usually commas. Using a lexicalized grammar, we can license most quoting clauses as text adjuncts. A distinction will be made not between direct and indirect quoted speech, but rather between adjunct and non-adjunct quoting clauses. "
"We describe a reproduction procedure which, given a solution of the $\mathfrak{gl}_{M|N}$ Gaudin Bethe ansatz equation associated to a tensor product of polynomial modules, produces a family $P$ of other solutions called the population. To a population we associate a rational pseudodifferential operator $R$ and a superspace $W$ of rational functions. We show that if at least one module is typical then the population $P$ is canonically identified with the set of minimal factorizations of $R$ and with the space of full superflags in $W$. We conjecture that the singular eigenvectors (up to rescaling) of all $\mathfrak{gl}_{M|N}$ Gaudin Hamiltonians are in a bijective correspondence with certain superspaces of rational functions. "
"Let G be a discrete group. We give methods to compute for a generalized (co-)homology theory its values on the Borel construction (EG x X)/G of a proper G-CW-complex X satisfying certain finiteness conditions. In particular we give formulas computing the topological K-(co)homology of the classifying space BG up to finite abelian torsion groups. They apply for instance to arithmetic groups, word hyperbolic groups, mapping class groups and discrete cocompact subgroups of almost connected Lie groups. For finite groups G these formulas are sharp. The main new tools we use for the K-theory calculation are a Cocompletion Theorem and Equivariant Universal Coefficient Theorems which are of independent interest. In the case where G is a finite group these theorems reduce to well-known results of Greenlees and Boekstedt. "
"The Volterra series is a powerful tool in modelling a broad range of nonlinear dynamic systems. However, due to its nonparametric nature, the number of parameters in the series increases rapidly with memory length and series order, with the uncertainty in resulting model estimates increasing accordingly. In this paper, we propose an identification method where the Volterra kernels are estimated indirectly through orthonormal basis function expansions, with regularization applied directly to the expansion coefficients to reduce variance in the final model estimate and provide access to useful models at previously unfeasible series orders. The higher dimensional kernel expansions are regularized using a method that allows smoothness and decay to be imposed on the entire hyper-surface. Numerical examples demonstrate improved Volterra series estimation up to the 4th order using the regularized basis function method. "
"Suppose a locally compact group G acts freely and properly on a locally compact Hausdorff space X, and let gamma be the induced action on C_0(X). We consider a category in which the objects are C*-dynamical systems (A, G, alpha) for which there is an equivariant homomorphism of (C_0(X), gamma) into the multiplier algebra M(A). Rieffel has shown that such systems are proper and saturated, and hence have a generalized fixed-point algebra A^alpha which is Morita equivalent to A times_{alpha,r} G. We show that the assignment (A, alpha) maps to A^alpha is functorial, and that Rieffel's Morita equivalence is natural in a suitable sense. We then use our results to prove a categorical version of Landstad duality which characterizes crossed products by coactions, and to prove that Mansfield imprimitivity for crossed products by homogeneous spaces is natural. "
"A study of the lithium abundances in binaries of the old open cluster M67 is presented. Abundances were estimated using curves of growth and equivalent widths of the LiI6707.8 \AA{} doublet. We have corrected of the effects of the companion on the measured equivalent width and on the color indices by deconvolving the photometry, computing colors and magnitudes for each component. As happens in the Hyades cluster, there are some lithium excesses in main-sequence and evolved TLBS binaries with respect other binaries and single stars, although the M67 data have large errors. "
"We present a toolchain for developing and verifying smart contracts that can be executed on Bitcoin. The toolchain is based on BitML, a recent domain-specific language for smart contracts with a computationally sound embedding into Bitcoin. Our toolchain automatically verifies relevant properties of contracts, among which liquidity, ensuring that funds do not remain frozen within a contract forever. A compiler is provided to translate BitML contracts into sets of standard Bitcoin transactions: executing a contract corresponds to appending these transactions to the blockchain. We assess our toolchain through a benchmark of representative contracts. "
"In this paper, we propose a novel method that exploits music listening log data for general-purpose music feature extraction. Despite the wealth of information available in the log data of user-item interactions, it has been mostly used for collaborative filtering to find similar items or users and was not fully investigated for content-based music applications. We resolve this problem by extending intra-domain knowledge distillation to cross-domain: i.e., by transferring knowledge obtained from the user-item domain to the music content domain. The proposed system first trains the model that estimates log information from the audio contents; then it uses the model to improve other task-specific models. The experiments on various music classification and regression tasks show that the proposed method successfully improves the performances of the task-specific models. "
"There are various non-equivalent definitions of locality. Three of them, impossibility of instantaneous communication, impossibility of action-at-a-distance, and impossibility of faster-than-light travel, while not fully implying each other, have a large overlap. When the term non-locality is used, most physicists think that one of these three conditions is being violated. There is a minority of physicists, however, who uses ""locality"" with a fourth meaning, the satisfaction of the hypotheses underlying Bell inequality. This definition devoids Bell's theorem of its profoundness, reducing it to a mere tautology. It is demonstrated here, through a classical example using a deck of cards, that this latter definition of ""locality"" is untenable. "
"Studies of the diffuse Galactic radio emission are interesting both for better understanding the physical conditions in our Galaxy and for minimising the contamination in cosmological measurements. Motivated by this we present Cosmic Background Imager 31 GHz observations of the Galactic regions NGC 6357, NGC 6334, W51 and W40 at $\sim$4$'$.5 resolution and conduct an investigation of the spectral emission process in the regions at 4$'$.5 and 1$^{\circ}$ resolution. We find that most of the emission in the regions is due to optically thin free-free. For 2 sub-regions of NGC 6334 and for a sub-region of W51 though, at 4$'$.5 resolution and at 31 GHz we detect less emission than expected from extrapolation of radio data at lower frequencies assuming a spectral index of $-$0.12 for optically thin free-free emission, at 3.3$\sigma$, 3.7$\sigma$ and 6.5$\sigma$ respectively. We also detect excess emission in a sub-region of NCG 6334 at 6.4$\sigma$, after ruling out any possible contribution from Ultra Compact HII (UCHII) regions. At 1$^{\circ}$ resolution we detect a spinning dust component in the Spectral Energy Distribution (SED) of W40 that accounts for 18$\pm$7 % of the total flux density in the region at the peak frequency of 37 GHz. Comparison with 100 ${\rm \mu m}$ data indicate an average dust emissivity for the sub-regions of $0.5\pm4.4$ $\mu$K(MJy sr$^{-1}$)$^{-1}$. Finally we translate the excess emission in the regions to an Anomalous Microwave Emission (AME) emissivity relative to the optical depth at 250 ${\rm \mu m }$. We find that this form of emissivity is independent of the AME significance and has a value somewhere in the order of 10$^4$ Jy. "
"The Weyl algebra (W_{2m}[h]; *) is the algebra generated by u=(u_1,...,u_m,v_1,.....,v_m) over C with the fundamental commutation relation [u_i,v_j]=-ih\delta_{ij}, where h is a positive constant. The Heisenberg algebra (\Cal H_{2m}[nu];*) is the algebra given by regarding the scalar parameter h in the Weyl algebra W_{2m}[h] to be a generator nu which commutes with all others. "
"The Mg II h&k lines are powerful diagnostics for studying the solar chromosphere. They have become particularly popular with the launch of the IRIS satellite, and a number of studies that include these lines have lead to great progress in understanding chromospheric heating, in many cases thanks to the support from 3D MHD simulations. In this study we utilize another approach to analyze observations: non-LTE inversions of the Mg II h&k and UV triplet lines including the effects of partial redistribution. Our inversion code attempts to construct a model atmosphere that is compatible with the observed spectra. We have assessed the capabilities and limitations of the inversions using the FALC atmosphere and a snapshot from a 3D radiation-MHD simulation. We find that Mg II h&k allow reconstructing a model atmosphere from the middle photosphere to the transition region. We have also explored the capabilities of a multi-line/multi-atom setup, including the Mg II h&k, the Ca II 854.2 nm and the Fe I 630.25 lines to recover the full stratification of physical parameters, including the magnetic field vector, from the photosphere to the chromosphere. Finally, we present the first inversions of observed IRIS spectra from quiet-Sun, plage and sunspot, with very promising results. "
"The phantom inflation predicts a slightly blue spectrum of tensor perturbation, which might be tested in coming observations. In normal inflation models, the introduction of step in its potential generally results in an oscillation in the primordial power spectrum of curvature perturbation. We will check whether there is a similar case in the phantom inflation with steplike potential. We find that for same potentials, the oscillation of the spectrum of phantom inflation is nearly same with that of normal inflation, the difference between them is the tilt of power spectrum. "
"Feature selection has been recently used in the area of software engineering for improving the accuracy and robustness of software cost models. The idea behind selecting the most informative subset of features from a pool of available cost drivers stems from the hypothesis that reducing the dimensionality of datasets will significantly minimise the complexity and time required to reach to an estimation using a particular modelling technique. This work investigates the appropriateness of attributes, obtained from empirical project databases and aims to reduce the cost drivers used while preserving performance. Finding suitable subset selections that may cater improved predictions may be considered as a pre-processing step of a particular technique employed for cost estimation (filter or wrapper) or an internal (embedded) step to minimise the fitting error. This paper compares nine relatively popular feature selection methods and uses the empirical values of selected attributes recorded in the ISBSG and Desharnais datasets to estimate software development effort. "
"We give a new Esakia-style duality for the category of Sugihara monoids based on the Davey-Werner natural duality for lattices with involution, and use this duality to greatly simplify a construction due to Galatos-Raftery of Sugihara monoids from certain enrichments of their negative cones. Our method of obtaining this simplification is to transport the functors of the Galatos-Raftery construction across our duality, obtaining a vastly more transparent presentation on duals. Because our duality extends Dunn's relational semantics for the logic R-mingle to a categorical equivalence, this also explains the Dunn semantics and its relationship with the more usual Routley-Meyer semantics for relevant logics. "
"Tunka-Rex, the Tunka Radio extension at the TAIGA facility (Tunka Advanced Instrument for cosmic ray physics and Gamma Astronomy) in Siberia, has recently been expanded to a total number 63 SALLA antennas, most of them distributed on an area of one square kilometer. In the first years of operation, Tunka-Rex was solely triggered by the co-located air-Cherenkov array Tunka-133. The correlation of the measurements by both detectors has provided direct experimental proof that radio arrays can measure the position of the shower maximum. The precision achieved so far is 40 g/cm^2, and several methodical improvements are under study. Moreover, the cross-comparison of Tunka-Rex and Tunka-133 shows that the energy reconstruction of Tunka-Rex is precise to 15 %, with a total accuracy of 20 % including the absolute energy scale. By using exactly the same calibration source for Tunka-Rex and LOPES, the energy scale of their host experiments, Tunka-133 and KASCADE-Grande, respectively, can be compared even more accurately with a remaining uncertainty of about 10 %. The main goal of Tunka-Rex for the next years is a study of the cosmic-ray mass composition in the energy range above 100 PeV: For this purpose, Tunka-Rex now is triggered also during daytime by the particle detector array Tunka-Grande featuring surface and underground scintillators for electron and muon detection. "
"The Higgs mechanism is the favourite cure for the main problem with electroweak unification, namely how to reconcile a gauge theory with the need for massive gauge bosons. This problem does not exist in preon models for quark and lepton substructure with composite $Z^0$ and $W$s, which, consequently, also avoid all other theoretical complications and paradoxes with the Higgs mechanism. We present a new, minimal preon model, which explains the family structure, and predicts several new, heavy quarks, leptons and vector bosons. Our preons obey a phenomenological supersymmetry, but without so-called squarks and sleptons, since this SUSY is effective only on the composite scale. "
"We analyse the spatial clustering properties of the RASS1 Bright Sample, an X-ray flux-limited catalogue of galaxy clusters selected from the southern part of the $ROSAT$ All-Sky Survey. The two-point correlation function $\xi(r)$ of the whole sample is well fitted (in an Einstein-de Sitter model) by the power-law $\xi=(r/r_0)^{-\gamma}$, with $r_0= 21.5^{+3.4}_{-4.4} h^{-1}$ Mpc and $\gamma=2.11^{+0.53}_{-0.56}$ (95.4 per cent confidence level with one fitting parameter). We use the RASS1 Bright Sample as a first application of a theoretical model which aims at predicting the clustering properties of X-ray clusters in flux-limited surveys for different cosmological scenarios. The model uses the theoretical and empirical relations between mass, temperature and X-ray cluster luminosity, and fully accounts for the redshift evolution of the underlying dark matter clustering and cluster bias factor. The comparison between observational results and theoretical predictions shows that the Einstein-de Sitter models display too low a correlation length, while models with a matter density parameter $\Omega_{\rm 0m}=0.3$ (with or without a cosmological constant) are successful in reproducing the observed clustering. The dependence of the correlation length $r_0$ on the X-ray limiting flux and luminosity of the sample is generally consistent with the predictions of all our models. Quantitative agreement is however only reached for $\Omega_{\rm 0m} = 0.3$ models. The model presented here can be reliably applied to future deeper X-ray cluster surveys: the study of their clustering properties will provide a useful complementary tool to the traditional cluster abundance analyses to constrain the cosmological parameters. "
"We consider the Horava-Witten based model with 5-branes situated near the distant orbifold plane and with vanishing instanton numbers on the physical plane. This model has a toric fibered Calabi-Yau with del Pezzo base dP_7 which allows three generations with Standard Model gauge group at the GUT scale. Previous analysis showed that the quark hierarchy at the electroweak scale could be achieved qualitatively without undue fine tuning due to the effects of the 5-branes on the Kahler potential. We extend here this analysis to include the leptons. A new mechanism is introduced to obtain neutrino masses by assuming massless right handed neutrinos exist in the particle spectrum, which allows a cubic holomorphic term to exist in the Kahler metric, l_L*H_2*nu_R, scaled by the 11D Planck mass. After transferring this term to the superpotential, this term gives rise to neutrino masses of the correct size at the electroweak scale. With natural choices of the Yukawa and Kahler matrix entries, it is possible to fit all mass, CKM and MNS experimental data. The model predicts mu -> e + gamma decay at a rate that should be detectable for much of the SUSY parameter space in the next round of experiments. "
"The evolution with redshift of the temperature-luminosity relation of X-ray galaxy clusters is a key ingredient to break degeneracies in the interpretation of X-ray clusters redshift number counts. We therefore take advantage of the recent measurements of the temperature-luminosity relation of distant clusters observed with XMM-Newton and Chandra satellites to examine theoretical number counts expected for different available X-rays cluster samples, namely the RDCS, EMSS, SHARC, 160deg^2 and the MACS at redshift greater than 0.3. We derive these counts without any adjustment, using models previously normalized to the local temperature distribution function and to the high-z (z = 0.33) TDF. We find that these models having Omega_M in the range [0.85-1.] predict counts in remarkable agreement with the observed counts in the different samples. We illustrate that this conclusion is weakly sensitive to the various ingredients of the modeling. Therefore number counts provide a robust evidence of an evolving population. A realistic flat low density model (Omega_M = 0.3), normalized to the local abundance of clusters is found to overproduce cluster abundance at high redshift (above z = 0.5) by nearly an order of magnitude. This result is in conflict with the popular concordance model. The conflict could indicate a deviation from the expected scaling of the M-T relation with redshift. "
We give an explicit description of all the exchange relations in any finite type cluster algebra with acyclic initial seed and principal coefficients.
Smooth deformations of a Minkowski type metric in a four-dimensional space-time manifold are considered. Deformations of the basic spin-tensorial fields associated with this metric are calculated and their application to calculating the energy-momentum tensor of a massive spin 1/2 particle is shown.
"Shesop is an integrated system to make human lives more easily and to help people in terms of healthcare. Stress and influenza classification is a part of Shesop's application for a healthcare devices such as smartwatch, polar and fitbit. The main objective of this paper is to classify a new data and inform whether you are stress, depressed, caught by influenza or not. We will use the heart rate data taken for months in Bandung, analyze the data and find the Heart rate variance that constantly related with the stress and flu level. After we found the variable, we will use the variable as an input to the support vector machine learning. We will use the lagrangian and kernel technique to transform 2D data into 3D data so we can use the linear classification in 3D space. In the end, we could use the machine learning's result to classify new data and get the final result immediately: stress or not, influenza or not. "
"We investigate the effect of quenched spatial disordered hopping rates on the characteristics of the asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) with open boundaries both numerically and by extensive simulations. Disorder averages of the bulk density and current are obtained in terms of various input and output rates. We study the binary and uniform distributions of disorder. It is verified that the effect of spatial inhomogeneity is generically to enlarge the size of the maximal current phase. This is in accordance with the mean field results obtained by Harris and Stinchcombe. Furthermore, we obtain the dependence of the current and the bulk density on the characteristics of the disorder distribution function. It is shown that the impact of disorder crucially depends on the particle input and out rates. In some situations, disorder can constructively enhance the current. "
"Person re-identification (ReID) focuses on identifying people across different scenes in video surveillance, which is usually formulated as a binary classification task or a ranking task in current person ReID approaches. In this paper, we take both tasks into account and propose a multi-task deep network (MTDnet) that makes use of their own advantages and jointly optimize the two tasks simultaneously for person ReID. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to integrate both tasks in one network to solve the person ReID. We show that our proposed architecture significantly boosts the performance. Furthermore, deep architecture in general requires a sufficient dataset for training, which is usually not met in person ReID. To cope with this situation, we further extend the MTDnet and propose a cross-domain architecture that is capable of using an auxiliary set to assist training on small target sets. In the experiments, our approach outperforms most of existing person ReID algorithms on representative datasets including CUHK03, CUHK01, VIPeR, iLIDS and PRID2011, which clearly demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed approach. "
"In this paper we derive a strong maximum principle for weak supersolutions of nonlocal equations of the form $Iu=c(x) u$ in $\Omega$, where $\Omega\subset \mathbb{R}^N$ is a domain, $c\in L^{\infty}(\Omega)$ and $I$ is an operator of the form $Iu(x)=P.V.\int_{\mathbb{R}^N}(u(x)-u(y))j(x-y)\ dy$ with a nonnegative kernel function $j$. We formulate minimal positivity assumptions on $j$ corresponding to a class of operators which includes highly anisotropic variants of the fractional Laplacian. Somewhat surprisingly, this problem leads to the study of general lattices in $\mathbb{R}^N$. Our results extend to the regional variant of the operator $I$ and, under weak additional assumptions, also to the case of $x$-dependent kernel functions. "
"A coherent technique for the control of photon propagation in optically thick media and its application for quantum memories is discussed. Raman adiabatic passage with an externally controlled Stokes field can be used to transfer the quantum state of a light pulse (``flying'' qubit) to a collective spin-excitation (stationary qubit) and thereby slow down its propagation velocity to zero. The process is reversible and has a potential fidelity of unity without the necessity for strongly coupling resonators. A simple quasi-particle picture (dark-state polariton) of the transfer is presented. The analytic theory is supplemented with exact numerical solutions. Finally the influence of decoherence mechanisms on collective storage states, which are N-particle entangled states, is analyzed. "
We prove two results on the tube algebras of rigid C$^*$-tensor categories. The first is that the tube algebra of the representation category of a compact quantum group $G$ is a full corner of the Drinfeld double of $G$. As an application we obtain some information on the structure of the tube algebras of the Temperley-Lieb categories $TL(d)$ for $d>2$. The second result is that the tube algebras of weakly Morita equivalent C$^*$-tensor categories are strongly Morita equivalent. The corresponding linking algebra is described as the tube algebra of the $2$-category defining the Morita context.
"We report intrinsic tunnelling data for mesa structures fabricated on three over- and optimally-doped $\rm{Bi_{2.15}Sr_{1.85}CaCu_{2}O_{8+\delta}}$ crystals with transition temperatures of 86-78~K and 0.16-0.19~holes per CuO$_2$ unit, for a wide range of temperature ($T$) and applied magnetic field ($H$), primarily focusing on one over-doped crystal(OD80). The differential conductance above the gap edge shows clear dip structure which is highly suggestive of strong coupling to a narrow boson mode. Data below the gap edge suggest that tunnelling is weaker near the nodes of the d-wave gap and give clear evidence for strong $T$-dependent pair breaking. These findings could help theorists make a detailed Eliashberg analysis and thereby contribute towards understanding the pairing mechanism. We show that for our OD80 crystal the gap above $T_c$ although large, is reasonably consistent with the theory of superconducting fluctuations. "
"A scenario is proposed that explains both the observed high pulsar velocities and extragalactic gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). The model involves an ultra- relativistic jet from a supernova (SN), that produces a GRB and its afterglow, whose characteristics are similar to an isotropic fireball GRB perhaps with some differences at late times in the afterglow once some significant transverse diffusion has occurred. The time scales and many other properties of GRBs and their afterglows in this model are consistent with observations. GRBs in this model have special intrinsic properties, that can either falsify or prove this model unambiguously by observations. The most direct proof is the detection of a SN about the same time as the luminous GRB event. Most GRBs and SNe are expected occur at moderate redshift ($z\sim 1-3$), if they follow the observed universal star formation history, as implied in this model. Searching for GRB/SN associations is a challenge, because majority of the SNe will be faint. Some additional, dramatic observable consequences are predicted, which can also be utilized to test the model. "
"This technical report is a catalog of two applications that have been enhanced and developed to augment vehicular networking research. The first application is already described in our previous work [21], while the second one is a desktop application that was developed as a publicly-hosted web app which allows any Internet-connected device to remotely monitor a roadway intersection's state over HTTP. This collaborative work was completed under and for the utility of ETSU's Vehicular Networking Lab. It can serve as a basis for further development in the field of connected and autonomous vehicles. "
"The classical Wiener-Khinchin theorem (WKT), which can extract spectral information by classical interferometers through Fourier transform, is a fundamental theorem used in many disciplines. However, there is still need for a quantum version of WKT, which could connect correlated biphoton spectral information by quantum interferometers. Here, we extend the classical WKT to its quantum counterpart, i.e., extended WKT (e-WKT), which is based on two-photon quantum interferometry. According to the e-WKT, the difference-frequency distribution of the biphoton wavefunctions can be extracted by applying a Fourier transform on the time-domain Hong-Ou-Mandel interference (HOMI) patterns, while the sum-frequency distribution can be extracted by applying a Fourier transform on the time-domain NOON state interference (NOONI) patterns. We also experimentally verified the WKT and e-WKT in a Mach-Zehnder interference (MZI), a HOMI and a NOONI. This theorem can be directly applied to quantum spectroscopy, where the spectral correlation information of biphotons can be obtained from time-domain quantum interferences by Fourier transform. This may open a new pathway for the study of light-matter interaction at the single photon level. "
"In this paper, exploiting the regularities of the corresponding Kolmogorov equations involved we investigate strong convergence of exponential integrator scheme for a range of stochastic partial differential equations, in which the drift term is H\""older continuous, and reveal the rate of convergence. "
"The planetary nebula luminosity function (PNLF) technique for determining distances to galaxies now has been applied to 34 galaxies, including 6 in the Virgo cluster and 3 in the Fornax cluster. Of these, 16 galaxies are late-type or spirals and presumably contain Cepheid variables useful for verifying the PNLF method. For 7 of these galaxies, Cepheid distances exist; the PNLF distances agree with the Cepheid distances within the dispersion of 8% and within a zero-point offset of 1%. In addition, 3 small groups were studied (NGC 1023, Leo I, and Coma I) where both spiral and elliptical distances were obtained to investigate the magnitude of any systematic dependence on spiral versus elliptical Hubble type. None was found. Since the PNLF method agrees well with the Cepheid system, and there is no measurable dependence on Hubble type, it follows that PNLF distances to the ellipticals in Virgo and Fornax also are on the Cepheid scale. This conclusion is strengthened by the Cepheid distances to several Virgo galaxies and the recent determination of a Cepheid distance to Fornax. "
"We report new 350 micron polarization observations of the thermal dust emission from the cores surrounding the low-mass, Class 0 YSOs L1527, IC348-SMM2 and B335. We have inferred magnetic field directions from these observations, and have used them together with results in the literature to determine whether magnetically regulated core-collapse and star-formation models are consistent with the observations. These models predict a pseudo-disk with its symmetry axis aligned with the core magnetic field. The models also predict a magnetic field pinch structure on a scale less than or comparable to the infall radii for these sources. In addition, if the core magnetic field aligns (or nearly aligns) the core rotation axis with the magnetic field before core collapse, then the models predict the alignment (or near alignment) of the overall pinch field structure with the bipolar outflows in these sources. We show that if one includes the distorting effects of bipolar outflows on magnetic fields, then in general the observational results for L1527 and IC348-SMM2 are consistent with these magnetically regulated models. We can say the same for B335 only if we assume the distorting effects of the bipolar outflow on the magnetic fields within the B335 core are much greater than for L1527 and IC348-SMM2. We show that the energy densities of the outflows in all three sources are large enough to distort the magnetic fields predicted by magnetically regulated models. "
"We describe a accurate and fast pixel-based statistical method to interpolate fields of arbitrary spin on the sphere. We call this method Fast and Lean Interpolation on the Sphere (FLINTS). The method predicts the optimal interpolated values based on the theory of isotropic Gaussian random fields and provides an accurate error estimate at no additional cost. We use this method to compute lensed Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) maps precisely and quickly, achieving a relative precision of 0.02% at a HEALPix resolution of Nside=4096, for a bandlimit of l_max=4096 in the same time it takes to simulate the original, unlensed CMB map. The method is suitable for efficient, distributed memory parallelization. The power spectra of our lensed maps are accurate to better than 0.5% at l=3000 for the temperature, the E and B mode of the polarization. As expected theoretically, we demonstrate that, on realistic cases, this method is between two to three orders of magnitude more precise than other known interpolation methods for the same computational cost. "
"We reveal and observe experimentally significant modifications undertaken by discrete solitons in waveguide lattices upon the continuous transformation of the lattice structure from one-dimensional to two-dimensional. Light evolution and soliton excitation in arrays with a gradually increasing number of rows are investigated, yielding solitons with an effective reduced dimensionality residing at the edge and in the bulk of the lattice. "
"In order to investigate various decay channels of the Higgs boson $h$ or the hypothetical dilaton, we consider a neutral particle $X$ with zero spin and arbitrary $CP$ parity. This particle can decay into two off-mass-shell $Z$ bosons ($Z_1^*$ and $Z_2^*$) decaying to identical fermion-antifermion pairs ($f \bar{f}$): $X \to Z_1^* Z_2^* \to f \bar{f} f \bar{f}$. We derive analytical formulas for the fully differential width of this decay and for the fully differential width of $h \to Z_1^* Z_2^* \to 4 \ell$ ($4 \ell$ stands for $4 e$, $4 \mu$, or $2 e 2 \mu$). Integration of these formulas yields some Standard Model histogram distributions of the decay $h \to Z_1^* Z_2^* \to 4 \ell$, which are compared with corresponding Monte Carlo simulated distributions obtained by ATLAS and with ATLAS experimental data. "
"We study the optimal control of storage which is used for both arbitrage and buffering against unexpected events, with particular applications to the control of energy systems in a stochastic and typically time-heterogeneous environment. Our philosophy is that of viewing the problem as being formally one of stochastic dynamic programming, but of using coupling arguments to provide good estimates of the costs of failing to provide necessary levels of buffering. The problem of control then reduces to that of the solution, dynamically in time, of a deterministic optimisation problem which must be periodically re-solved. We show that the optimal control then proceeds locally in time, in the sense that the optimal decision at each time $t$ depends only on a knowledge of the future costs and stochastic evolution of the system for a time horizon which typically extends only a little way beyond $t$. The approach is thus both computationally tractable and suitable for the management of systems over indefinitely extended periods of time. We develop also the associated strong Lagrangian theory (which may be used to assist in the optimal dimensioning of storage), and we provide characterisations of optimal control policies. We give examples based on Great Britain electricity price data. "
We deal with consistency results for the existence of universal models in natural classes of models (more exactly--a somewhat weaker version). We apply a result on quite general family to T_feq and to the class of triangle-free graphs.
"Using Monte Carlo simulation to calculate the Value at Risk (VaR) as a possible risk measure requires adequate techniques. One of these techniques is the application of a compound distribution for the aggregates in a portfolio. In this paper, we consider the aggregated loss of Gamma distributed severities and estimate the VaR by introducing a new approach to calculate the quantile function of the Gamma distribution at high confidence levels. We then compare the VaR obtained from the aggregation process with the VaR obtained from a single loss distribution where the severities are drawn first from an exponential and then from a truncated exponential distribution. We observe that the truncated exponential distribution as a model for the severities yields results closer to those obtained from the aggregation process. The deviations depend strongly on the number of obligors in the portfolio, but also on the amount of gross loss which truncates the exponential distribution. "
"Asymmetries in the neutral hydrogen gas distribution and kinematics of galaxies are thought to be indicators for both gas accretion and gas removal processes. These are of fundamental importance for galaxy formation and evolution. Upcoming large blind HI surveys will provide tens of thousands of galaxies for a study of these asymmetries in a proper statistical way. Due to the large number of expected sources and the limited resolution of the majority of objects, detailed modelling is not feasible for most detections. We need fast, automatic and sensitive methods to classify these objects in an objective way. Existing non-parametric methods suffer from effects like the dependence on signal to noise, resolution and inclination. Here we show how to correctly take these effects into account and show ways to estimate the precision of the methods. We will use existing and modelled data to give an outlook on the performance expected for galaxies observed in the various sky surveys planned for e.g. WSRT/APERTIF and ASKAP. "
"We investigate the physical conditions of ionized gas in high-z star-forming galaxies using diagnostic diagrams based on the rest-frame optical emission lines. The sample consists of 701 galaxies with an Ha detection at $1.4\lesssim z\lesssim1.7$, from the FMOS-COSMOS survey, that represent the normal star-forming population over the stellar mass range $10^{9.6} \lesssim M_\ast/M_\odot \lesssim 10^{11.6}$ with those at $M_\ast>10^{11}~M_\odot$ being well sampled. We confirm an offset of the average location of star-forming galaxies in the BPT diagram ([OIII]/Hb vs. [NII]/Ha), primarily towards higher [OIII]/Hb, compared with local galaxies. Based on the [SII] ratio, we measure an electron density ($n_e=220^{+170}_{-130}~\mathrm{cm^{-3}}$), that is higher than that of local galaxies. Based on comparisons to theoretical models, we argue that changes in emission-line ratios, including the offset in the BPT diagram, are caused by a higher ionization parameter both at fixed stellar mass and at fixed metallicity with additional contributions from a higher gas density and possibly a hardening of the ionizing radiation field. Ionization due to AGNs is ruled out as assessed with Chandra. As a consequence, we revisit the mass-metallicity relation using [NII]/Ha and a new calibration including [NII]/[SII] as recently introduced by Dopita et al. Consistent with our previous results, the most massive galaxies ($M_\ast\gtrsim10^{11}~M_\odot$) are fully enriched, while those at lower masses have metallicities lower than local galaxies. Finally, we demonstrate that the stellar masses, metallicities and star formation rates of the FMOS sample are well fit with a physically-motivated model for the chemical evolution of star-forming galaxies.

"Half-lives of radionuclides span more than 50 orders of magnitude. We characterize the probability distribution of this broad-range data set at the same time that explore a method for fitting power-laws and testing goodness-of-fit. It is found that the procedure proposed recently by Clauset et al. [SIAM Rev. 51, 661 (2009)] does not perform well as it rejects the power-law hypothesis even for power-law synthetic data. In contrast, we establish the existence of a power-law exponent with a value around 1.1 for the half-life density, which can be explained by the sharp relationship between decay rate and released energy, for different disintegration types. For the case of alpha emission, this relationship constitutes an original mechanism of power-law generation. "
"We have examined extended structures, bridges and arches, in computer generated, non-sequentially stabilized, hard sphere deposits. The bridges and arches have well defined distributions of sizes and shapes. The distribution functions reflect the contraints associated with hard particle packing and the details of the restructuring process. A subpopulation of string-like bridges has been identified. Bridges are fundamental microstructural elements in real granular systems and their sizes and shapes dominate considerations of structural properties and flow instabilities such as jamming. "
"Automated 3D pose estimation of satellites and other known space objects is a critical component of space situational awareness. Ground-based imagery offers a convenient data source for satellite characterization; however, analysis algorithms must contend with atmospheric distortion, variable lighting, and unknown reflectance properties. Traditional feature-based pose estimation approaches are unable to discover an accurate correlation between a known 3D model and imagery given this challenging image environment. This paper presents an innovative method for automated 3D pose estimation of known space objects in the absence of satisfactory texture. The proposed approach fits the silhouette of a known satellite model to ground-based imagery via particle filtering. Each particle contains enough information (orientation, position, scale, model articulation) to generate an accurate object silhouette. The silhouette of individual particles is compared to an observed image. Comparison is done probabilistically by calculating the joint probability that pixels inside the silhouette belong to the foreground distribution and that pixels outside the silhouette belong to the background distribution. Both foreground and background distributions are computed by observing empty space. The population of particles are resampled at each new image observation, with the probability of a particle being resampled proportional to how the particle's silhouette matches the observation image. The resampling process maintains multiple pose estimates which is beneficial in preventing and escaping local minimums. Experiments were conducted on both commercial imagery and on LEO satellite imagery. Imagery from the commercial experiments are shown in this paper. "
"A real-space quantum transport simulator for carbon nanoribbon (CNR) MOSFETs has been developed. Using this simulator, the performance of carbon nanoribbon (CNR) MOSFETs is examined in the ballistic limit. The impact of quantum effects on device performance of CNR MOSFETs is also studied. We found that 2D semi-infinite graphene contacts provide metal-induced-gap-states (MIGS) in the CNR channel. These states would provide quantum tunneling in the short channel device and cause Fermi level pining. These effects cause device performance degradation both on the ON-state and the OFF-state. Pure 1D devices (infinite contacts), however, show no MIGS. Quantum tunneling effects are still playing an important role in the device characteristics. Conduction due to band-to-band tunneling is accurately captured in our simulations. It is important in these devices, and found to dominate the off-state current. Based on our simulations, both a 1.4nm wide and a 1.8nm wide CNR with channel length of 12.5nm can outperform ultra scaled Si devices in terms of drive current capabilities and electrostatic control. Although subthreshold slopes in the forward-bias conduction are better than in Si transistors, tunneling currents are important and prevent the achievement of the theoretical limit of 60mV/dec. "
"Since Sleator and Tarjan's seminal work on self-adjusting lists, heaps and binary search trees, researchers have been fascinated by dynamic datastructures and the questions related to their performance over time. This paper initiates the study of another classic datastructure, self-adjusting (binary) Complete Trees (CTs): trees which do not provide a simple search mechanism but allow to efficiently access items given a global map. Our problem finds applications, e.g., in the context of warehouse optimization or self-adjusting communication networks which can adapt to the demand they serve. We show that self-adjusting complete trees assume an interesting position between the complexity of self-adjusting (unordered) lists and binary search trees. In particular, we observe that in contrast to lists, a simple move-to-front strategy alone is insufficient to achieve a constant competitive ratio. Rather, and similarly to binary search trees, an additional (efficient) tree update rule is needed. Intriguingly, while it is unknown whether the working set is a lower bound for binary search trees, we show that this holds in our model. So while finding an update rule is still an open problem for binary search trees, this paper shows that there exists a simple, random update rule for complete trees. Our main result is a dynamically optimal (i.e., constant competitive) self-adjusting CT called Push-Down Tree, on expectation against an oblivious adversary. At the heart of our approach lies a distributed algorithm called Random-Push: this algorithm approximates a natural notion of Most Recently Used (MRU) tree (essentially an approximate working set), by first performing move-to-front, but then pushing less recently accessed items down the tree using a random walk. "
The main goal of this paper is to prove that the idempotent completions of the triangulated categories of singularities of two schemes are equivalent if the formal completions of these schemes along singularities are isomorphic. We also discuss Thomason theorem on dense subcategories and a relation to the negative K-theory.
"For opto-electronic and photo-voltaic applications of perovskites, it is essential to know the optical properties and intrinsic losses of the used materials. A systematic microscopic analysis is presented for the example of methylammonium lead iodide where density functional theory is used to calculate the electronic band structure as well as the dipole and Coulomb matrix elements. These results serve as input for a many-body quantum approach used to compute the absorption, photoluminescence, and the optical and Auger losses for a wide range of application conditions. To illustrate the theory, the excitonic properties of the material system are investigated and numerical results are presented for typical photo-voltaic operation conditions and for the elevated carrier densities needed for laser operation.

"Let $p$ be an odd prime and let $a,m$ be integers with $a>0$ and $m \not\equiv0\pmod p$. In this paper we determine $\sum_{k=0}^{p^a-1}\binom{2k}{k+d}/m^k$ mod $p^2$ for $d=0,1$; for example, $$\sum_{k=0}^{p^a-1}\frac{\binom{2k}k}{m^k}\equiv\left(\frac{m^2-4m}{p^a}\right)+\left(\frac{m^2-4m}{p^{a-1}}\right)u_{p-(\frac{m^2-4m}{p})}\pmod{p^2},$$ where $(-)$ is the Jacobi symbol, and $\{u_n\}_{n\geqslant0}$ is the Lucas sequence given by $u_0=0$, $u_1=1$ and $u_{n+1}=(m-2)u_n-u_{n-1}$ for $n=1,2,3,\ldots$. As an application, we determine $\sum_{0<k<p^a,\, k\equiv r\pmod{p-1}}C_k$ modulo $p^2$ for any integer $r$, where $C_k$ denotes the Catalan number $\binom{2k}k/(k+1)$. We also pose some related conjectures. "
"We report a numerical study of transport properties of a quantum dot with superconducting leads. We introduce a general phenomenological model of quantum dot transport, in which electron tunnel rates are computed within the Fermi's Golden Rule approach. The low temperature current-voltage (I-V) characteristics are in qualitative agreement with experimental observations of Ralph et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett., 74, 3241 (1995)]. At higher temperatures, our results reveal new effects due to the thermal excitation of quasiparticles in the leads as well as the thermal population of excited quantum levels in the dot. We also study the photon-assisted tunneling phenomena in our system and point out its potential for millimeter wave applications. "
"It is demonstrated how the non-proprietary OpenACC standard of compiler directives may be used to compactly and efficiently accelerate the rate-determining steps of two of the most routinely applied many-body methods of electronic structure theory, namely the second-order M{\o}ller-Plesset (MP2) model in its resolution-of-the-identity (RI) approximated form and the (T) triples correction to the coupled cluster singles and doubles model (CCSD(T)). By means of compute directives as well as the use of optimized device math libraries, the operations involved in the energy kernels have been ported to graphics processing unit (GPU) accelerators, and the associated data transfers correspondingly optimized to such a degree that the final implementations (using either double and/or single precision arithmetics) are capable of scaling to as large systems as allowed for by the capacity of the host central processing unit (CPU) main memory. The performance of the hybrid CPU/GPU implementations is assessed through calculations on test systems of alanine amino acid chains using one-electron basis sets of increasing size (ranging from double- to pentuple-zeta quality). For all but the smallest problem sizes of the present study, the optimized accelerated codes (using a single multi-core CPU host node in conjunction with six GPUs) are found to be capable of reducing the total time-to-solution by at least an order of magnitude over optimized, OpenMP-threaded CPU-only reference implementations.

"The authors discuss potential remarkable achievements for pulsar science with the FAST (pulsar monitoring, timing and searching, as well as others related), and expect a FAST era of pulsar science to come. "
"We calculate the ground states and ground state phase diagrams of Bose-Einstein condensates of spin-3 atoms under the assumption of conserved magnetization. We especially concentrate on the ground states of a chromium condensate. In chromium the magnetic dipole-dipole interaction enables magnetization changing collisions, but in a strong magnetic field these are suppressed. In the calculation of the phase diagrams we neglect the contribution from the dipole-dipole interaction, but discuss its effects at the end of the paper. We show that the ground state of a chromium condensate does not seem to depend on whether or not the dipole-dipole interaction is taken into attention. "
"Based on the calculation of survival probabilities, we discuss the problem of extracting the value of $G_{3P}$, the triple Pomeron 'bare' coupling constant, by comparing the large rapidity gap single high mass diffraction data in proton-proton scattering and $J/\Psi$ photo and DIS production. For p-p scattering the calculation in a three amplitude rescattering eikonal model, predicts the survival probability to be an order of magnitude smaller than for the two amplitude case. The survival probabilities calculation for photo and DIS $J/\Psi$ production is made in a dedicated model. In this process we show that, even though its survival probability is considerably larger than in p-p scattering, its value is below unity and cannot be neglected in the data analysis. We argue that, regardless of the uncertainties in the suggested procedure, its outcome is important both with regards to a realistic estimate of $G_{3P}$, and the survival probabilities relevant to LHC experiments. "
"It is shown that the concept of topological phase transitions can be used to design nonlinear photonic structures exhibiting power thresholds and discontinuities in their transmittance. This provides a novel route to devising nonlinear optical isolators. We study three representative designs: (i) a waveguide array implementing a nonlinear 1D Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, (ii) a waveguide array implementing a nonlinear 2D Haldane model, and (iii) a 2D lattice of coupled-ring waveguides. In the first two cases, we find a correspondence between the topological transition of the underlying linear lattice and the power threshold of the transmittance, and show that the transmission behavior is attributable to the emergence of a self-induced topological soliton. In the third case, we show that the topological transition produces a discontinuity in the transmittance curve, which can be exploited to achieve sharp jumps in the power-dependent isolation ratio. "
"We describe a technology for the fabrication of inexpensive and versatile mirrors through the use of a new type of nanoengineered optical material composed by the spreading of a self-assembling reflective colloidal film spread at the surface of a liquid. These new reflecting liquids offer interesting possibilities for astronomical instrumentation. For example, they can replace mercury in conventional rotating liquid mirrors. The main advantages offered include extremely low cost and, by coating a viscous liquid, the possibility of tilting the mirror by a few tens of degrees. We also have coated ferromagnetic liquids with these reflecting films. The resulting surfaces can be shaped by the application of a magnetic field, yielding reflecting surfaces that can have complicated shapes that can rapidly shift with time. These inexpensive and versatile optical elements could have numerous scientific and technological applications. Among possible astronomical applications, they could be used to make large inexpensive adaptive mirrors exhibiting strokes ranging from nanometers to several millimeters. "
"The SuperChic Monte Carlo generator provides a common platform for QCD-mediated, photoproduction and photon-induced Central Exclusive Production (CEP), with a fully differential treatment of soft survival effects. In these proceedings we summarise the processes generated, before discussing in more detail those due to photon-photon collisions, paying special attention to the correct treatment of the survival factor. We briefly consider the light-by-light scattering process as an example, before discussing planned extensions and refinements for the generator. "
"In order to propose a ferromagnet exhibiting highly spin-polarized transport, we theoretically analyzed the spin polarization ratio of the conductivity of the bulk Fe$_4$N with a perovskite type structure, in which N is located at the body center position of fcc-Fe. The spin polarization ratio is defined by $P = (\sigma_\uparrow - \sigma_\downarrow) / (\sigma_\uparrow + \sigma_\downarrow )$, with $\sigma_{\uparrow(\downarrow)}$ being the conductivity at zero temperature of the up spin (down spin). The conductivity is obtained by using the Kubo formula and the Slater-Koster tight binding model, where parameters are determined from the least-square fitting of the dispersion curves by the tight binding model to those by the first principles calculation. In the vicinity of the Fermi energy, $|P|$ takes almost 1.0, indicating perfectly spin-polarized transport. In addition, by comparing Fe$_4$N to fcc-Fe (Fe$_4$N$_0$) in the ferromagnetic state with the equilibrium lattice constant of Fe$_4$N, it is shown that the non-magnetic atom N plays an important role in increasing $|P|$. "
"We give a detailed derivation of the spherical harmonics which correspond to the spectrum in the tables of the 1985 paper by Kim, Romans and the author on the Kaluza-Klein dimensional reduction of IIB supergravity on $S_5$ to 5-dimensional maximal anti de Sitter supergravity. We show how all methods that have been used in the literature to obtain spectra if the internal space is $S_n$ can be derived from embedding $S_n$ in $R^{n+1}$. A crucial observation for spin 1/2 spherical harmonics is that one also needs a local Lorentz rotation if one transforms to polar or stereographic coordinates. The relation to the vector spherical harmonics of electromagnetism is also worked out. "
"We demonstrate facile optical manipulation of shape of birefringent colloidal microparticles made from liquid crystal elastomers. Using soft lithography and polymerization, we fabricate elastomeric microcylinders with weakly undulating director oriented on average along their long axes. These particles are infiltrated with gold nanospheres acting as heat transducers that allow for an efficient localized transfer of heat from a focused infrared laser beam to a submicrometer region within a microparticle. Photothermal control of ordering in the liquid crystal elastomer using scanned beams allows for a robust control of colloidal particles, enabling both reversible and irreversible changes of shape. Possible applications include optomechanics, microfluidics, and reconfigurable colloidal composites with shape-dependent self-assembly. "
"Aims. Qualitative analysis of key (but yet unappreciated) linear phenomena in stratified hydrodynamic Keplerian flows: (i) the occurrence of a vortex mode, as a consequence of strato-rotational balance, with its transient dynamics; (ii) the generation of spiral-density waves (also called inertia-gravity or $g\Omega$ waves) by the vortex mode through linear mode coupling in shear flows. Methods. Non-modal analysis of linearized Boussinesq equations written in the shearing sheet approximation of accretion disk flows. Results. It is shown that the combined action of rotation and stratification introduces a new degree of freedom -- vortex mode perturbation -- which is linearly coupled with the spiral-density waves. These two modes are jointly able to extract energy from the background flow and they govern the disk dynamics in the small-scale range. The transient behavior of these modes is determined by the non-normality of the Keplerian shear flow. Tightly leading vortex mode perturbations undergo substantial transient growth, then, becoming trailing, inevitably generate trailing spiral-density waves by linear mode coupling. This course of events -- transient growth plus coupling -- is particularly pronounced for perturbation harmonics with comparable azimuthal and vertical scales and it renders the energy dynamics similar to the 3D unbounded plane Couette flow case. Conclusions. Our investigation strongly suggests that the so-called bypass concept of turbulence, which has been recently developed by the hydrodynamic community for spectrally stable shear flows, can also be applied to Keplerian disks. This conjecture may be confirmed by appropriate numerical simulations that take in account the vertical stratification and consequent mode coupling in the high Reynolds number regime. "
"We investigate the superconducting states of the high-Tc superconductors which we argue to be commensurately locked by the tilted rigid octahedral distortion. The method is based on the analysis of the kinematics of the rigid-octahedra lattice model. The distortion modes cause the competing superconducting state of the ""s"" and ""d"" type symmetry. The vortex structure of the competing orders is analysed on the ground of the Ginzburg-Landau model. "
"In this paper, we present the strategy of Agent Madoff, which is a heuristic-based negotiation agent that won 2nd place at the Automated Negotiating Agents Competition (ANAC 2017). Agent Madoff is implemented to play the game Diplomacy, which is a strategic board game that mimics the situation during World War I. Each player represents a major European power which has to negotiate with other forces and win possession of a majority supply centers on the map. We propose a design architecture which consists of 3 components: heuristic module, acceptance strategy and bidding strategy. The heuristic module, responsible for evaluating which regions on the graph are more worthy, considers the type of region and the number of supply centers adjacent to the region and return a utility value for each region on the map. The acceptance strategy is done on a case-by-case basis according to the type of the order by calculating the acceptance probability using a composite function. The bidding strategy adopts a defensive approach aimed to neutralize attacks and resolve conflict moves with other players to minimize our loss on supply centers. "
"Secret coupling of neutrinos to a new light vector boson, $Z'$, with a mass smaller than 100 MeV is motivated within a myriad of scenarios which are designed to explain various anomalies in particle physics and cosmology. Due to the longitudinal component of the massive vector boson, the rates of three-body decay of charged mesons ($M$) such as the pion and the kaon to the light lepton plus neutrino and $Z'$ ($M \to l \nu Z'$) are enhanced by a factor of $(m_M/m_{Z'})^2$. On the other hand, the standard two body decay $M \to l \nu$ is suppressed by a factor of $(m_l/m_M)^2$ due to chirality. We show that in the case of ($M \to e \nu Z^\prime$), the enhancement of $m_M^4/m_e^2 m_{Z^\prime}^2\sim 10^8-10^{10}$ relative to two-body decay ($M \to e \nu$) enables us to probe very small values of gauge coupling for $\nu_e$. The strongest bound comes from the $R_K\equiv Br(K \to e +\nu)/Br(K \to \mu +\nu)$ measurement in the NA62 experiment. The bound can be significantly improved by customized searches for signals of three-body charged meson decay into the positron plus missing energy in the NA62 and/or PIENU data. "
"A recent study by Nakariakov et al. pointed out that the dispersion relation of MHD sausage mode oscillations has been incorrectly applied to coronal loops, neglecting the highly dispersive nature of the phase speed and the long-wavelength cutoff of the wave number. In the light of these new insights we revisit previous observations that have been interpreted in terms of MHD sausage mode oscillations in coronal loops and come to the following conclusions: (1) Fast sausage MHD mode oscillations require such a high electron density imposed by the wave number cutoff that they can only occur in flare loops; (2) In the previously reported radio observations ($\nu \approx 100$ MHz to 1 GHz) with periods of $P\approx 0.5-5$ s, the fast sausage MHD mode oscillation is likely to be confined to a small segment (corresponding to a high harmonic node) near the apex of the loop, rather than involving a global oscillation over the entire loop length. The recent microwave and soft X-ray observations of fast periods ($P\approx 6-17$ s) by Asai et al. and Melnikov et al., however, are consistent with fast sausage MHD oscillations at the fundamental harmonic. "
"We report the experimental demonstration of femtosecond electron diffraction using high-brightness MeV electron beams. High-quality, single-shot electron diffraction patterns for both polycrystalline aluminum and single-crystal 1T-TaS2 are obtained utilizing a 5 femto-Coulomb (~3x10^4 electrons) pulse of electrons at 2.8 MeV. The high quality of the electron diffraction patterns confirm that electron beam has a normalized emittance of ~50 nm-rad. The corresponding transverse and longitudinal coherence length are ~11 nm and ~2.5 nm, respectively. The timing jitter between the pump laser and probe electron beam was found to be ~ 100 fs (rms). The temporal resolution is demonstrated by observing the evolution of Bragg and superlattice peaks of 1T-TaS2 following an 800 nm optical pump and was found to be 130 fs. Our results demonstrate the advantages of MeV electron diffraction: such as longer coherent lengths, large scattering cross-section and larger signal-to-noise ratio, and the feasibility of ultimately realizing 10 fs time-resolved electron diffraction. "
"We consider an inflationary universe scenario with multiple stages of inflation. The primary inflation, which may start at the Planck epoch, is followed by secondary inflations, which include the cosmological inflation that causes the primordial density fluctuations of our universe. We point out that an initial condition for a secondary inflation is naturally realized if the e-fold number of the primary inflation is sufficiently large. "
"The undirected technique for evaluating belief networks [Jensen, et.al., 1990, Lauritzen and Spiegelhalter, 1988] requires clustering the nodes in the network into a junction tree. In the traditional view, the junction tree is constructed from the cliques of the moralized and triangulated belief network: triangulation is taken to be the primitive concept, the goal towards which any clustering algorithm (e.g. node elimination) is directed. In this paper, we present an alternative conception of clustering, in which clusters and the junction tree property play the role of primitives: given a graph (not a tree) of clusters which obey (a modified version of) the junction tree property, we transform this graph until we have obtained a tree. There are several advantages to this approach: it is much clearer and easier to understand, which is important for humans who are constructing belief networks; it admits a wider range of heuristics which may enable more efficient or superior clustering algorithms; and it serves as the natural basis for an incremental clustering scheme, which we describe. "
"We discuss error-correction properties for families of quantum low-density parity check (LDPC) codes with relative distance that tends to zero in the limit of large blocklength. In particular, we show that any family of LDPC codes, quantum or classical, where distance scales as a positive power of the block length, $d \propto n^\alpha$, $\alpha>0$, can correct all errors with certainty if the error rate per (qu)bit is sufficiently small. We specifically analyze the case of LDPC version of the quantum hypergraph-product codes recently suggested by Tillich and Z\'emor. These codes are a finite-rate generalization of the toric codes, and, for sufficiently large quantum computers, offer an advantage over the toric codes. "
"Recently, a new framework for solving the hierarchy problem has been proposed which does not rely on low energy supersymmetry or technicolor. The gravitational and gauge interactions unite at the electroweak scale, and the observed weakness of gravity at long distances is due the existence of large new spatial dimensions. In this letter, we show that this framework can be embedded in string theory. These models have a perturbative description in the context of type I string theory. The gravitational sector consists of closed strings propagating in the higher-dimensional bulk, while ordinary matter consists of open strings living on D3-branes. This scenario raises the exciting possibility that the LHC and NLC will experimentally study both ordinary aspects of string physics such as the production of narrow Regge-excitations of all standard model particles, as well more exotic phenomena involving strong gravity such as the production of black holes. The new dimensions can be probed by events with large missing energy carried off by gravitons escaping into the bulk. We finally discuss some important issues of model building, such as proton stability, gauge coupling unification and supersymmetry breaking. "
"We discuss the signatures of a representative Higgsless model with ideal fermion delocalization in vector-boson fusion processes, focusing on the gold- and silver-plated decay modes of the gauge bosons at the CERN-Large Hadron Collider. For this purpose, we have developed a fully-flexible parton-level Monte-Carlo program, which allows for the calculation of cross sections and kinematic distributions within experimentally feasible selection cuts at NLO-QCD accuracy. We find that Kaluza-Klein resonances give rise to very distinctive distributions of the decay leptons. Similar to the Standard Model case, within the Higgsless scenario the perturbative treatment of the vector-boson scattering processes is under excellent control. "
We investigate the effect of the Dzyaloshinskii Moriya interaction (DMI) on magnetic domain nucleation in a ferromagnetic thin film with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. We propose an extended droplet model to determine the nucleation field as a function of the in-plane field. The model can explain the experimentally observed nucleation in a CoNi microstrip with the interfacial DMI. The results are also reproduced by micromagnetic simulation based on the string model. The electrical measurement method proposed in this study can be widely used to quantitatively determine the DMI energy density.
"In behavioral and psychiatric research, data consisting of a per-subject proportion of ""successes"" and ""failures"" over a finite number of trials often arise. This kind of clustered binary data are usually non-normally distributed, which can cause issues with parameter estimation and predictions if the usual general linear model is applied and sample size is small. Here we studied the performances of some of the available analytic methods applicable to the analysis of proportion data; namely linear regression, Poisson regression, beta-binomial regression and Generalized Linear Mixed Models (GLMMs). We report the conclusions from a simulation study evaluating power and Type I error rates of these models in scenarios akin to those met by behavioral researchers and differing in sample size, cluster size and fixed effects parameters; plus, we describe results from the application of these methods on data from two real behavioral experiments. Our results show that, while GLMMs and beta-binomial regression are powerful instruments for the analysis of clustered binary outcomes, linear approximation can still provide reliable hypothesis testing in this context. Poisson regression, on the other hand, can suffer heavily from model misspecification when used to model proportion data. We conclude providing some guidelines for the choice of appropriate analytical instruments, sample and cluster size depending on the conditions of the experiment. "
"The realization and detection of topological phases with ultracold atomic gases is at the frontier of current theoretical and experimental research. Here, we identify cold atoms in optical ladders subjected to synthetic magnetic fields as readily realizable bridges between one-dimensional spin-orbit (time reversal) topological insulators and two-dimensional Chern insulators. We reveal three instances of their promising potential: i) they realize spin-orbit coupling, with the left-right leg degree of freedom playing the role of an effective spin, ii) their energy bands and eigenstates exactly reproduce the topological chiral edge modes of two-dimensional Chern insulators, and iii) they can be tailored to realize a topological phase transition from a trivial to a topological insulating phase. We propose realistic schemes to observe the chiral and topological properties of ladder systems with current optical lattice-based experiments. Our findings open a door to the exploration of the physics of the edges of Chern insulators and to the realization of spin-orbit coupling and topological superfluid phases with ultracold atomic gases. "
"We study thermoelectric properties of granular semiconductors with weak tunneling conductance between the grains, g_t < 1. We calculate the thermopower and figure of merit taking into account the shift of the chemical potential and the asymmetry of the density of states in the vicinity of the Fermi surface due to n- or p-type doping in the Efros-Shklovskii regime for temperatures less than the charging energy. We show that for weakly coupled semiconducting grains the figure of merit is optimized for grain sizes of order 5nm for typical materials and its values can be larger than one. We also study the case of compensated granular semiconductors and show that in this case the thermopower can be still finite, although two to three orders of magnitude smaller than in the uncompensated regime. "
"In this paper, we design and compare multilevel polar coding (MLPC) and bit-interleaved polar coded modulation (BIPCM) for uplink sparse code multiple access (SCMA) systems that operate over fast and block fading channels. Both successive cancellation (SC) and successive cancellation list (SCL) decoding algorithms are considered. Simulation results show that, with either decoder, BIPCM performs better than its MLPC counterpart. Also, both BIPCM and MLPC exhibit a performance advantage over LTE turbo-coded and WiMAX LDPC SCMA systems when the SCL technique is used for decoding. "
"Distributed optimization aims to optimize a global objective formed by a sum of coupled local convex functions over a graph via only local computation and communication. In this paper, we propose the Bregman parallel direction method of multipliers (PDMM) based on a generalized averaging step named mirror averaging. We establish the global convergence and $O(1/T)$ convergence rate of the Bregman PDMM, along with its $O(n/\ln n)$ improvement over existing PDMM, where $T$ denotes the number of iterations and $n$ the dimension of solution variable. In addition, we can enhance its performance by optimizing the spectral gap of the averaging matrix. We demonstrate our results via a numerical example. "
"Electric and magnetic characterization of NbSe2 single crystals is first presented in detail. Then, some preliminary measurements of the fluctuation-diamagnetism (FD) above the transition temperature Tc are presented. The moderate uniaxial anisotropy of this compound allowed us to observe the fluctuation effects for magnetic fields H applied in the two main crystallographic orientations. The superconducting parameters resulting from the characterization suggest that it is possible to do a reliable analysis of the FD in terms of the Ginzburg-Landau (GL) theory. "
"We report superconductivity in polycrystalline samples of the 1038-type compounds (Ca$_{1-x}$RE$_x$)$_{10}$(FeAs)$_{10}$(Pt$_3$As$_8$) up to T$_c$ = 35 K with RE = Y, La-Nd, Sm, Gd-Lu. The critical temperatures are independent of the trivalent rare earth element used, yielding an universal T$_c$($x$) phase diagram for electron doping in all these systems. The absence of superconductivity in Eu$^{2+}$ doped samples, as well as the close resemblance of (Ca$_{1-x}$RE$_x$)$_{10}$(FeAs)$_{10}$(Pt$_3$As$_8$) to the 1048 compound substantiate that the electron doping scenario in the RE-1038 and 1048 phases is completely analogous to other iron-based superconductors with simpler crystal structures.

"Magnetic nanodevices usually include a free layer whose configuration can be changed by spin-polarized current via the spin transfer effect, and a fixed reference layer. Here, we demonstrate that the roles of the free and the reference layers interchange over a small range of their relative thicknesses. Precession of both layers can be induced by spin transfer in symmetric devices, but the dynamics of one of the layers is rapidly suppressed in asymmetric devices. We interpret our results in terms of the dynamical coupling between magnetic layers due to spin transfer. "
"We calculate the potential between two static quarks in QCD using modified boundary conditions for the perturbative expansion. Through a change of the Feynman iepsilon prescription we effectively add a ""sea"" of gluons to the asymptotic states with energies below a given scale Lambda. We find that the standard result for the static potential gets corrections of order Lambda^2/Q^2 both at small and large momentum transfers Q^2. After resummation of the infrared sensitive corrections we find that the running coupling alpha_s(Q^2) freezes in the infrared and that the exchanged gluon gets an effective tachyonic mass. We verify that identical results are obtained in the Coulomb and Feynman gauges. "
"We report a search for H2O megamasers in 274 SDSS type-2 AGNs (0.3 < z < 0.83), half of which can be classified as type-2 QSOs from their [OIII] 5007 luminosity, using the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope (GBT) and the Effelsberg 100-m radio telescope. Apart from the detection of the extremely luminous water vapor megamaser SDSS J080430.99+360718.1, already reported by Barvainis & Antonucci (2005), we do not find any additional line emission. This high rate of non-detections is compared to the water maser luminosity function created from the 78 water maser galaxies known to date and its extrapolation towards the higher luminosities of ""gigamasers"" that we would have been able to detect given the sensitivity of our survey. The properties of the known water masers are summarized and discussed with respect to the nature of high-z type-2 AGNs and megamasers in general. In the appendix, we list 173 additional objects (mainly radio galaxies, but also QSOs and galaxies) that were observed with the GBT, the Effelsberg 100-m radio telescope, or Arecibo Observatory without leading to the detection of water maser emission.

"The Galactic centre - as the closest galactic nucleus - holds both intrinsic interest and possibly represents a useful analogue to star-burst nuclei which we can observe with orders of magnitude finer detail than these external systems. The environmental conditions in the GC - here taken to mean the inner 200 pc in diameter of the Milky Way - are extreme with respect to those typically encountered in the Galactic disk. The energy densities of the various GC ISM components are typically ~two orders of magnitude larger than those found locally and the star-formation rate density ~three orders of magnitude larger. Unusually within the Galaxy, the Galactic centre exhibits hard-spectrum, diffuse TeV (=10^12 eV) gamma-ray emission spatially coincident with the region's molecular gas. Recently the nuclei of local star-burst galaxies NGC 253 and M82 have also been detected in gamma-rays of such energies. We have embarked on an extended campaign of modelling the broadband (radio continuum to TeV gamma-ray), non- thermal signals received from the inner 200 pc of the Galaxy. On the basis of this modelling we find that star-formation and associated supernova activity is the ultimate driver of the region's non-thermal activity. This activity drives a large-scale wind of hot plasma and cosmic rays out of the GC. The wind advects the locally-accelerated cosmic rays quickly, before they can lose much energy in situ or penetrate into the densest molecular gas cores where star-formation occurs. The cosmic rays can, however, heat/ionize the lower density/warm H2 phase enveloping the cores. On very large scales (~10 kpc) the non-thermal signature of the escaping GC cosmic rays has probably been detected recently as the spectacular 'Fermi bubbles' and corresponding 'WMAP haze'. "
"We present a differential study of 500 Magellanic Cepheids with 3 million measurements obtained as a by-product of the EROS microlensing survey. The data-set is unbiased and provides an excellent basis for a differential analysis between LMC and SMC. We investigate the pulsational properties of the Cepheids as a function of metallicity and the constraints they give to stellar pulsation, stellar evolution theory and opacities. Moreover, our empirical analysis shows a small metallicity effect on the period-luminosity relation which has a significant implication to recent distance estimates based on HST observations of Cepheids in galaxies as far as the Virgo cluster. When the color shift of Cepheids due to metallicity is interpreted as reddening in the determination of the true distance modulus of a target galaxy a systematic error is made. Accounting for that error makes the low-H_0 values (Sandage et al.) higher and the high-H_0 (Freedman et al.) value lower, bringing those discrepant estimates into agrement around $H_0 \approx 70$ km/s Mpc^{-1}. "
"Telecom companies are severely damaged by bypass fraud or SIM boxing. However, there is a shortage of published research to tackle this problem. The traditional method of Test Call Generating is easily overcome by fraudsters and the need for more sophisticated ways is inevitable. In this work, we are developing intelligent algorithms that mine a huge amount of mobile operator's data and detect the SIMs that are used to bypass international calls. This method will make it hard for fraudsters to generate revenue and hinder their work. Also by reducing fraudulent activities, quality of service can be increased as well as customer satisfaction. Our technique has been evaluated and tested on real world mobile operator data, and proved to be very efficient. "
"Basket designs are prospective clinical trials that are devised with the hypothesis that the presence of selected molecular features determine a patient's subsequent response to a particular ""targeted"" treatment strategy. Basket trials are designed to enroll multiple clinical subpopulations to which it is assumed that the therapy in question offers beneficial efficacy in the presence of the targeted molecular profile. The treatment, however, may not offer acceptable efficacy to all subpopulations enrolled. Moreover, for rare disease settings, such as oncology wherein these trials have become popular, marginal measures of statistical evidence are difficult to interpret for sparsely enrolled subpopulations. Consequently, basket trials pose challenges to the traditional paradigm for trial design, which assumes inter-patient exchangeability. The R-package \pkg{basket} facilitates the analysis of basket trials by implementing multi-source exchangeability models. By evaluating all possible pairwise exchangeability relationships, this hierarchical modeling framework facilitates Bayesian posterior shrinkage among a collection of discrete and pre-specified subpopulations. Analysis functions are provided to implement posterior inference of the response rates and all possible exchangeability relationships between subpopulations. In addition, the package can identify ""poolable"" subsets of and report their response characteristics. The functionality of the package is demonstrated using data from an oncology study with subpopulations defined by tumor histology. "
"Diffusive shock acceleration is considered as the main mechanism for particle energization in supernova remnants, as well as in other classes of sources. The existence of some remnants that show a bilateral morphology in the X-rays and gamma rays suggests that this process occurs with an efficiency that depends upon the inclination angle between the shock normal and the large scale magnetic field in which the shock propagates. This interpretation is additionally supported by recent particle-in-cell simulations that show how ions are not injected if the shock is more oblique than $\sim 45^{o}$. These shocks provide an excellent test bench for the process of reacceleration at the same shock: non-thermal seed particles that are reached by the shock front are automatically injected and accelerated. This process was recently discussed as a possible reason for some anomalous behaviour of the spectra of secondary cosmic ray nuclei. Here we discuss how gamma--ray observations of selected supernova remnants can provide us with precious information about this process and lead us to a better assessment of particle diffusive shock reacceleration for other observables in cosmic ray physics. "
"Electrical injection of spin-polarized electrons into a semiconductor, large spin diffusion length, and an integration friendly platform are desirable ingredients for spin-based devices. Here we demonstrate lateral spin injection and detection in germanium nanowires, by using ferromagnetic metal contacts and tunnel barriers for contact resistance engineering. Using data measured from over 80 samples, we map out the contact resistance window for which lateral spin transport is observed, manifestly showing the conductivity matching required for spin injection. Our analysis, based on the spin diffusion theory, indicates that the spin diffusion length is larger than 100 {\mu}m in germanium nanowires at 4.2 K. "
"We present a systematic evaluation of the agreement between the observed radii of 90 well-characterized transiting extrasolar giant planets and their corresponding model radii. Our model radii are drawn from previously published calculations of core-less giant planets that have attained their asymptotic radii, and which have been tabulated for a range of planet masses and equilibrium temperatures. (We report a two-dimensional polynomial fitting function that accurately represents the models). As expected, the model radii provide a statistically significant improvement over a null hypothesis that the sizes of giant planets are completely independent of mass and effective temperature. As is well known, however, fiducial models provide an insufficient explanation; the planetary radius anomalies are strongly correlated with planetary equilibrium temperature. We find that the radius anomalies have a best-fit dependence, ${\cal R}\propto T_{\rm eff}^{\alpha}$, with $\alpha=1.4\pm0.6$. Incorporating this relation into the model radii leads to substantially less scatter in the radius correlation. The extra temperature dependence represents an important constraint on theoretical models for Hot Jupiters. Using simple scaling arguments, we find support for the hypothesis of Batygin and Stevenson (2010) that this correlation can be attributed to a planetary heating mechanism that is mediated by magnetohydrodynamic coupling between the planetary magnetic field and near-surface flow that is accompanied by ohmic dissipation at adiabatic depth. Additionally, we find that the temperature dependence is likely too strong to admit kinetic heating as the primary source of anomalous energy generation within the majority of the observed transiting planets.

"We define a bicomplex whose Euler characteristic is the idempotented version of the ribbon element of quantum sl(2). We show that properties of this bicomplex descend to the centrality, invertibility and symmetries of the ribbon element after decategorification. "
"We study the static dielectric function $\epsilon(q)$ of 2D electron system with spin-orbit coupling in the frame of the random phase approximation. We demonstrate that, in addition to the well-known $2k_F$-Kohn anomaly, spin-orbit coupling gives rise to the novel anomaly in the dielectric function at small $q=q_0\ll k_F$, where $q_0$ is the distance between two Fermi surfaces. As a result of this anomaly a large-distance behavior of the potential from a point charge exhibits (in addition to the conventional Friedel oscillations) novel oscillations with a period $2\pi/q_0$. The remarkable feature of these oscillations is that they are not smeared out by the temperature. We show that the small-$q$ anomaly also modifies the indirect exchange interaction of localized magnetic moments (RKKY interaction). In the presense of spin-orbit coupling this interaction acquires a high-temperature component. "
"A critical review of the very long-standing problem of the diffuse interstellar bands is presented with emphasis on spectroscopic aspects of observational, modelling and laboratory-based research. Some research themes and ideas that could be explored theoretically and experimentally are discussed. The article is based on the Journal of Molecular Spectroscopy Review Lecture presented at the 60th Ohio State University International Symposium on Molecular Spectroscopy, June 2005. "
"Supervised Learning has been successfully used to produce phase diagrams and identify phase boundaries when local order parameters are unavailable. Here, we apply unsupervised learning to this task. By using readily available clustering algorithms, we are able to extract the distinct eigenstate phases of matter within the transverse-field Ising model in the presence of interactions and disorder. We compare our results to those found through supervised learning and observe remarkable agreement. However, as opposed to the supervised procedure, our method requires no strict assumptions concerning the number of phases present, no labeled training data, and no prior knowledge of the phase diagram. We conclude with a discussion of clustering and its limits. "
"Previous luminescence and absorption experiments in Co-doped ZnO revealed two ionization and one intrashell transition of $d(\textrm{Co}^{2+})$ electrons. Those optical properties are analyzed within the generalized gradient approximation to the density functional theory. The two ionization channels involve electron excitations from the two $\textrm{Co}^{2+}$ gap states, the $t_{2\uparrow}$ triplet and the $e_{2\downarrow}$ doublet, to the conduction band. The third possible ionization channel, in which an electron is excited from the valence band to the $\textrm{Co}^{2+}$ level, requires energy in excess of 4~eV, and cannot lead to absorption below the ZnO band gap, contrary to earlier suggestions. We also consider two recombination channels, the direct recombination and a two-step process, in which a photoelectron is captured by $\textrm{Co}^{3+}$ and then recombines via the internal transition. Finally, the observed increase the band gap with the Co concentration is well reproduced by theory. The accurate description of ZnO:Co is achieved after including $+U$ corrections to the relevant orbitals of Zn, O, and Co. The $+U(\textrm{Co})$ value was calculated by the linear response approach, and independently was obtained by fitting the calculated transition energies to the optical data. The respective values, 3.4 and 3.0~eV, agree well. Ionization of Co induces large energy shifts of the gap levels, driven by the varying Coulomb coupling between the $d(\textrm{Co})$ electrons, and by large lattice relaxations around Co ions. In turn, over $\sim 1$~eV changes of $\textrm{Co}^{2+}$ levels induced by the internal transition are mainly caused by the occupation-dependent $U(\textrm{Co})$ corrections. "
"In this work, we give the wave equations of relativistic and non-relativistic quantum mechanics which are different from the Schr\""{o}dinger and Klein-Gordon equation, and we also give the new relativistic wave equation of a charged particle in an electromagnetic field "
"A simple Ising spin model which can describe the mechanism of price formation in financial markets is proposed. In contrast to other agent-based models, the influence does not flow inward from the surrounding neighbors to the center site, but spreads outward from the center to the neighbors. The model thus describes the spread of opinions among traders. It is shown via standard Monte Carlo simulations that very simple rules lead to dynamics that duplicate those of asset prices. "
We exhibit a Probabilistic Cellular Automaton (PCA) on the integers with an alphabet and a neighborhood of size 2 which is non-ergodic although it has a unique invariant measure. This answers by the negative an old open question on whether uniqueness of the invariant measure implies ergodicity for a PCA.
"In a cavity filled with a Kerr medium it is possible to generate the superposition of coherent states, i.e. Schroodinger cat states may be realized in this system. We show that such a medium may be mimicked by the propagation of a conveniently shaped Gaussian beam in a GRIN device. This is attained by introducing a second order correction to the paraxial propagation of the beam. An additional result is that a Gaussian beam propagating in GRIN media, may split into two Gaussian beams. "
"We analyze the structure of the group of (local) non-linear canonical transformations that exist in a system with n fermionic modes. To perform our study we develop an alternative framework to represent the generators of these canonical transformations; indeed we show how their definition, understanding and control is significantly improved using the Majorana fermion representation. These canonical transformations have the structure of a Lie group and we provide a representation for the elements of the Lie algebra that is very convenient both conceptually and practically (computationally): indeed our framework yields as side product an extremely effective tool to handle and work with SU(2n) Lie groups and algebras. Granting an enhanced control of the group of non-linear canonical transformation, our framework can be helpful in the study of strongly correlated electron systems, since it allows to easily identify fermionic degrees of freedom able to capture part of the correlations and thus may give a simpler representation of the Hamiltonian. Thanks to our analysis, also symmetry-based studies of the quantum Hamiltonians can be improved, since the simple representation of the generators of the canonical group permits to identify and understand otherwise hidden symmetries of difficult interpretation. The main aim of this work is to provide a comprehensive, general and scrupulous analysis of this framework, that we already applied in some circumstances. Therefore specific applications will not be presented in detail, since they can be found elsewhere, while only the formal and conceptual aspects will be developed thoroughly. "
"Let M be a finitely generated ZZ-graded module over the standard graded polynomial ring R=K[X_1, ..., X_n] with K a field, and let H_M(t)=Q_M(t)/(1-t)^d be the Hilbert series of M. We introduce the Hilbert regularity of M as the lowest possible value of the Castelnuovo-Mumford regularity for an R-module with Hilbert series H_M. Our main result is an arithmetical description of this invariant which connects the Hilbert regularity of M to the smallest k such that the power series Q_M(1-t)/(1-t)^k has no negative coefficients. Finally we give an algorithm for the computation of the Hilbert regularity and the Hilbert depth of an R-module. "
"A long standing and unverified prediction of binary star evolution theory is the existence of a population of white dwarfs accreting from sub-stellar donor stars. Such systems ought to be common, but the difficulty of finding them, combined with the challenge of detecting the donor against the light from accretion means that no donor star to date has a measured mass below the hydrogen burning limit. Here we apply a technique which allows us to reliably measure the mass of the unseen donor star in eclipsing systems. We are able to identify a brown dwarf donor star, with a mass of 0.052+/-0.002 Msun. The relatively high mass of the donor star for its orbital period suggests that current evolutionary models may underestimate the radii of brown dwarfs. "
"We study the perturbative behaviour of charged topological-AdS black holes. We calculate both analytically and numerically the quasi-normal modes of the electromagnetic and gravitational perturbations. Keeping the charge-to-mass ratio constant, we show that there is a second-order phase transition at a critical temperature at which the mass of the black hole vanishes. We pay special attention to the purely dissipative modes appearing in the spectrum as they behave singularly at the critical point. "
"We propose two new methods to address the weak scaling problems of KRR: the Balanced KRR (BKRR) and K-means KRR (KKRR). These methods consider alternative ways to partition the input dataset into p different parts, generating p different models, and then selecting the best model among them. Compared to a conventional implementation, KKRR2 (optimized version of KKRR) improves the weak scaling efficiency from 0.32% to 38% and achieves a 591times speedup for getting the same accuracy by using the same data and the same hardware (1536 processors). BKRR2 (optimized version of BKRR) achieves a higher accuracy than the current fastest method using less training time for a variety of datasets. For the applications requiring only approximate solutions, BKRR2 improves the weak scaling efficiency to 92% and achieves 3505 times speedup (theoretical speedup: 4096 times). "
"The minimum value function appearing in Tikhonov regularization technique is very useful in determining the regularization parameter, both theoretically and numerically. In this paper, we discuss the properties of the minimum value function. We also propose an efficient method to determine the regularization parameter. A new criterion for the determination of the regularization parameter is also discussed. "
"We present a probe-type scanning tunneling microscope (STM) with atomic resolution that is designed to be directly inserted and work in a harsh vibrational cryogen-free superconducting magnet system. When a commercial variable temperature insert (VTI) is installed in the magnet and the STM is in turn housed in the VTI, a lowest temperature of 1.6 K can be achieved, where the STM still operates well. We have tested it in an 8 T superconducting magnet cooled with the pulse-tube cryocooler (PTC) and obtained atomically revolved graphite and NiSe2 images as well as the scanning tunneling spectrum (STS, i.e. dI/dV spectrum) data of the latter near its critical temperature, which show the formation process of the superconducting gap as a function of temperature. The drifting rates of the STM at 1.6 K in X-Y plane and Z direction are 1.15 and 1.71 pm/min respectively. Noise analysis for the tunneling current shows that the amplitudes of the dominant peaks (6.84 and 10.25Hz) are low. This is important as a cryogen-free magnet system has long been considered too harsh for any atomic resolution measurement. "

"Recent study of a high-mobility 2D hole gas in a strained Ge quantum well revealed strong transport anisotropy in the quantum Hall regime when the magnetic field was tilted away from the sample normal. In the present study we demonstrate that the anisotropy persists to such high temperatures and filling factors that quantum oscillations are no longer observed. This finding rules out the formation of a stripe phase as a possible origin for the observed anisotropy. However, we also show that the observed anisotropy is not consistent with other known anisotropies, such as those arising from finite thickness effects or surface roughness. "
"We propose a generalization of continuous lattices and domains through the concept of enriched closure space, defined as a closure space equipped with a preclosure operator satisfying some compatibility conditions. In this framework we are able to define a notion of way-below relation; an appropriate definition of continuity then naturally follows. Characterizations of continuity of the enriched closure space and necessary and sufficient conditions for the interpolation property are proved. We also draw a link between continuity and the possibility for the subsets that are open with respect to the preclosure operator to form a topology. "
"We consider a measure of the peculiar velocity field derived from the Mark III compilation of 2900 spiral galaxies (Willick \etal 1996b), using an analysis that is substantially free of bias (Nusser and Davis 1995). We expand the velocity field in a set of orthogonal, smooth modes, reducing the data to a set of 56 coefficients fitted to a maximum redshift of 6000 km/s, and maximum spherical harmonic of l=3. Equivalent mode coefficients can be computed for the gravity field derived from any whole-sky redshift catalog of galaxies, such as the \iras 1.2 Jy survey (Fisher \etal 1995). Detailed intercomparison shows the two independent fields to be remarkably aligned in general. There are, however, systematic discrepancies in the fields that lead to coherence in the residuals between them. These residuals take the form of a dipole field in the LG frame that grows with distance; it is not consistent with a bulk flow residual. A chi-squared analysis of the mode-mode comparison designed to determine which value of $\beta\equiv \Omega^{0.6}/b$ for the \iras gravity field best fits the Mark III velocity field shows instead that no value of $\beta$ is acceptable. This is in contrast to the simulated catalogs, and suggests that there must be some systematic discrepancy between the two fields. "
"A fundamental class of problems in wireless communication is concerned with the assignment of suitable transmission powers to wireless devices/stations such that the resulting communication graph satisfies certain desired properties and the overall energy consumed is minimized. Many concrete communication tasks in a wireless network like broadcast, multicast, point-to-point routing, creation of a communication backbone, etc. can be regarded as such a power assignment problem. This paper considers several problems of that kind; for example one problem studied before in \cite{Carrots, Bilo} aims to select and assign powers to $k$ of the stations such that all other stations are within reach of at least one of the selected stations. We improve the running time for obtaining a $(1+\epsilon)$-approximate solution for this problem from $n^{((\alpha/\epsilon)^{O(d)})}$ as reported by Bilo et al. (\cite{Bilo}) to $O(n+ {(\frac{k^{2d+1}}{\epsilon^d})}^{\min{\{2k, (\alpha/\epsilon)^{O(d)} \}}})$ that is, we obtain a running time that is \emph{linear} in the network size. Further results include a constant approximation algorithm for the TSP problem under squared (non-metric!) edge costs, which can be employed to implement a novel data aggregation protocol, as well as efficient schemes to perform $k$-hop multicasts. "
"Among the members of the series R2PdSi3 (R= Rare-earths), the magnetic behavior of the Nd compound is interesting in some respects. This compound is considered to order ferromagnetically (below 16 K), unlike other members of this series which order antiferromagnetically. In addition, magnetic ordering temperature (To) is significantly enhanced with respect to de Gennes scaled value. In order to understand the magnetism of this compound better, we have investigated the magnetic behavior in detail (under external pressure as well) and also of its solid solutions based on substitutions at Nd and at Si sites, viz., on the series, Nd(2-x)(Y,La)(x)PdSi(3-y)Ge(y) (x, y= 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, and 1.2) by bulk measurements. The results overall establish that Nd2PdSi3 orders ferromagnetically below 16 K, but antiferromagnetic component seems to set in at very low temperatures. Notably, there is a significant suppression of To for Y and Ge substitutions, compared to La substitution, for a given magnitude of unit-cell volume change, however qualitatively correlating with the separation between the layers of Nd and Pd-Si(Ge). On the basis of this observation, we conclude that 4f(Nd) hybridization plays a major role on the magnetism of the former solid solutions. To our knowledge, this work serves as a rare demonstration of 4f-hybridization effects on the magnetism of a Nd-based intermetallic compound. "
"Driven by the interest of reasoning about probabilistic programming languages, we set out to study a notion of unicity of normal forms for them. To provide a tractable proof method for it, we define a property of distribution confluence which is shown to imply the desired uniqueness (even for infinite sequences of reduction) and further properties. We then carry over several criteria from the classical case, such as Newman's lemma, to simplify proving confluence in concrete languages. Using these criteria, we obtain simple proofs of confluence for $\lambda_1$, an affine probabilistic $\lambda$-calculus, and for Q$^*$, a quantum programming language for which a related property has already been proven in the literature. "
The interplay between multiscale homogenization and dimension reduction for nonlinear elastic thin plates is analyzed in the case in which the scaling of the energy corresponds to Kirchhoff's nonlinear bending theory for plates. Different limit models are deduced depending on the relative ratio between the thickness parameter $h$ and the two homogenization scales $\ep$ and $\ep^2$.
"The XENON100 experiment has recently completed a dark matter run with 100.9 live-days of data, taken from January to June 2010. Events in a 48kg fiducial volume in the energy range between 8.4 and 44.6 keVnr have been analyzed. A total of three events have been found in the predefined signal region, compatible with the background prediction of (1.8 \pm 0.6) events. Based on this analysis we present limits on the WIMP-nucleon cross section for inelastic dark matter. With the present data we are able to rule out the explanation for the observed DAMA/LIBRA modulation as being due to inelastic dark matter scattering off iodine at a 90% confidence level. "
"We extend our previous analytic existence of a symmetric periodic simultaneous binary collision orbit in a regularized fully symmetric equal mass four-body problem to the analytic existence of a symmetric periodic simultaneous binary collision orbit in a regularized planar pairwise symmetric equal mass four-body problem. We then use a continuation method to numerically find symmetric periodic simultaneous binary collision orbits in a regularized planar pairwise symmetric 1, m, 1, m four-body problem for $m$ between 0 and 1. Numerical estimates of the the characteristic multipliers show that these periodic orbits are linearly stability when $0.54\leq m\leq 1$, and are linearly unstable when $0<m\leq0.53$. "
"The unusual magnetoelectric effects observed in the multiferroic phase arising below TN=6.7K in Ba2CoGe2O7 (BCG) are related to the spontaneous toroidal moment existing in this compound. The transition to the multiferroic state, which involves spontaneous magnetization, polarization and toroidal moment gives rise to spontaneous toroidic effects. These effects produce specific contributions to the spontaneous polarization and magnetization under applied magnetic or electric fields which provide indirect indications of the existence and role of the toroidal moment in multiferroic materials. The toroidic contribution to the electric polarization in BCG is shown to result from single-ion effects. "
"We present a novel way to compute the one-loop ring-improved effective potential numerically, which avoids the spurious appearence of complex expressions and at the same time is free from the renormalization ambiguities of the self-consistent approaches, based on the direct application of Schwinger-Dyson type equations to the masses. "
"The beam splitter and phase shifter, which are the key elements in the experiments of light interference, are realized in the motion of trapped ions. Some applications, such as the creation of quantum motional states and the realization of Mach-Zehnder interferometer, are illustrated. Several detection methods of motional states used in the interferometer are also discussed. "
"This note focuses on the coupling of a type IIA D2-brane to a background B field. It is shown that the D0-brane charge arising from the integral over the D2-brane of the pullback of the B field is cancelled by bulk contributions, for a compact D2-brane wrapping a homotopically trivial cycle in space-time. In M-theory this cancellation is a straightforward consequence of momentum conservation. This result resolves a puzzle recently posed by Bachas, Douglas and Schweigert related to the quantization of R-R charges on stable spherical D2-branes on the group manifold SU(2). "
"Given a semigroup $S$ and an $n$-partition $\mathcal{P}$ of $S$, $n\in \mathbb{N}$, do there exist $A\in \mathcal{P}$ and a subset $F$ of $S$ such that $S=F ^{-1} \{x \in S: x A \bigcap A\neq\emptyset\}$ and $|F |\leq n$? We give an affirmative answer provided that either $S$ is finite or $n=2$. "
"Analyses of recent observations of the sole classical Cepheid in the Kepler field, V1154 Cygni, found random changes of about 30 minutes in the pulsation period. These period changes challenge standard theories of pulsation and evolution because the period change is non-secular, and explaining this period jitter is necessary for understanding stellar evolution and the role of Cepheids as precise standard candles. We suggest that convection and convective hot spots can explain the observed period jitter. Convective hot spots alter the timing of flux maximum and minimum in the Cepheid light curve, hence change the measured pulsation period. We present a model of random hot spots that generate a localized flux excess that perturbs the Cepheid light curve and consequently the pulsation period which is consistent with the observed jitter. This result demonstrates how important understanding convection is for modeling Cepheid stellar structure and evolution, how convection determines the red edge of the instability strip, and just how sensitive Cepheid light curves are to atmospheric physics. "
"We present the results of the dynamical analysis of the rich, hot, and X-ray very luminous galaxy cluster A2219, containing a powerful diffuse radio-halo. Our analysis is based on new redshift data for 27 galaxies in the cluster region, measured from spectra obtained at the TNG, with the addition of other 105 galaxies recovered from reduction of CFHT archive data in a cluster region of about 5 arcmin radius (about 0.8 Mpc h^-1 at the cluster distance) centered on the cD galaxy. The investigation of the dynamical status is also performed by using X-ray data stored in the Chandra archive. Further, valuable information comes from other bands - optical photometric, infrared, and radio data - which are analyzed and/or discussed, too. Our analyses support the view of the connection between extended radio emission and merging phenomena in galaxy clusters. "
"In this work, we prove that any triangle whose three sidelengths are integers, cannot have all of its three medians also having integral lengths.This is done in Proposition 2.In Section 5, we give precise(i.e.necessary and sufficient)conditions for a nonisosceles, integer-sided triangle to have two integral medians.In Section 3, we offer parametric descriptions of three special families of integer-sided triangles.The first family consists of all Pythagorean triangles whose medians to their hypotenuses is integral. The other two medians (to the two legs)of any Pythagorean triangle are irrational, a proof of this fact can be found in reference 4 of this paper.The second family consists of all integer-sided isosceles triangles, whose only integral median is the one contained between the two sides of equal length. Finally, the third family consists of all isosceles integer-sided triangles with the two medians of equal length;having integer length. "
"We show that twin building lattices have linear divergence, which implies that all asymptotic cones are without cut-points. "
"We present the results of an extensive observational study of the active star-forming complex W51 that was observed in the J=2-1 transition of the 12CO and 13CO molecules over a 1.25 deg x 1.00 deg region with the University of Arizona Heinrich Hertz Submillimeter Telescope. We use a statistical equilibrium code to estimate physical properties of the molecular gas. We compare the molecular cloud morphology with the distribution of infrared (IR) and radio continuum sources, and find associations between molecular clouds and young stellar objects (YSOs) listed in Spitzer IR catalogs. The ratios of CO lines associated with HII regions are different from the ratios outside the active star-forming regions. We present evidence of star formation triggered by the expansion of the HII regions and by cloud-cloud collisions. We estimate that about 1% of the cloud mass is currently in YSOs. "
"We use the $\zeta$-function regularization method to evaluate the finite temperature 1-loop effective potential for $\phi^4$ theory in the Godel spacetime. It is used to study the effects of temperature and curvature coupling on the cosmological phase transition in the rotational spacetime. From our results the critical temperature of symmetry restoration, which is a function of curvature coupling and magnitude of spacetime rotation, can be determined. "
"Automatically generated political event data is an important part of the social science data ecosystem. The approaches for generating this data, though, have remained largely the same for two decades. During this time, the field of computational linguistics has progressed tremendously. This paper presents an overview of political event data, including methods and ontologies, and a set of experiments to determine the applicability of deep neural networks to the extraction of political events from news text. "
"In the present paper, we propose to give an extension to the context of Dunkl theory of the notion of translation and in connection with this a corresponding extension of Taylor's formula. More precisely, we prove some properties and estimates of the integral remainder in the generalized Taylor formula associated to the Dunkl operator on the real line and we describe the Besov-type spaces for which the remainder has a given order. "
"I present an implementation of the difference image photometry based on the Alard & Lupton optimal PSF matching algorithm. The most important feature distinguishing this method from the ones using Fourier divisions is that equations are solved in real space and the knowledge of each PSF is not required for determination of the convolution kernel. I evaluate the method and software on 380 GB of OGLE-II bulge microlensing data obtained in 1997--1999 observing seasons. The error distribution is Gaussian to better than 99% with the amplitude only 17% above the photon noise limit for faint stars. Over the entire range of the observed magnitudes the resulting scatter is improved by a factor of 2--3 compared to DoPhot photometry, currently a standard tool in microlensing searches. For testing purposes the photometry of ~4600 candidate variable stars and sample difference image data are provided for BUL_SC1 field. In the candidate selection process, very few assumptions have been made about the specific types of flux variations, which makes this data set well suited for general variability studies, including the development of the classification schemes. "
"A relativistic sub-picosecond model of gravitational time delay in radio astronomical observations is worked out and a new experimental test of general relativity is discussed in which the effect of retardation of gravity associated with its finite speed can be observed. As a consequence, the speed of gravity can be measured by differential VLBI observations. Retardation in propagation of gravity is a central part of the Einstein theory of general relativity which has not been tested directly so far. The idea of the proposed gravitational experiment is based on the fact that gravity in general relativity propagates with finite speed so that the deflection of light caused by the body must be sensitive to the ratio of the body's velocity to the speed of gravity. The interferometric experiment can be performed, for example, during the very close angular passage of a quasar by Jupiter. Due to the finite speed of gravity and orbital motion of Jupiter, the variation in its gravitational field reaches observer on Earth not instantaneously but at the retarded instant of time and should appear as a velocity-dependent excess time delay in addition to the well-known Shapiro delay, caused by the static part of the Jupiter's gravitational field. Such Jupiter-QSO encounter events take place once in a decade. The next such event will occur on September 8, 2002 when Jupiter will pass by quasar J0842+1835 at the angular distance 3.7 arcminutes. If radio interferometric measurement of the quasar coordinates in the sky are done with the precision of a few picoseconds (about 5 microarcseconds) the effect of retardation of gravity and its speed of propagation may be measured with an accuracy about 10%. "
"We investigated the structure of the spherically symmetric accretion flows through the standing shock wave onto the proto-neutron star in the post-bounce phase of the collapse-driven supernova. We assume that the accretion flow is in a steady state controlled by the neutrino luminosity and mass accretion rate that are kept constant. We obtain solutions of the steady Euler equations for a wide range of neutrino luminosity and mass accretion rate. We employ a realistic EOS and neutrino-heating rates. More importantly, we take into account the effect of convection phenomenologically. For each mass accretion rate, we find the critical neutrino luminosity, above which there exists no steady solution. These critical points are supposed to mark the onset of the shock revival. As the neutrino luminosity increases for a given mass accretion rate, there appears a convectively unstable region at some point before the critical value is reached. We introduce a phenomenological energy flux by convection so that the negative entropy gradient should be canceled out. We find that the convection lowers the critical neutrino luminosity substantially. We also consider the effect of the self-gravity. It is found that the self-gravity is important only when the neutrino luminosity is high. The critical luminosity, however, is little affected if the energy transport by convection is taken into account. "
"We present algorithms and experiments for the visualization of directed graphs that focus on displaying their reachability information. Our algorithms are based on the concepts of the path and channel decomposition as proposed in the framework presented in GD 2018 (pp. 579-592) and focus on showing the existence of paths clearly. In this paper we customize these concepts and present experimental results that clearly show the interplay between bends, crossings and clarity. Additionally, our algorithms have direct applications to the important problem of showing and storing transitivity information of very large graphs and databases. Only a subset of the edges is drawn, thus reducing the visual complexity of the resulting drawing, and the memory requirements for storing the transitivity information. Our algorithms require almost linear time, $O(kn+m)$, where $k$ is the number of paths/channels, $n$ and $m$ is the number of vertices and edges, respectively. They produce progressively more abstract drawings of the input graph. No dummy vertices are introduced and the vertices of each path/channel are vertically aligned. "
"In this paper we review recent progress towards understanding the nature of quarkonia in the quark-gluon plasma. We review the theory necessary to understand the melting of bound states due to color-screening, including lattice results for the heavy quark potential, lattice results on the correlation functions related to the relevant spectral functions, and the emergence of a complex-valued potential in high-temperature quantum chromodynamics. We close with a brief survey of phenomenological models of quarkonium suppression in relativistic heavy ion collisions. "
"A permutation $\sigma$ describing the relative orders of the first $n$ iterates of a point $x$ under a self-map $f$ of the interval $I=[0,1]$ is called an \emph{order pattern}. For fixed $f$ and $n$, measuring the points $x\in I$ (according to Lebesgue measure) that generate the order pattern $\sigma$ gives a probability distribution $\mu_n(f)$ on the set of length $n$ permutations. We study the distributions that arise this way for various classes of functions $f$. Our main results treat the class of measure preserving functions. We obtain an exact description of the set of realizable distributions in this case: for each $n$ this set is a union of open faces of the polytope of flows on a certain digraph, and a simple combinatorial criterion determines which faces are included. We also show that for general $f$, apart from an obvious compatibility condition, there is no restriction on the sequence $\{\mu_n(f)\}$ for $n=1,2,...$. In addition, we give a necessary condition for $f$ to have \emph{finite exclusion type}, i.e., for there to be finitely many order patterns that generate all order patterns not realized by $f$. Using entropy we show that if $f$ is piecewise continuous, piecewise monotone, and either ergodic or with points of arbitrarily high period, then $f$ cannot have finite exclusion type. This generalizes results of S. Elizalde. "
"With the goal of investigating the degree to which theMIR luminosity in theWidefield Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) traces the SFR, we analyze 3.4, 4.6, 12 and 22 {\mu}m data in a sample of {\guillemotright} 140,000 star-forming galaxies or star-forming regions covering a wide range in metallicity 7.66 < 12 + log(O/H) < 9.46, with redshift z < 0.4. These star-forming galaxies or star-forming regions are selected by matching the WISE Preliminary Release Catalog with the star-forming galaxy Catalog in SDSS DR8 provided by JHU/MPA 1.We study the relationship between the luminosity at 3.4, 4.6, 12 and 22 {\mu}m from WISE and H\alpha luminosity in SDSS DR8. From these comparisons, we derive reference SFR indicators for use in our analysis. Linear correlations between SFR and the 3.4, 4.6, 12 and 22 {\mu}m luminosity are found, and calibrations of SFRs based on L(3.4), L(4.6), L(12) and L(22) are proposed. The calibrations hold for galaxies with verified spectral observations. The dispersion in the relation between 3.4, 4.6, 12 and 22 {\mu}m luminosity and SFR relates to the galaxy's properties, such as 4000 {\deg}A break and galaxy color. "
"We investigate two distinct sources of uncertainty in low-energy nuclear physics calculations and develop ways to account for them. Harmonic oscillator basis expansions are widely used in ab-initio nuclear structure calculations. Finite computational resources usually require that the basis be truncated before observables are fully converged, necessitating reliable extrapolation schemes. We show that a finite oscillator basis effectively imposes a hard-wall boundary condition. We accurately determine the position of the hard-wall as a function of oscillator space parameters, derive extrapolation formulas for the energy and other observables, and discuss the extension of this approach to higher angular momentum. Nucleon knockout reactions have been widely used to study and understand nuclear properties. Such an analysis implicitly assumes that the effects of the probe can be separated from the physics of the target nucleus. This factorization between nuclear structure and reaction components depends on the renormalization scale and scheme, and has not been well understood. But it is potentially critical for interpreting experiments and for extracting process-independent nuclear properties. We use similarity renormalization group (SRG) transformations to systematically study the scale dependence of factorization for the simplest knockout process of deuteron electrodisintegration. We find that the extent of scale dependence depends strongly on kinematics, but in a systematic way. Based on examination of the relevant overlap matrix elements, we are able to qualitatively explain and even predict the nature of scale dependence based on the kinematics under consideration. "
We prove the chaoticity and describe the spectral structure of Rolewicz-type weighted backward shift unbounded linear operators in the sequence spaces $l_p$ ($1\le p<\infty$) and $c_0$.
"Observational studies indicate that the intergalactic medium (IGM) is highly ionized up to redshifts just over 6. A number of models have been developed to describe the process of reionization and the effects of the ionizing photons from the first luminous objects. In this paper, we study the impact of an X-ray background, such as high-energy photons from early quasars, on the temperature and ionization of the IGM prior to reionization, before the fully ionized bubbles associated with individual sources have overlapped. X-rays, which have large mean free paths relative to EUV photons, and their photoelectrons can have significant effects on the thermal and ionization balance. We find that hydrogen ionization is dominated by the X-ray photoionization of neutral helium and the resulting secondary electrons. Thus, the IGM may have been warm and weakly ionized prior to full reionization. We examine several related consequences, including the filtering of the baryonic Jeans mass scale, signatures in the cosmic microwave background, and the H$^{-}$-catalyzed production of molecular hydrogen. "
"We describe electron spin resonance in a quantum spin liquid with significant spin-orbit coupling. We find that the resonance directly probes spinon continuum which makes it an efficient and informative probe of exotic excitations of the spin liquid. Specifically, we consider spinon resonance of three different spinon mean-field Hamiltonians, obtained with the help of projective symmetry group analysis, which model a putative quantum spin liquid state of the triangular rare-earth antiferromagnet YbMgGaO4. The band of absorption is found to be very broad and exhibit strong van Hove singularities of single spinon spectrum as well as pronounced polarization dependence. "
"In multiple testing problems, where a large number of hypotheses are tested simultaneously, false discovery rate (FDR) control can be achieved with the well-known Benjamini-Hochberg procedure, which adapts to the amount of signal present in the data. Many modifications of this procedure have been proposed to improve power in scenarios where the hypotheses are organized into groups or into a hierarchy, as well as other structured settings. Here we introduce SABHA, the ""structure-adaptive Benjamini-Hochberg algorithm"", as a generalization of these adaptive testing methods. SABHA incorporates prior information about any pre-determined type of structure in the pattern of locations of the signals and nulls within the list of hypotheses, to reweight the p-values in a data-adaptive way. This raises the power by making more discoveries in regions where signals appear to be more common. Our main theoretical result proves that SABHA controls FDR at a level that is at most slightly higher than the target FDR level, as long as the adaptive weights are constrained sufficiently so as not to overfit too much to the data-interestingly, the excess FDR can be related to the Rademacher complexity or Gaussian width of the class from which we choose our data-adaptive weights. We apply this general framework to various structured settings, including ordered, grouped, and low total variation structures, and get the bounds on FDR for each specific setting. We also examine the empirical performance of SABHA on fMRI activity data and on gene/drug response data, as well as on simulated data. "
"We present a new model of the diffuse Galactic synchrotron radiation, concentrating on its angular anisotropies. While previous studies have focussed on either the variation of the emissivity on large (kpc) scales, or on fluctuations due to MHD turbulence in the interstellar medium, we unify these approaches to match the angular power spectrum. We note that the usual turbulence cascade calculation ignores spatial correlations at the injection scale due to compression of the interstellar medium by old supernova remnants -- the 'radio loops', only four of which are visible by eye in radio maps. This new component naturally provides the otherwise missing power on intermediate and small scales in the all-sky map at 408 MHz. Our model can enable more reliable subtraction of the synchrotron foreground for studies of CMB anisotropies (both in temperature and polarisation) or searches for dark matter annihilation. We conclude with some remarks on the relevance to modelling of the polarised foreground. "
"The long gamma-ray burst (GRB) 100621A, at the time the brightest X-ray transient ever detected by Swift-XRT in the $0.3\textrm{--}10$ keV range, has been observed with the H.E.S.S. imaging air Cherenkov telescope array, sensitive to gamma radiation in the very-high-energy (VHE, $>100$ GeV) regime. Due to its relatively small redshift of $z\sim0.5$, the favourable position in the southern sky and the relatively short follow-up time ($<700 \rm{s}$ after the satellite trigger) of the H.E.S.S. observations, this GRB could be within the sensitivity reach of the H.E.S.S. instrument. The analysis of the H.E.S.S. data shows no indication of emission and yields an integral flux upper limit above $\sim$380 GeV of $4.2\times10^{-12} \rm cm^{-2}s^{-1}$ (95 % confidence level), assuming a simple Band function extension model. A comparison to a spectral-temporal model, normalised to the prompt flux at sub-MeV energies, constraints the existence of a temporally extended and strong additional hard power law, as has been observed in the other bright X-ray GRB 130427A. A comparison between the H.E.S.S. upper limit and the contemporaneous energy output in X-rays constrains the ratio between the X-ray and VHE gamma-ray fluxes to be greater than 0.4. This value is an important quantity for modelling the afterglow and can constrain leptonic emission scenarios, where leptons are responsible for the X-ray emission and might produce VHE gamma rays. "
"We derive explicit recursive formulas for Target Close (TC) and Implementation Shortfall (IS) in the Almgren-Chriss framework. We explain how to compute the optimal starting and stopping times for IS and TC, respectively, given a minimum trading size. We also show how to add a minimum participation rate constraint (Percentage of Volume, PVol) for both TC and IS. We also study an alternative set of risk measures for the optimisation of algorithmic trading curves. We assume a self-similar process (e.g. Levy process, fractional Brownian motion or fractal process) and define a new risk measure, the p-variation, which reduces to the variance if the process is a brownian motion. We deduce the explicit formula for the TC and IS algorithms under a self-similar process. We show that there is an equivalence between selfsimilar models and a family of risk measures called p-variations: assuming a self-similar process and calibrating empirically the parameter p for the p-variation yields the same result as assuming a Brownian motion and using the p-variation as risk measure instead of the variance. We also show that p can be seen as a measure of the aggressiveness: p increases if and only if the TC algorithm starts later and executes faster. Finally, we show how the parameter p of the p-variation can be implied from the optimal starting time of TC, and that under this framework p can be viewed as a measure of the joint impact of market impact (i.e. liquidity) and volatility.

"We prove a necessary and sufficient condition for an Abelian Sandpile Model (ASM) to be avalanche-finite, namely: all unstable states of the system can be brought back to stability in finite number of topplings. The method is also computationally feasible since it involves no greater than $\mbox{O} \left( N^3 \right)$ arithmetic computations where $N$ is the total number of sites of the system. Key words: Abelian sandpile model; avalanche-finiteness; self-organized criticality "
"We consider a general statistical linear inverse problem, where the solution is represented via a known (possibly overcomplete) dictionary that allows its sparse representation. We propose two different approaches. A model selection estimator selects a single model by minimizing the penalized empirical risk over all possible models. By contrast with direct problems, the penalty depends on the model itself rather than on its size only as for complexity penalties. A Q-aggregate estimator averages over the entire collection of estimators with properly chosen weights. Under mild conditions on the dictionary, we establish oracle inequalities both with high probability and in expectation for the two estimators. Moreover, for the latter estimator these inequalities are sharp. The proposed procedures are implemented numerically and their performance is assessed by a simulation study. "
"A long-duration gamma-ray burst (GRB) marks the violent end of a massive star. GRBs are rare in the universe, and their progenitor stars are thought to possess unique physical properties such as low metal content and rapid rotation, while the supernovae (SNe) that are associated with GRBs are expected to be highly aspherical. To date, it has been unclear whether GRB-SNe could be used as standardizable candles, with contrasting conclusions found by different teams. In this paper I present evidence that GRB-SNe have the potential to be used as standardizable candles, and show that a statistically significant relation exists between the brightness and width of their decomposed light curves relative to a template supernova. Every single nearby spectroscopically identified GRB-SN, for which the rest-frame and host contributions have been accurately determined, follows this relation. Additionally, it is shown that not only GRB-SNe, but perhaps all supernovae whose explosion is powered by a central engine, may eventually be used as a standardizable candle. Finally, I suggest that the use of GRB-SNe as standardizable candles likely arises from from a combination of the viewing angle and similar explosion geometry in each event, the latter which is influenced by the explosion mechanism of GRB-SNe.

"Recently, the R\'{e}nyi and Tsallis generalized entropies have extensively been used in order to study various cosmological and gravitational setups. Here, using a special type of generalized entropy, a generalization of both the R\'{e}nyi and Tsallis entropy, together with holographic principle, we build a new model for holographic dark energy. Thereinafter, considering a flat FRW universe, filled by a pressureless component and the new obtained dark energy model, the evolution of cosmos has been investigated showing satisfactory results and behavior. In our model, the Hubble horizon plays the role of IR cutoff, and there is no mutual interaction between the cosmos components. Our results indicate that the generalized entropy formalism may open a new window to become more familiar with the nature of spacetime and its properties. "
"Argon-37 is an environmental signature of an underground nuclear explosion. Producing and quantifying low-level Ar-37 standards is an important step in the development of sensitive field measurement instruments. This paper describes progress at Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in developing a process to generate and quantify low-level Ar-37 standards, which can be used to calibrate sensitive field systems at activities consistent with soil background levels. This paper presents a discussion of the measurement analysis, along with assumptions and uncertainty estimates. "
"We analyze a two-dimensional Kondo lattice model with special emphasis on non-Hermitian properties of the single-particle spectrum, following a recent proposal by Kozii and Fu. Our analysis based on the dynamical mean-field theory elucidates that the single-particle spectral weight shows the exceptional points (EPs). Correspondingly, the spectral weight exhibits the band touching, resulting in a structure similar to the ""Fermi arc"". Furthermore, we find an intriguing phenomenon arising from the periodicity of the lattice. The EPs generated by two distinct Dirac points merge and change into a hybrid point which vanishes as the exchange interaction is increased. Accordingly, the paramagnetic phase in the low temperature region shows a significant difference from non-interacting fermions: the imaginary part of the self-energy yields the ""Fermi loop"" without any defective points. "
"This precis is aimed as a practical field-guide to situations in which shear banding might be expected in complex fluids subject to an applied shear flow. Separately for several of the most common flow protocols, it summarises the characteristic signatures in the measured bulk rheological signals that suggest the presence of banding in the underlying flow field. It does so both for a steady applied shear flow, and for the time-dependent protocols of shear startup, step stress, finite strain ramp, and large amplitude oscillatory shear. An important message is that banding might arise rather widely in flows with a strong enough time-dependence, even in fluids that do not support banding in a steadily applied shear flow. This suggests caution in comparing experimental data with theoretical calculations that assume a homogeneous shear flow. In a brief postlude, we also summarise criteria in similar spirit for the onset of necking in extensional filament stretching. "
"We report numerical experiments of optical wave propagation in composites of high refractive index dielectric rods at frequencies where their first electric and magnetic Mie resonances are excited. The arrays of these particles have been extensively studied and proposed as non-absorbing and isotropic metamaterials. We show that negative refraction, observed in ordered particle arrays, is due to diffraction and that an effective medium theory yields constitutive parameters that do not reproduce the observations in these composites, whose transmission also depends on the sample shape. This is further confirmed by disordering the arrays, a case in which large transmission losses appear due to extinction by resonant scattering from the particles. Therefore, these composites although little absorbing have large extinction due to scattering. "
"We have investigated the phase transition of the gas-liquid type, with an upper critical point, in a variant of the One Component Plasma model (OCP) that has a uniform but compressible compensating background. We have calculated the parameters of the critical and triple points, spinodals, and two-phase coexistence curves (binodals). We have analyzed the connection of this simplest plasma phase transition with anomalies in the spatial charge profiles of equilibrium non-uniform plasma in the local-density approximations of Thomas-Fermi or Poisson-Boltzmann-type. "
We consider here the spin independent neutralino-proton cross section for a variety of SUGRA and D-brane models with R-parity invariance. The minimum cross section generally is >~ 1\times 10^{-(9-10)} pb (and hence accessible to future detectors) except for special regions of parameter space where it may drop to =~ 10^{-12} pb. In the latter case the gluino and squarks will be heavy (>~ 1 TeV).
"In contrast to charge vortices in a superfluid, spin vortices in a ferromagnetic condensate move inertially (if the condensate has zero magnetization along an axis). The mass of spin vortices depends on the spin-dependent interactions, and can be measured as a part of experiments on how spin vortices orbit one another. For Rb87 in a 1 micron thick trap m_v is about 10^-21 kg. "
"We report phonon renormalisation in bilayer graphene as a function of doping. The Raman G peak stiffens and sharpens for both electron and hole doping, as a result of the non-adiabatic Kohn anomaly at the $\Gamma$ point. The bilayer has two conduction and valence subbands, with splitting dependent on the interlayer coupling. This results in a change of slope in the variation of G peak position with doping, which allows a direct measurement of the interlayer coupling strength. "
"The population analysis and estimation of merger rates of compact binaries is one of the important topics in gravitational wave (GW) astronomy. The primary ingredient in these analyses is the population-averaged sensitive volume. Typically, sensitive volume, of a given search to a given simulated source population, is estimated by drawing signals from the population model and adding them to the detector data as injections. Subsequently injections, which are simulated gravitational waveforms, are searched for by the search pipelines and their signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is determined. Sensitive volume is estimated, by using Monte-Carlo (MC) integration, from the total number of injections added to the data, the number of injections that cross a chosen threshold on SNR and the astrophysical volume in which the injections are placed. So far, only fixed population models have been used in the estimation of the merger rates. However, as the scope of population analysis broaden in terms of the methodologies and source properties considered, due to an increase in the number of observed GW signals, the procedure will need to be repeated multiple times at a large computational cost. In this letter we address the problem by performing a weighted MC integration. We show how a single set of generic injections can be weighted to estimate the sensitive volume for multiple population models; thereby greatly reducing the computational cost. The weights in this MC integral are the ratios of the output probabilities, determined by the population model and standard cosmology, and the injection probability, determined by the distribution function of the generic injections. Unlike analytical/semi-analytical methods, which usually estimate sensitive volume using single detector sensitivity, the method is accurate within statistical errors, comes at no added cost and requires minimal computational resources. "
"We establish a novel bijective encoding that represents permutations as forests of decorated (or enriched) trees. This allows us to prove local convergence of uniform random permutations from substitution-closed classes satisfying a criticality constraint. It also enables us to reprove and strengthen permuton limits for these classes in a new way, that uses a semi-local version of Aldous' skeleton decomposition for size-constrained Galton--Watson trees. "
"It will be shown that for a solution of salt dissolved in water in contact with a metallic wall, the concentration of salt ions (both positive and negative) within a few Angstroms of the wall can be large enough to exceed the solubility limit of the salt, as a result of electrical image charge forces. In addition, since the dielectric constant of water increases from 2.1 at the wall to 81 at about a nanometer from a solid wall, there will be an attractive image potential near the plane on which this increase of the dielectric constant occurs. The possible existence of these image potentials suggests that the salt can be removed from the water by making salt water flow between an array of parallel solid plates.. "
"Edge computing is the practice of placing computing resources at the edges of the Internet in close proximity to devices and information sources. This, much like a cache on a CPU, increases bandwidth and reduces latency for applications but at a potential cost of dependability and capacity. This is because these edge devices are often not as well maintained, dependable, powerful, or robust as centralized server-class cloud resources. This article explores dependability and deployment challenges in the field of edge computing, what aspects are solvable with today's technology, and what aspects call for new solutions. The first issue addressed is failures, both hard (crash, hang, etc.) and soft (performance-related), and real-time constraint violation. In this domain, edge computing bolsters real-time system capacity through reduced end-to-end latency. However, much like cache misses, overloaded or malfunctioning edge computers can drive latency beyond tolerable limits. Second, decentralized management and device tampering can lead to chain of trust and security or privacy violations. Authentication, access control, and distributed intrusion detection techniques have to be extended from current cloud deployments and need to be customized for the edge ecosystem. The third issue deals with handling multi-tenancy in the typically resource-constrained edge devices and the need for standardization to allow for interoperability across vendor products. We explore the key challenges in each of these three broad issues as they relate to dependability of edge computing and then hypothesize about promising avenues of work in this area. "
"We search for low-dimensional chaotic signatures in the optical lightcurve of the $Kepler$ field blazar W2R 1926+42. The frequently used correlation integral method is employed in our analysis. We find no apparent evidence for the presence of low-dimensional chaos in the lightcurve. If further confirmed, these results could be of importance for modeling the blazar emission mechanisms. "
"Extreme floods cause casualties, widespread property damage, and damage to vital civil infrastructure. Predictions of extreme floods within gauged and ungauged catchments is crucial to mitigate these disasters. A Bayesian framework is proposed for predicting extreme floods using the generalized extreme-value (GEV) distribution. The methodological challenges consist of choosing a suitable parametrization for the GEV distribution when multiple covariates and/or latent spatial effects are involved, balancing model complexity and parsimony using an appropriate model selection procedure, and making inference based on a reliable and computationally efficient approach. We propose a latent Gaussian model with a novel multivariate link function for the location, scale and shape parameters of the GEV distribution. This link function is designed to separate the interpretation of the parameters at the latent level and to avoid unreasonable estimates of the shape parameter. Structured additive regression models are proposed for the three parameters at the latent level. Each of these regression models contains fixed linear effects for catchment descriptors. Spatial model components are added to the two first latent regression models, to model the residual spatial structure unexplained by the catchment descriptors. To achieve computational efficiency for large datasets with these richly parametrized models, we exploit a Gaussian-based approximation to the posterior density. This approximation relies on site-wise estimates, but, contrary to typical plug-in approaches, the uncertainty in these initial estimates is properly propagated through to the final posterior computations. We applied the proposed modeling and inference framework to annual peak river flow data from 554 catchments across the United Kingdom. The framework performed well in terms of flood predictions for ungauged catchments. "
"We have obtained a deep radio image with the Very Large Array at 6 cm in the Lockman Hole. The noise level in the central part of the field is about 11 microJy. From these data we have extracted a catalogue of 63 radio sources. The analysis of the radio spectral index suggests a flattening of the average radio spectra and an increase of the population of flat spectrum radio sources in the faintest flux bin. Cross correlation with the ROSAT/XMM X-ray sources list yields 13 reliable radio/X-ray associations, corresponding to about 21 per cent of the radio sample. Most of these associations (8 out of 13) are classified as Type II AGN. Using optical CCD (V and I) and K' band data we found an optical identification for 58 of the 63 radio sources. This corresponds to an identification rate of about 92 per cent, one of the highest percentages so far available. From the analysis of the colour-colour diagram and of the radio flux - optical magnitude diagram we have been able to select a subsample of radio sources whose optical counterparts are likely to be high redshift (z>0.5) early-type galaxies, hosting an Active Galactic Nucleus responsible of the radio activity. We also find evidence that at these faint radio limits a large fraction (about 60 per cent) of the faintest optical counterparts (i.e. sources in the magnitude range 22.5<I<24.5 mag) of the radio sources are Extremely Red Objects (EROs) with I-K'>4. "
"Identification and understanding of the evolution of interference patterns in two-particle momentum correlations as a function of the strength of interatomic interactions are important in explorations of the nature of quantum states of trapped particles. Together with the analysis of two-particle spatial correlations, they offer the prospect of uncovering fundamental symmetries and structure of correlated many-body states, as well as opening vistas into potential control and utilization of correlated quantum states as quantum information resources. With the use of the second-order density matrix constructed via exact diagonalization of the microscopic Hamiltonian, and an analytic Hubbard-type model, we explore here the systematic evolution of characteristic interference patterns in the two-body momentum and spatial correlation maps of two entangled ultracold fermionic atoms in a double well, for the entire attractive- and repulsive-interaction range. We uncover statistics-governed bunching and antibunching, as well as interaction-dependent interference patterns, in the ground and excited states, and interpret our results in light of the Hong-Ou-Mandel interference physics, widely exploited in photon indistinguishability testing and quantum information science. "
"We consider a parameter dependent family of damped hyperbolic equations with interesting limit behavior: the system approaches steady states exponentially fast and for parameter to zero the solutions converge to that of a parabolic limit problem. We establish sharp estimates and elaborate their dependence on the model parameters. For the numerical approximation we then consider a mixed finite element method in space together with a Runge-Kutta method in time. Due to the variational and dissipative nature of this approximation, the limit behavior of the infinite dimensional level is inherited almost automatically by the discrete problems. The resulting numerical method thus is asymptotic preserving in the parabolic limit and uniformly exponentially stable. These results are further shown to be independent of the discretization parameters. Numerical tests are presented for a simple model problem which illustrate that the derived estimates are sharp in general. "
"The BEC-BCS crossover for a NJL model with diquark interactions is studied in the presence of an external magnetic field. Particular attention is paid to different regularization schemes used in the literature. A thorough comparison of results is performed for the case of a cold and magnetized two-color NJL model. According to our results, the critical chemical potential for the BEC transition exhibits a clear inverse magnetic catalysis effect for magnetic fields in the range $ 1 \lesssim eB/m_\pi^2 \lesssim 20 $. As for the BEC-BCS crossover, the corresponding critical chemical potential is very weakly sensitive to magnetic fields up to $eB \sim 9\ m_\pi^2$, showing a much smaller inverse magnetic catalysis as compared to the BEC transition, and displays a strong magnetic catalysis from this point on. "
We continue the study the ultraviolet problem for QED in d=3 using Balaban's formulation of the renormalization group. The model is defined on a fine toroidal lattice and we seek control as the lattice spacing goes to zero. In an earlier paper the renormalization group flow was controlled with a bounded field approximation. In this paper we lay the groundwork for controlling the large field corrections. The main result in part II is an ultraviolet stability bound in a fixed finite volume.
"In an earlier paper we quantified the mean merger rate of dark matter haloes as a function of redshift z, descendant halo mass M0, and progenitor halo mass ratio xi using the Millennium simulation of the LCDM cosmology. Here we broaden that study and investigate the dependence of the merger rate of haloes on their surrounding environment. A number of local mass overdensity variables, both including and excluding the halo mass itself, are tested as measures of a halo's environment. The simple functional dependence on z, M0, and xi of the merger rate found in our earlier work is largely preserved in different environments, but we find that the overall amplitude of the merger rate has a strong positive correlation with the environmental densities. For galaxy-mass haloes, we find mergers to occur ~2.5 times more frequently in the densest regions than in voids at both z=0 and higher redshifts. Higher-mass haloes show similar trends. We present a fitting form for this environmental dependence that is a function of both mass and local density and is valid out to z=2. The amplitude of the progenitor (or conditional) mass function shows a similarly strong correlation with local overdensity, suggesting that the extended Press-Schechter model for halo growth needs to be modified to incorporate environmental effects. "
"We give the explicit structure of the functional governing the dynamical density and current fluctuations for a mesoscopic system in a nonequilibrium steady state. Its canonical form determines a generalised Onsager-Machlup theory. We assume that the system is described as a Markov jump process satisfying a local detailed balance condition such as typical for stochastic lattice gases and for chemical networks. We identify the entropy current and the traffic between the mesoscopic states as extra terms in the fluctuation functional with respect to the equilibrium dynamics. The density and current fluctuations are coupled in general, except close to equilibrium where their decoupling explains the validity of entropy production principles. "
"We prove a $q$-analog of the following result due to McKay, Morse and Wilf: the probability that a random standard Young tableau of size $n$ contains a fixed standard Young tableau of shape $\lambda\vdash k$ tends to $f^{\lambda}/k!$ in the large $n$ limit, where $f^{\lambda}$ is the number of standard Young tableaux of shape $\lambda$. We also consider the probability that a random pair $(P,Q)$ of standard Young tableaux of the same shape contains a fixed pair $(A,B)$ of standard Young tableaux. "
"We introduce a Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov mean-field approach to treat the problem of proton emission from a deformed nucleus. By substituting a rigid rotor in a particle-rotor-model with a mean-field we obtain a better description of experimental data in $^{141}$Ho. The approach also elucidates the softening of kinematic coupling between particle and collective rotation, the Coriolis attenuation problem. "
"We compare relativistic particle integrators commonly used in plasma physics showing several test cases relevant for astrophysics. Three explicit particle pushers are considered, namely the Boris, Vay, and Higuera-Cary schemes. We also present a new relativistic fully implicit particle integrator that is energy conserving. Furthermore, a method based on the relativistic guiding center approximation is included. The algorithms are described such that they can be readily implemented in magnetohydrodynamics codes or Particle-in-Cell codes. Our comparison focuses on the strengths and key features of the particle integrators. We test the conservation of invariants of motion, and the accuracy of particle drift dynamics in highly relativistic, mildly relativistic, and non-relativistic settings. The methods are compared in idealized test cases, i.e., without considering feedback on the electrodynamic fields, collisions, pair creation, or radiation. The test cases include uniform electric and magnetic fields, $\mathbf{E}\times\mathbf{B}$-fields, force-free fields, and setups relevant for high-energy astrophysics, e.g., a magnetic mirror, a magnetic dipole, and a magnetic null. These tests have direct relevance for particle acceleration in shocks and in magnetic reconnection. "
"Multi-epoch GHz Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) data of the radio-loud quasar J1101+7225 were analyzed to estimate the proper motion of extended optically thin jet components. Two components separated from the core could be mapped at 1.66 GHz, which is consistent with earlier observations. In one case we found evidence of high apparent superluminal motion (beta_app= 22.5+/-4) at large (deprojected) distances to the core (22 mas ~ 4 kpc at z= 1.46). Typically in other quasars such high separation velocities are only found much closer to the core component. Furthermore the Doppler factor, the magnetic field strength, and the angular size of the optically thick core were derived using published X-ray data. Analysis of 5 GHz VLBI data reveals the existence of further jet components within the central 5 mas. Additionally the data published so far on the GHz-spectrum were discussed at all angular resolutions. J1101+7225 turns out to be a standard quasar for studying different aspects of radio jet kinematics out to kpc-scales. "
"Most works on adversarial examples for deep-learning based image classifiers use noise that, while small, covers the entire image. We explore the case where the noise is allowed to be visible but confined to a small, localized patch of the image, without covering any of the main object(s) in the image. We show that it is possible to generate localized adversarial noises that cover only 2% of the pixels in the image, none of them over the main object, and that are transferable across images and locations, and successfully fool a state-of-the-art Inception v3 model with very high success rates. "
"Recently, a continuous dynamics was proposed to simulate dynamics of interpersonal relations in a society represented by a fully connected graph. Final state of such a society was found to be identical with the so-called Heider balance (HB), where the society is divided into two mutually hostile groups. In the continuous model, a polarization of opinions was found in HB. Here we demonstrate that the polarization occurs also in Barabasi-Albert networks, where the Heider balance is not necessarily present. In the second part of this work we demonstrate the results of our formalism, when applied to reference examples: the Southern women and the Zachary club. "
We investigate the late-time tails of self-interacting (massive) scalar fields in the spacetime of dilaton black hole. Following the no hair theorem we examine the mechanism by which self-interacting scalar hair decay. We revealed that the intermediate asymptotic behavior of the considered field perturbations is dominated by an oscillatory inverse power-law decaying tail. The numerical simulations showed that at the very late-time massive self-interacting scalar hair decayed slower than any power law.
"We derive a (2+1)-dimensional multicomponent long-wave$-$short-wave resonance interaction (LSRI) system as the evolution equation for propagation of $N$-dispersive waves in weak Kerr type nonlinear medium in the small amplitude limit. The mixed (bright-dark) type soliton solutions of a particular (2+1)-dimensional multicomponent LSRI system, deduced from the general multicomponent higher dimensional LSRI system, are obtained by applying the Hirota's bilinearization method. Particularly, we show that the solitons in the LSRI system with two short-wave components behave like scalar solitons. We point out that for $N$-component LSRI system with $N>3$, if the bright solitons appear in atleast two components, interesting collision behaviour takes place resulting in energy exchange among the bright solitons. However the dark solitons undergo standard elastic collision accompanied by a position-shift and a phase-shift. Our analysis on the mixed bound solitons shows that the additional degree of freedom which arises due to the higher dimensional nature of the system results in a wide range of parameters for which the soliton collision can take place. "
"We present the first ROSAC results of an AGN clustering analysis. This study comprises a sample of 200 AGNs, 75% of which being at low redshifts z<0.5, in the Ursa Major constellation. The spatial 2-point-correlation function (SCF) as well as the minimal spanning tree (MST) technique were applied. Some evidence for clustering is found in the SCF, although with low significance. Using the MST technique, we could find two AGN groups. This result is preliminary and the exact significance will be tested with careful simulations. "
"These lectures review the formalism of renormalization in quantum field theories with special regard to effective quantum field theories. While renormalization theory is part of every advanced course on quantum field theory, for effective theories some more advanced topics become particularly important. This includes the renormalization of composite operators, operator mixing under scale evolution, and the resummation of large logarithms of scale ratios. This course thus sets the basis for many of the more specialized lecture courses delivered at the 2017 Les Houches Summer School. "
"In the last ten years the use of proton beams in radiation therapy has become a clinical tool for treatment of deep-seated tumours. LIBO is a RF compact and low cost proton linear accelerator (SCL type) for hadrontherapy. It is conceived by TERA Foundation as a 3 GHz Linac Booster, to be mounted downstream of an existing cyclotron in order to boost the energy of the proton beam up to 200 MeV, needed for deep treatment (~25 cm) in the human body. With this solution it is possible to transform a low energy commercial cyclotron, normally used for eye melanoma therapy, isotope production and nuclear physics research, into an accelerator for deep-seated tumours. A prototype module of LIBO has been built and successfully tested with full RF power at CERN and with proton beam at INFN Laboratori Nazionali del Sud (LNS) in Catania, within an international collaboration between TERA Foundation, CERN, the Universities and INFN groups of Milan and Naples. The mid-term aim of the project is the technology transfer of the accumulated know-how to a consortium of companies and to bring this novel medical tool to hospitals. The design, construction and tests of the LIBO prototype are described in detail. "
"The MiniBooNE NCEL and CCQE cross-section measurements (neutrino running) are used to set limits in the $\Delta m^{2}-\sin^{2}\vartheta_{\mu s}$ plane for a 3+1 sterile neutrino model with a mass splitting $0.1 \leq \Delta m^{2} \leq 10.0$ eV$^{2}$. GENIE is used, with a relativistic Fermi gas model, to relate $E_{\nu}$ and the reconstructed quantities measured. The issue of uncertainty in the underlying cross-section model and its effect on the sterile neutrino limits is explored, and robust sterile neutrino limits are produced by fitting the sterile parameters and the axial-mass cross-section parameter simultaneously. "
"We construct multiple representations relative to different bases of the generalized Tschebyscheff polynomials of second kind. We build the change-of-basis matrices between the generalized Tschebyscheff of the second kind polynomial basis and Bernstein polynomial basis. Also, we provide an explicit closed from of The generalized Polynomials of degree r less than or equal n in terms of the Bernstein basis of fixed degree n. "
"Cortical network functioning critically depends on finely tuned interactions to afford neuronal activity propagation over long distances while avoiding runaway excitation. This importance is highlighted by the pathological consequences and impaired performance resulting from aberrant network excitability in psychiatric and neurological diseases, such as epilepsy. Theory and experiment suggest that the control of activity propagation by network interactions can be adequately described by a branching process. This hypothesis is partially supported by strong evidence for balanced spatiotemporal dynamics observed in the cerebral cortex, however, evidence of a causal relationship between network interactions and cortex activity, as predicted by a branching process, is missing in humans. Here we test this cause-effect relationship by monitoring cortex activity under systematic pharmacological reduction of cortical network interactions with antiepileptic drugs. We report that cortical activity cascades, presented by the propagating patterns of epileptic spikes, as well as temporal correlations decline precisely as predicted for a branching process. Our results provide the missing link to the branching process theory of cortical network function with implications for understanding the foundations of cortical excitability and its monitoring in conditions like epilepsy. "
"Let $X=(X_1,\ldots,X_n)$ be a vector of i.i.d. random variables where $X_i$'s take values over $\mathbb{N}$. The purpose of this paper is to study the number of weakly increasing subsequences of $X$ of a given length $k$, and the number of all weakly increasing subsequences of $X$. For the former, it is shown that a central limit theorem holds. Also, the first two moments of each of those two random variables are analyzed, their asymptotics are investigated, and results are related to the case of similar statistics in uniformly random permutations. We conclude the paper with applications on a similarity measure of Steele, and on increasing subsequences of riffle shuffles. "
"In this paper we study the problem of estimating innercyclic time intervals within repetitive motion sequences of top-class swimmers in a swimming channel. Interval limits are given by temporal occurrences of key-poses, i.e. distinctive postures of the body. A key-pose is defined by means of only one or two specific features of the complete posture. It is often difficult to detect such subtle features directly. We therefore propose the following method: Given that we observe the swimmer from the side, we build a pictorial structure of poselets to robustly identify random support poses within the regular motion of a swimmer. We formulate a maximum likelihood model which predicts a key-pose given the occurrences of multiple support poses within one stroke. The maximum likelihood can be extended with prior knowledge about the temporal location of a key-pose in order to improve the prediction recall. We experimentally show that our models reliably and robustly detect key-poses with a high precision and that their performance can be improved by extending the framework with additional camera views. "
"This paper presents a method to compute the {\it quasi-conformal parameterization} (QCMC) for a multiply-connected 2D domain or surface. QCMC computes a quasi-conformal map from a multiply-connected domain $S$ onto a punctured disk $D_S$ associated with a given Beltrami differential. The Beltrami differential, which measures the conformality distortion, is a complex-valued function $\mu:S\to\mathbb{C}$ with supremum norm strictly less than 1. Every Beltrami differential gives a conformal structure of $S$. Hence, the conformal module of $D_S$, which are the radii and centers of the inner circles, can be fully determined by $\mu$, up to a M\""obius transformation. In this paper, we propose an iterative algorithm to simultaneously search for the conformal module and the optimal quasi-conformal parameterization. The key idea is to minimize the Beltrami energy subject to the boundary constraints. The optimal solution is our desired quasi-conformal parameterization onto a punctured disk. The parameterization of the multiply-connected domain simplifies numerical computations and has important applications in various fields, such as in computer graphics and vision. Experiments have been carried out on synthetic data together with real multiply-connected Riemann surfaces. Results show that our proposed method can efficiently compute quasi-conformal parameterizations of multiply-connected domains and outperforms other state-of-the-art algorithms. Applications of the proposed parameterization technique have also been explored. "
"We study the free energy of a static quark in QCD with 2+1 flavors in a wide temperature region, 116 MeV $< T < $ 5814 MeV, using the highly improved staggered quark (HISQ) action. We analyze the transition region in detail, obtain the entropy of a static quark, show that it peaks at temperatures close to the chiral crossover temperature and also revisit the temperature dependence of the Polyakov loop susceptibilities using gradient flow. We discuss the implications of our findings for the deconfinement and chiral crossover phenomena at physical values of the quark masses. Finally a comparison of the lattice results at high temperatures with the weak-coupling calculations is presented. "
"Quantum mechanics gives many versions of reality but we perceive only one. One potential explanation for this, the one considered here, is that the wave function collapses down to just one version. The experimental situation is briefly reviewed, with no evidence found for collapse. The theoretical position is also reviewed and found wanting. Collapse-by-observation schemes are logically untenable. A mathematical theory of collapse must be nonlinear, a significant departure from current quantum theory. In addition, the primary candidate theory, the GRW-Pearle model, requires instantaneous, non-local transmission of information. It also requires transmission of information across versions of reality, which is forbidden in current quantum mechanics. And there is no apparent physical quantity, such as particle number, that can provide the mechanism for collapse in all cases. Further, these aspects, which are in disagreement with current theory, seem to be necessary for any mathematical theory of collapse. The conclusion is that the outlook for mathematical collapse schemes is not encouraging. "
"Machine learning is essentially the sciences of playing with data. An adaptive data selection strategy, enabling to dynamically choose different data at various training stages, can reach a more effective model in a more efficient way. In this paper, we propose a deep reinforcement learning framework, which we call \emph{\textbf{N}eural \textbf{D}ata \textbf{F}ilter} (\textbf{NDF}), to explore automatic and adaptive data selection in the training process. In particular, NDF takes advantage of a deep neural network to adaptively select and filter important data instances from a sequential stream of training data, such that the future accumulative reward (e.g., the convergence speed) is maximized. In contrast to previous studies in data selection that is mainly based on heuristic strategies, NDF is quite generic and thus can be widely suitable for many machine learning tasks. Taking neural network training with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) as an example, comprehensive experiments with respect to various neural network modeling (e.g., multi-layer perceptron networks, convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks) and several applications (e.g., image classification and text understanding) demonstrate that NDF powered SGD can achieve comparable accuracy with standard SGD process by using less data and fewer iterations.

"We argue that a finite iteration of any surface fractal can be composed of mass-fractal iterations of the same fractal dimension. Within this assertion, the scattering amplitude of surface fractal is shown to be a sum of the amplitudes of composing mass fractals. Various approximations for the scattering intensity of surface fractal are considered. It is shown that small-angle scattering (SAS) from a surface fractal can be explained in terms of power-law distribution of sizes of objects composing the fractal (internal polydispersity), provided the distance between objects is much larger than their size for each composing mass fractal. The power-law decay of the scattering intensity $I(q) \propto q^{D_{\mathrm{s}}-6}$, where $2 < D_{\mathrm{s}} < 3$ is the surface fractal dimension of the system, is realized as a non-coherent sum of scattering amplitudes of three-dimensional objects composing the fractal and obeying a power-law distribution $d N(r) \propto r^{-\tau} dr$, with $D_{\mathrm{s}}=\tau-1$. The distribution is continuous for random fractals and discrete for deterministic fractals. We suggest a model of surface deterministic fractal, the surface Cantor-like fractal, which is a sum of three-dimensional Cantor dusts at various iterations, and study its scattering properties. The present analysis allows us to extract additional information from SAS data, such us the edges of the fractal region, the fractal iteration number and the scaling factor. "
"The Internet of Things (IoT) integrates billions of smart devices that can communicate with one another with minimal human intervention. It is one of the fastest developing fields in the history of computing, with an estimated 50 billion devices by the end of 2020. On the one hand, IoT play a crucial role in enhancing several real-life smart applications that can improve life quality. On the other hand, the crosscutting nature of IoT systems and the multidisciplinary components involved in the deployment of such systems introduced new security challenges. Implementing security measures, such as encryption, authentication, access control, network security and application security, for IoT devices and their inherent vulnerabilities is ineffective. Therefore, existing security methods should be enhanced to secure the IoT system effectively. Machine learning and deep learning (ML/DL) have advanced considerably over the last few years, and machine intelligence has transitioned from laboratory curiosity to practical machinery in several important applications. Consequently, ML/DL methods are important in transforming the security of IoT systems from merely facilitating secure communication between devices to security-based intelligence systems. The goal of this work is to provide a comprehensive survey of ML /DL methods that can be used to develop enhanced security methods for IoT systems. IoT security threats that are related to inherent or newly introduced threats are presented, and various potential IoT system attack surfaces and the possible threats related to each surface are discussed. We then thoroughly review ML/DL methods for IoT security and present the opportunities, advantages and shortcomings of each method. We discuss the opportunities and challenges involved in applying ML/DL to IoT security. These opportunities and challenges can serve as potential future research directions. "
"We stacked 12CO and 13CO spectra of NGC 3627 after redefining the velocity axis of each spectrum of the mapping data so that the zero corresponds to the local mean velocity of 12CO spectra. The signal-to-noise ratios of the resulting spectra are improved by a factor of up to 3.2 compared to those obtained with normal stacking analysis. We successfully detect a weak 13CO emission from the interarm region where the emission was not detected in the individual pointings. We compare the integrated intensity ratios I12 CO/I13 CO among six characteristic regions (center, bar, bar-end, offset, arm, and interarm). We find that I12CO/I13CO in the bar and interarm are higher than those in the other regions by a factor of ~2 and I12CO/I13CO in the center is moderately high. These high I12CO/I13CO ratios in the bar and center are attributed to a high intensity ratio (T12CO/T13CO) and one in the interarm is attributed to a high ratio of the full width at half maximum of spectra (FWHM12CO/FWHM13CO). The difference between FWHM12CO and FWHM13CO of the interarm indicates the existence of two components, one with a narrow line width (~FWHM13CO) and the other with a broad line width (~FWHM12CO). Additionally, the T12CO/T13CO ratio in the broad-line-width component of the interarm is higher than the other regions. The high T12CO/T13CO in the center and bar and of the broad-line-width component in the interarm suggest the existence of non-optically thick 12CO components. We find that more than half of the 12CO emissions of the interarm are likely to be radiated from the diffuse component. Our result suggests that the use of a universal CO-to-H2 conversion factor might lead to an overestimation of molecular gas mass and underestimation of star-formation efficiency in the interarm by a factor of a few.

"We concisely review the history, physics and significance of coherent states. "
"Weak gravitational lensing is a powerful probe of cosmology and has emerged as a key probe for the Dark Universe. Up till now this science has been conducted mainly at optical wavelengths. Current upgraded and future radio facilities will provide greatly improved data that will allow lensing measurements to be made at these longer wavelengths. In this proceedings I show how the larger facilities such as the SKA can produce game changing cosmological measurements even compared to future optical telescopes. I will also discuss how radio surveys can also provide unique ways in which some of the most problematic systematic errors can be mitigated through the extra information that can be provided in the form of polarisation and rotational velocity measurements. I will also demonstrate the advantages to having overlapping optical and radio weak lensing surveys and how their cross-correlation leads to a cleaner extraction of the cosmological information. Key to the realisation of the great promise of radio weak lensing is the suitable measurements of galaxy shapes in the radio data, either from images or from the visibility data. I shall end with a description of the key issues related to this matter and the radioGREAT challenge which has been proposed to address them. "
"Let $k \in \mathbb{N}$ and $c \in \mathbb{Z}_k$, where $\mathbb{Z}_1=\mathbb{Z}$. A graph $G=(V(G),E(G))$ is said to be $c$-sum $k$-magic if there is a labeling $\ell:E(G) \rightarrow \mathbb{Z}_k \setminus \{0\}$ such that $\sum_{u \in N(v)} \ell(uv) \equiv c \pmod{k}$ for every vertex $v$ of $G$, where $N(v)$ is the neighborhood of $v$ in $G$. We say that $G$ is completely $k$-magic whenever it is $c$-sum $k$-magic for every $c \in \mathbb{Z}_k$. In this paper, we characterize all completely $k$-magic regular graphs. "
"We present a comparison between two recently developed colour reconnection models, the new colour reconnection model in PYTHIA and the DIPSY rope hadronization model. Specifically we investigate ratios of identified hadron yields as a function of the final-state activity, as measured by the charged multiplicity. Since both models have a nontrivial dependence on the final-state activity, the above observables serve as excellent probes to test the effect of these models. Both models show a clear baryon enhancement with increasing multiplicity, while only the DIPSY rope model leads to a strangeness enhancement. Flow-like patterns, previously found to be connected to colour reconnection models, are investigated for the new models. Only PYTHIA shows a $p_\perp$-dependent enhancement of the $\Lambda/K$ ratio as the final-state activity increases, with the enhancement being largest in the mid-$p_\perp$ region. "
"We present a careful recasting of first-principles band structure calculations for MgB2 in a non-orthogonal sp-tight-binding (TB) basis. Our TB results almost exactly reproduce our full potential linearized augmented plane wave results for the energy bands, the densities of states and the total energies. Our procedure generates transferable Slater-Koster parameters which should be useful for other studies of this important material. "
"Motivated by a result of Araya, we extend the Auslander-Reiten duality theorem to Cohen-Macaulay local rings. We also study the Auslander-Reiten conjecture, which is rooted in Nakayama's work on finite dimensional algebras. One of our results detects a certain condition that forces the conjecture to hold over local rings of positive depth. "
"We present the first measurement of the angular two-point correlation function for AKARI 90-$\mu$m point sources, detected outside of the Milky Way plane and other regions characterized by high Galactic extinction, and categorized as extragalactic sources according to our far-infrared-color based criterion (Pollo et al. 2010). This is the first measurement of the large-scale angular clustering of galaxies selected in the far-infrared after IRAS measurements. Although a full description of clustering properties of these galaxies will be obtained by more detailed studies, using either spatial correlation function, or better information about properties and at least photometric redshifts of these galaxies, the angular correlation function remains the first diagnostics to establish the clustering properties of the catalog and observed galaxy population. We find a non-zero clustering signal in both hemispheres extending up to $\sim 40$ degrees, without any significant fluctuations at larger scales. The observed correlation function is well fitted by a power law function. The notable differences between a northern and southern hemisphere are found, which can be probably attributed to the photometry problems and point out to a necessity of performing a better calibration in the data from southern hemisphere. "
"We present predictions of the mean multiplicity yields for different centrality classes of Pb-Pb collisions at $\sqrt{s} = 5.02$ TeV at the LHC, obtained using the Monte-Carlo Modified Glauber model (MGM) [1]. Contrary to generally used standard Glauber calculations, the MGM takes into account the energy conservation in the soft particles production. The only one efficient model parameter was tuned and fixed previously (k=0.35) by fitting the available data on multiplicity for all colliding systems up to RHIC energies. The MGM has shown already a good predictive capability for the yields at $\sqrt{s} = 2.76$ TeV, and it is used again within the same MC code for the calculations at $\sqrt{s} = 5.02$ TeV "
"A first-principles-derived approach is used to study structural, piezoelectric and dielectric properties of Pb(Zr_{1-x}Ti_{x})O_{3} (PZT) solid solutions near the morphotropic phase boundary at low temperature. Three ferroelectric phases are found to exist: a tetragonal phase for larger x compositions, a rhombohedral phase for smaller x compositions, and the recently discovered monoclinic phase in between. In this monoclinic phase, the polarization associated with the Zr atoms behaves differently from the polarization associated with the Ti atoms. As the composition x decreases, the former rotates more quickly towards the pseudo-cubic [111] direction and grows in magnitude, while the latter lags in its rotation and its magnitude shrinks. The local microscopic structure is found to deviate significantly from the average structure in these PZT alloy phases as a result of fluctuations in the directions and magnitudes of the local polarizations. The monoclinic phase is characterized by a very large piezoelectric and dielectric response. "
"Recently we have published a paper [Irgaziev, Phys. Rev. C 91, 024002 (2015)] where the $S$-matrix pole method (SMP) which is only valid for resonances has been developed to derive a new explicit expression for the asymptotic normalization coefficient (ANC), and is applied to the low-energy resonant states of nucleon$+\alpha$ and $\alpha+^{12}\rm{C}$ systems. The SMP results are compared with the effective-range expansion method (EFE) results. In the present paper the SMP and EFE plus the Pad\'e-approximation are applied to study the excited 2$^+$ resonant states of $^{8}\rm{Be}$. A contradiction is found between descriptions of the experimental phase shift data for $\alpha\alpha$ scattering and of the $^{8}\rm{Be}$ resonant energy for 2$^+$ state. Using the EFE method, we also calculate the ANC for the $^{8}\rm{Be}$ ground 0$^+$ state with a very small width. This ANC agrees well with the value calculated using the known analytical expression for narrow resonances. In addition, for the $\alpha+^{12}\rm{C}$ states1$^-$ and 3$^-$ the SMP results are compared with the Pad\'e-approximation results. We find that the Pad\'e-approximation improves a resonance width description compared with the EFE results. The EFE method is also used to calculate the ANCs for the bound $^{16}\rm{O}$ ground 0$^+$ state and for the excited 1$^-$ and 2$^+$ levels which are situated near the threshold of $\alpha+^{12}\rm{C}$ channel.

We establish system of equations for single function normalized tight frame wavelets with compact supports associated with $2\times 2$ expansive integral matrices in $L^2(\R^2)$.
"Social scientists have recently turned to analyzing text using tools from natural language processing like word embeddings to measure concepts like ideology, bias, and affinity. However, word embeddings are difficult to use in the regression framework familiar to social scientists: embeddings are are neither identified, nor directly interpretable. I offer two advances on standard embedding models to remedy these problems. First, I develop Bayesian Word Embeddings with Automatic Relevance Determination priors, relaxing the assumption that all embedding dimensions have equal weight. Second, I apply work identifying latent variable models to anchor the dimensions of the resulting embeddings, identifying them, and making them interpretable and usable in a regression. I then apply this model and anchoring approach to two cases, the shift in internationalist rhetoric in the American presidents' inaugural addresses, and the relationship between bellicosity in American foreign policy decision-makers' deliberations. I find that inaugural addresses became less internationalist after 1945, which goes against the conventional wisdom, and that an increase in bellicosity is associated with an increase in hostile actions by the United States, showing that elite deliberations are not cheap talk, and helping confirm the validity of the model.

"In this paper we consider a fundamental problem in the area of viral marketing, called T{\scriptsize ARGET} S{\scriptsize ET} S{\scriptsize ELECTION} problem. In a a viral marketing setting, social networks are modeled by graphs with potential customers of a new product as vertices and friend relationships as edges, where each vertex $v$ is assigned a threshold value $\theta(v)$. The thresholds represent the different latent tendencies of customers (vertices) to buy the new product when their friend (neighbors) do. Consider a repetitive process on social network $(G,\theta)$ where each vertex $v$ is associated with two states, active and inactive, which indicate whether $v$ is persuaded into buying the new product. Suppose we are given a target set $S\subseteq V(G)$. Initially, all vertices in $G$ are inactive. At time step 0, we choose all vertices in $S$ to become active. Then, at every time step $t>0$, all vertices that were active in time step $t-1$ remain active, and we activate any vertex $v$ if at least $\theta(v)$ of its neighbors were active at time step $t-1$. The activation process terminates when no more vertices can get activated. We are interested in the following optimization problem, called T{\scriptsize ARGET} S{\scriptsize ET} S{\scriptsize ELECTION}: Finding a target set $S$ of smallest possible size that activates all vertices of $G$. There is an important and well-studied threshold called strict majority threshold, where for every vertex $v$ in $G$ we have $\theta(v)=\lceil{(d(v) +1)/2}\rceil$ and $d(v)$ is the degree of $v$ in $G$. In this paper, we consider the T{\scriptsize ARGET} S{\scriptsize ET} S{\scriptsize ELECTION} problem under strict majority thresholds and focus on three popular regular network structures: cycle permutation graphs, generalized Petersen graphs and torus cordalis.

"We propose a novel method for the determination of the effective interaction potential between the amino acids of a protein. The strategy is based on the combination of a new optimization procedure and a geometrical argument, which also uncovers the shortcomings of any optimization procedure. The strategy can be applied on any data set of native structures such as those available from the Protein Data Bank (PDB). In this work, however, we explain and test our approach on simple lattice models, where the true interactions are known a priori. Excellent agreement is obtained between the extracted and the true potentials even for modest numbers of protein structures in the PDB. Comparisons with other methods are also discussed. "
"Restricted open-shell Hartree-Fock (ROHF) theory is formulated as a projected self-consistent unrestricted HF (UHF) model by mathematically constraining spin density eigenvalues. The resulting constrained UHF (CUHF) wave function is identical to that obtained from Roothaan's effective Fock operator. Our $\alpha$ and $\beta$ CUHF Fock operators are parameter-free and have canonical orbitals and orbital energies that are physically meaningful as in UHF, except for eliminating spin contamination. The present approach removes ambiguities in ROHF orbital energies and the non-uniqueness of methods that build upon them. We present benchmarks to demonstrate CUHF physical correctness and good agreement with experimental results. "
"This note is a very basic introduction to wavelets. It starts with an orthogonal basis of piecewise constant functions, constructed by dilation and translation. The ``wavelet transform'' maps each $f(x)$ to its coefficients with respect to this basis. The mathematics is simple and the transform is fast (faster than the Fast Fourier Transform, which we briefly explain), but approximation by piecewise constants is poor. To improve this first wavelet, we are led to dilation equations and their unusual solutions. Higher-order wavelets are constructed, and it is surprisingly quick to compute with them --- always indirectly and recursively. We comment informally on the contest between these transforms in signal processing, especially for video and image compression (including high-definition television). So far the Fourier Transform --- or its 8 by 8 windowed version, the Discrete Cosine Transform --- is often chosen. But wavelets are already competitive, and they are ahead for fingerprints. We present a sample of this developing theory. "
"The problem of estimating certain distributions over $\{0,1\}^d$ is considered here. The distribution represents a quantum system of $d$ qubits, where there are non-trivial dependencies between the qubits. A maximum entropy approach is adopted to reconstruct the distribution from exact moments or observed empirical moments. The Robbins Monro algorithm is used to solve the intractable maximum entropy problem, by constructing an unbiased estimator of the un-normalized target with a sequential Monte Carlo sampler at each iteration. In the case of empirical moments, this coincides with a maximum likelihood estimator. A Bayesian formulation is also considered in order to quantify posterior uncertainty. Several approaches are proposed in order to tackle this challenging problem, based on recently developed methodologies. In particular, unbiased estimators of the gradient of the log posterior are constructed and used within a provably convergent Langevin-based Markov chain Monte Carlo method. The methods are illustrated on classically simulated output from quantum simulators. "
"Brownian transport of self-propelled overdamped microswimmers (like Janus particles) in a two-dimensional periodically compartmentalized channel is numerically investigated for different compartment geometries, boundary collisional dynamics, and particle rotational diffusion. The resulting time-correlated active Brownian motion is subject to rectification in the presence of spatial asymmetry. We prove that ratcheting of Janus particles can be orders of magnitude stronger than for ordinary thermal potential ratchets and thus experimentally accessible. In particular, autonomous pumping of a large mixture of passive particles can be induced by just adding a small fraction of Janus particles. "
"We measured [Fe/H] and [$\alpha$/Fe] using spectral synthesis of low-resolution stellar spectroscopy for 70 individual red giant branch stars across four fields spanning the outer disk, Giant Stellar Stream (GSS), and inner halo of M31. Fields at M31-centric projected distances of 23 kpc in the halo, 12 kpc in the halo, 22 kpc in the GSS, and 26 kpc in the outer disk are $\alpha$-enhanced, with $\langle$[$\alpha$/Fe]$\rangle$ = 0.43, 0.50, 0.41, and 0.58, respectively. The 23 kpc and 12 kpc halo fields are relatively metal-poor, with $\langle$[Fe/H]$\rangle$ = $-$1.54 and $-$1.30, whereas the 22 kpc GSS and 26 kpc outer disk fields are relatively metal-rich with $\langle$[Fe/H]$\rangle$ = $-$0.84 and $-$0.92, respectively. For fields with substructure, we separated the stellar populations into kinematically hot stellar halo components and kinematically cold components. We did not find any evidence of an [$\alpha$/Fe] gradient along the high surface brightness core of the GSS between $\sim$17$-$22 kpc. However, we found tentative suggestions of a negative [$\alpha$/Fe] gradient in the stellar halo, which may indicate that different progenitor(s) or formation mechanisms contributed to the build up of the inner versus outer halo. Additionally, the [$\alpha$/Fe] distribution of the metal-rich ([Fe/H] $>$ $-$1.5), smooth inner stellar halo (r$_{\rm{proj}}$ $\lesssim$ 26 kpc) is inconsistent with having formed from the disruption of progenitor(s) similar to present-day M31 satellite galaxies. The 26 kpc outer disk is most likely associated with the extended disk of M31, where its high $\alpha$-enhancement provides support for an episode of rapid star formation in M31's disk, possibly induced by a major merger.

"This paper introduces a framework for speeding up Bayesian inference conducted in presence of large datasets. We design a Markov chain whose transition kernel uses an (unknown) fraction of (fixed size) of the available data that is randomly refreshed throughout the algorithm. Inspired by the Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC) literature, the subsampling process is guided by the fidelity to the observed data, as measured by summary statistics. The resulting algorithm, Informed Sub-Sampling MCMC (ISS-MCMC), is a generic and flexible approach which, contrary to existing scalable methodologies, preserves the simplicity of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. Even though exactness is lost, i.e. the chain distribution approximates the posterior, we study and quantify theoretically this bias and show on a diverse set of examples that it yields excellent performances when the computational budget is limited. If available and cheap to compute, we show that setting the summary statistics as the maximum likelihood estimator is supported by theoretical arguments. "
"Introduction. To assess the freshness of various products are often used measuring impedance module. But due to the structure of plant foods diagnostic value should have exactly a complex component of impedance. Article tasked with developing criteria for assessing the functional state of the products subject to a comprehensive component of the impedance. Research methodology. To determine the functional status of the fruit were measured module and phase of impedance at the three frequencies of 20, 100 and 500 kHz. Criteria for recognition of functional status determined by the dynamics of changes in the parameters of the complex impedance due to destructive processes caused by dehydration and putrefaction processes. Data processing and analysis. On the basis of experimental data obtained at three frequencies modeled frequency and phase response and their changes during losing of freshness and appearance of destructive processes. Discussion and conclusions. In fresh and stale fruit modulus and phase of the impedance at low and high frequencies have characteristic differences. But this is especially evident on the phase-frequency characteristic, which can be seen that the value of the phase with the loss of freshness at low frequency decreases and increases at high more than twice during one week. Therefore, to assess the functional state of fresh and stale products we suggest use phase portraits of phase response. "

"We embed general $f(R)$ inflationary models in minimal supergravity plus matter, a single chiral superfield $\Phi$, with or without another superfield $S$, via a Jordan frame Einstein+scalar description. In particular, inflationary models like a generalized Starobinsky one are analyzed and constraints on them are found. We also embed the related models of conformal inflation, also described as Jordan frame Einstein+scalar models, in particular the conformal inflation from the Higgs model, and analyze the inflationary constraints on them.

"One of the current opportunities for stellar atmospheric modeling is the interpretation of optical interferometric data of stars. Starting from the robust, open source ATLAS atmospheric code (Kurucz, 1979), we have developed a spherically symmetric code, SATLAS, as a new option for modeling stellar atmospheres of low gravity stars. The SATLAS code is tested against both interferometric observations of M giants by Wittkowski and collaborators, and spherically symmetric M giant NextGen models from the PHOENIX code. The SATLAS models predict interferometric visibilities that agree with the observed visibilities and with predicted visibilities, and the SATLAS atmospheric structures also agree with those from spherical PHOENIX models, with just small differences in temperature and pressure at large depths in the atmospheres.

"We present the results of a visual search for galaxy-scale gravitational lenses in nearly 7 square degrees of Hubble Space Telescope (HST) images. The dataset comprises the whole imaging data ever taken with the Advanced Camera for Surveys (ACS) in the filter F814W (I-band) up to August 31st, 2011, i.e. 6.03 square degrees excluding the field of the Cosmic Evolution Survey (COSMOS) which has been the subject of a separate visual search. In addition, we have searched for lenses in the whole Wide Field Camera 3 (WFC3) near-IR imaging dataset in all filters (1.01 square degrees) up to the same date. Our primary goal is to provide a sample of lenses with a broad range of different morphologies and lens-source brightness contrast in order estimate a lower limit to the number of galaxy-scale strong lenses in the future Euclid survey in its VIS band. Our criteria to select lenses are purely morphological as we do not use any colour or redshift information.The final candidate selection is very conservative hence leading to a nearly pure but incomplete sample. We find 49 new lens candidates: 40 in the ACS images and 9 in the WFC3 images. Out of these, 16 candidates are secure lenses owing to their striking morphology, 21 more are very good candidates, and 12 more have morphologies compatible with gravitational lensing but also compatible with other astrophysical objects. It is therefore insensitive to cosmic variance and allows to estimate the number of galaxy-scale strong lenses on the sky for a putative survey depth, which is the main result of the present work. Because of the incompleteness of the sample, the estimated lensing rates should be taken as lower limits. Using these, we anticipate that a 15 000 square degrees space survey such as Euclid will find at least 60 000 galaxy-scale strong lenses down to a limiting AB magnitude of I = 24.5 (10-sigma) or I = 25.8 (3-sigma). "
We present a comprehensive analysis of the Johnson (like) noise based classical key-distribution scheme presented by Kish [1]. We suggest two passive attack strategies that enable an adversary to gain complete knowledge of the exchanged key. The first approach exploits the transient response of the voltage difference on the transmission line after the resistors are switched and the second one exploits the finite impedance of the wire connecting the two parties.
"Electrified liquids are well known to be prone to a variety of interfacial instabilities that result in the onset of apparent interfacial singularities and liquid fragmentation. In the case of electrically conducting liquids, one of the basic models describing the equilibrium interfacial configurations and the onset of instability assumes the liquid to be equipotential and interprets those configurations as local minimizers of the energy consisting of the sum of the surface energy and the electrostatic energy. Here we show that, surprisingly, this classical geometric variational model is mathematically ill-posed irrespectively of the degree to which the liquid is electrified. Specifically, we demonstrate that an isolated spherical droplet is never a local minimizer, no matter how small is the total charge on the droplet, since the energy can always be lowered by a smooth, arbitrarily small distortion of the droplet's surface. This is in sharp contrast with the experimental observations that a critical amount of charge is needed in order to destabilize a spherical droplet. We discuss several possible regularization mechanisms for the considered free boundary problem and argue that well-posedness can be restored by the inclusion of the entropic effects resulting in finite screening of free charges.

"I provide a short review of the properties of Narrow-line Seyfert 1 (NLS1) galaxies across the electromagnetic spectrum and of the models to explain them. Their continuum and emission-line properties manifest one extreme form of Seyfert activity. As such, NLS1 galaxies may hold important clues to the key parameters that drive nuclear activity. Their high accretion rates close to the Eddington rate provide new insight into accretion physics, their low black hole masses and perhaps young ages allow us to address issues of black hole growth, their strong optical FeII emission places strong constraints on FeII and perhaps metal formation models and physical conditions in these emission-line clouds, and their enhanced radio quiteness permits a fresh look at causes of radio loudness and the radio-loud radio-quiet bimodality in AGN. "
"A procedure is developed for using Soft Collinear Effective Theory (SCET) to generate fully exclusive events, which can then be compared to data from collider experiments. We show that SCET smoothly interpolates between QCD for hard emissions, and the parton shower for soft emissions, while resumming all large logarithms. In SCET, logarithms are resummed using the renormalization group, instead of classical Sudakov factors, so subleading logarithms can be resummed as well. In addition, all loop effects of QCD can be reproduced in SCET, which allows the effective theory to incorporate next-to-leading and higher-order effects. We also show through SCET that in the soft/collinear limit, successive branchings factorize, a fact which is essential to parton showers, and that the splitting functions of QCD are reproduced. Finally, combining these results, we present a example of an algorithm that incorporates the SCET results into an event generator which is systematically improvable. "
"In this paper we investigate the class of grey Brownian motions $B_{\alpha,\beta}$ ($0<\alpha<2$, $0<\beta\leq1$). We show that grey Brownian motion admits different representations in terms of certain known processes, such as fractional Brownian motion, multivariate elliptical distribution or as a subordination. The weak convergence of the increments of $B_{\alpha,\beta}$ in $t$, $w$-variables are studied. Using the Berman criterium we show that $B_{\alpha,\beta}$ admits a $\lambda$-square integrable local time $L^{B_{\alpha,\beta}}(\cdot,I)$ almost surely ($\lambda$ Lebesgue measure). Moreover, we prove that this local time can be weak-approximated by the number of crossings $C^{B_{\alpha,\beta}^{\varepsilon}}(x,I)$, of level $x$, of the convolution approximation $B_{\alpha,\beta}^{\varepsilon}$ of grey Brownian motion.

"We prove several combinatorial properties of suffix arrays, including a characterization of suffix arrays through a bijection with a certain well-defined class of permutations. Our approach is based on the characterization of Burrows-Wheeler arrays given in [1], that we apply by reducing suffix sorting to cyclic shift sorting through the use of an additional sentinel symbol. We show that the characterization of suffix arrays for a special case of binary alphabet given in [2] easily follows from our characterization. Based on our results, we also provide simple proofs for the enumeration results for suffix arrays, obtained in [3]. Our approach to characterizing suffix arrays is the first that exploits their relationship with Burrows-Wheeler permutations. "
"Online and Early detection of gestures is crucial for building touchless gesture based interfaces. These interfaces should operate on a stream of video frames instead of the complete video and detect the presence of gestures at an earlier stage than post-completion for providing real time user experience. To achieve this, it is important to recognize the progression of the gesture across different stages so that appropriate responses can be triggered on reaching the desired execution stage. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective multi-task learning framework which models the progression of the gesture along with frame level recognition. The proposed framework recognizes the gestures at an early stage with high precision and also achieves state-of-the-art recognition accuracy of 87.8% which is closer to human accuracy of 88.4% on the NVIDIA gesture dataset in the offline configuration and advances the state-of-the-art by more than 4%. We also introduce tightly segmented annotations for the NVIDIA gesture dataset and setup a strong baseline for gesture localization for this dataset. We also evaluate our framework on the Montalbano dataset and report competitive results. "
"We determine the cells, whose existence has been announced by Ocneanu, on all the candidate nimrep graphs except $\mathcal{E}_4^{(12)}$ proposed by di Francesco and Zuber for the SU(3) modular invariants classified by Gannon. This enables the Boltzmann weights to be computed for the corresponding integrable statistical mechanical models and provide the framework for studying corresponding braided subfactors to realise all the SU(3) modular invariants as well as a framework for a new SU(3) planar algebra theory.

"Real Time Strategy (RTS) games require macro strategies as well as micro strategies to obtain satisfactory performance since it has large state space, action space, and hidden information. This paper presents a novel hierarchical reinforcement learning model for mastering Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA) games, a sub-genre of RTS games. The novelty of this work are: (1) proposing a hierarchical framework, where agents execute macro strategies by imitation learning and carry out micromanipulations through reinforcement learning, (2) developing a simple self-learning method to get better sample efficiency for training, and (3) designing a dense reward function for multi-agent cooperation in the absence of game engine or Application Programming Interface (API). Finally, various experiments have been performed to validate the superior performance of the proposed method over other state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithms. Agent successfully learns to combat and defeat bronze-level built-in AI with 100% win rate, and experiments show that our method can create a competitive multi-agent for a kind of mobile MOBA game {\it King of Glory} in 5v5 mode.

"We study the bivariate size-luminosity distribution of Lyman Break Galaxies (LBGs) selected at redshifts around 4 and 5 in GOODS and the HUDF fields. We model the size-luminosity distribution as a combination of log-normal distribution (in size) and Schechter function (in luminosity), therefore it enables a more detailed study of the selection effects. We perform extensive simulations to quantify the dropout-selection completenesses and measurement biases and uncertainties in two-dimensional size and magnitude bins, and transform the theoretical size-luminosity distribution to the expected distribution for the observed data. Using maximum-likelihood estimator (MLE), we find that the Schechter function parameters for B-dropouts are \alpha=-1.68^{+0.068}_{-0.095}, M*=-20.60^{+0.13}_{-0.17}, and \phi*=1.79^{+0.32}_{-0.52} x 10^{-3} Mpc^{-3}. The log-normal size distribution is characterized by the peak R_0=1.34^{+0.099}_{-0.108} kpc at M_{1500}=-21 mag, width \sigma_{\lnR}=0.83^{+0.046}_{-0.044}, and the slope of the size-luminosity (RL) relation \beta=0.22^{+0.058}_{-0.056}. Similarly, for V-dropouts we find \alpha=-1.74^{+0.15}_{-0.20}, M*=-20.53^{+0.24}_{-0.27}, \phi*=1.55^{+0.62}_{-0.77} x 10^{-3} Mpc}^{-3}, R_0=1.19^{+0.21}_{-0.16} kpc, \sigma_{\lnR}=0.90^{+0.15}_{-0.065}, and \beta=0.25^{+0.15}_{-0.14}. The Schechter function parameters are consistent with the values in the literature, while the size distributions are wider than expected from the angular momentum distribution of the underlying dark matter halos. The slope of the size-luminosity (RL) relation is similar to those found for local disk galaxies, but considerably shallower than local early-type galaxies. "
"In this article we study Foelner sequences for operators and mention their relation to spectral approximation problems. We construct a canonical Foelner sequence for the crossed product of a discrete amenable group $\Gamma$ with a concrete C*-algebra A with a Foelner sequence. We also state a compatibility condition for the action of $\Gamma$ on A. We illustrate our results with two examples: the rotation algebra (which contains interesting operators like almost Mathieu operators or periodic magnetic Schr\""odinger operators on graphs) and the C*-algebra generated by bounded Jacobi operators. These examples can be interpreted in the context of crossed products. The crossed products considered can be also seen as a more general frame that included the set of generalized band-dominated operators. "
We study the low angular momentum accretion of matter onto Schwarzschild or Kerr black hole using fully relativistic numerical simulations. Our aim is to include the rotation of both the gas and the black hole and the presence of the magnetic field into the picture. We compare resulting structure of transonic flow with results of 1D pseudo-Newtonian semi-analytical computations of non-magnetized flow.
"From the point of view of a programmer, the robopsychology is a synonym for the activity is done by developers to implement their machine learning applications. This robopsychological approach raises some fundamental theoretical questions of machine learning. Our discussion of these questions is constrained to Turing machines. Alan Turing had given an algorithm (aka the Turing Machine) to describe algorithms. If it has been applied to describe itself then this brings us to Turing's notion of the universal machine. In the present paper, we investigate algorithms to write algorithms. From a pedagogy point of view, this way of writing programs can be considered as a combination of learning by listening and learning by doing due to it is based on applying agent technology and machine learning. As the main result we introduce the problem of learning and then we show that it cannot easily be handled in reality therefore it is reasonable to use machine learning algorithm for learning Turing machines.

"Predictive simulation of many complex flows requires moving beyond Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) based models to representations resolving at least some scales of turbulence in at least some regions of the flow. To resolve turbulence where necessary while avoiding the cost of performing large eddy simulation (LES) everywhere, a broad range of hybrid RANS/LES methods have been developed. While successful in some situations, existing methods exhibit a number of deficiencies which limit their predictive capability in many cases of interest, for instance in many flows involving smooth wall separation. These deficiencies result from inappropriate blending approaches and resulting inconsistencies between the resolved and modeled turbulence as well as errors inherited from the underlying RANS and LES models. This work details these problems and their effects in hybrid simulations, and develops a modeling paradigm aimed at overcoming these challenges. The new approach discards typical blending approaches in favor of a hybridization strategy in which the RANS and LES model components act through separate models formulated using the mean and fluctuating velocity, respectively. Further, a forcing approach in which fluctuating content is actively transferred from the modeled to the resolved scales is introduced. Finally, the model makes use of an anisotropic LES model that is intended to represent the effects of grid anisotropy. The model is demonstrated on fully-developed, incompressible channel flow and shown to be very promising. "
"Quantum dynamics (e.g., the Schr\""odinger equation) and classical dynamics (e.g., Hamilton equations) can both be formulated in equal geometric terms: a Poisson bracket defined on a manifold. The difference between both worlds is due to the presence of extra structure in the quantum case, that leads to the appearance of the probabilistic nature of the measurements and the indetermination and superposition principles. In this paper we first show that the quantum-classical dynamics prescribed by the Ehrenfest equations can also be formulated within this general framework, what has been used in the literature to construct propagation schemes for Ehrenfest dynamics. Then, the existence of a well defined Poisson bracket allows to arrive to a Liouville equation for a statistical ensemble of Ehrenfest systems. The study of a generic toy model shows that the evolution produced by Ehrenfest dynamics is ergodic and therefore the only constants of motion are functions of the Hamiltonian. The emergence of the canonical ensemble characterized by the Boltzmann's distribution follows after an appropriate application of the principle of equal a priori probabilities to this case. This work provides the basis for extending stochastic methods to Ehrenfest dynamics. "
"(Abridged) Dust is expected to be ubiquitous in extrasolar planetary systems owing to the dynamical activity of minor bodies. Inner dust populations are, however, still poorly known because of the high contrast and small angular separation with respect to their host star. We aim to determine the level of near-infrared exozodiacal dust emission around a sample of 42 nearby main sequence stars with spectral types ranging from A to K and to investigate its correlation with various stellar parameters and with the presence of cold dust belts. We use high-precision K-band visibilities obtained with the FLUOR interferometer on the shortest baseline of the CHARA array. The calibrated visibilities are compared with the expected visibility of the stellar photosphere to assess whether there is an additional, fully resolved circumstellar emission. Near-infrared circumstellar emission amounting to about 1% of the stellar flux is detected around 13 of our 42 target stars. Follow-up observations showed that one of them (eps Cep) is associated with a stellar companion, while another one was detected around what turned out to be a giant star (kap CrB). The remaining 11 excesses found around single main sequence stars are most probably associated with hot circumstellar dust, yielding an overall occurrence rate of 28+8-6% for our (biased) sample. We show that the occurrence rate of bright exozodiacal discs correlates with spectral type, K-band excesses being more frequent around A-type stars. It also correlates with the presence of detectable far-infrared excess emission in the case of solar-type stars. This study provides new insight into the phenomenon of bright exozodiacal discs, showing that hot dust populations are probably linked to outer dust reservoirs in the case of solar-type stars. For A-type stars, no clear conclusion can be made regarding the origin of the detected near-infrared excesses. "
"Extending the usual Ginzburg-Landau theory for the random-field Ising model, the possibility of dimensional reduction is reconsidered. A renormalization group for the probability distribution of magnetic impurities is applied. New parameters corresponding to the extra $\phi^4$ coupling constants in the replica Hamiltonian are introduced. Although they do not affect the critical phenomena near the upper critical dimension, they can when dimensions are lowered. "
"Based on the invasion percolation model, a lattice model for the sweeping interface dynamics is constructed to describe the pattern forming process by a sweeping interface upon drying the water-granule mixture. The model is shown to produce labyrinthine patterns similar to those found in the experiment[Yamazaki and Mizuguchi, J. Phys. Soc. Jpn. \textbf{69} (2000) 2387]. Upon changing the initial granular density, resulting patterns undergo the percolation transition, but estimated critical exponents are different from those of the conventional percolation. Loopless structure of clusters in the patterns produced by the sweeping dynamics seems to influence the nature of the transition. "
"We present a simultaneous generalization of the well-known Karhunen-Loeve (PCA) and k-means algorithms. The basic idea lies in approximating the data with k affine subspaces of a given dimension n. In the case n=0 we obtain the classical k-means, while for k=1 we obtain PCA algorithm. We show that for some data exploration problems this method gives better result then either of the classical approaches. "
"We present a model for the evolution of the galaxy ultraviolet (UV) luminosity function (LF) across cosmic time where star formation is linked to the assembly of dark matter halos under the assumption of a mass dependent, but redshift independent, efficiency. We introduce a new self-consistent treatment of the halo star formation history, which allows us to make predictions at $z>10$ (lookback time $\lesssim500$ Myr), when growth is rapid. With a calibration at a single redshift to set the stellar-to-halo mass ratio, and no further degrees of freedom, our model captures the evolution of the UV LF over all available observations ($0\lesssim z\lesssim10$). The significant drop in luminosity density of currently detectable galaxies beyond $z\sim8$ is explained by a shift of star formation toward less massive, fainter galaxies. Assuming that star formation proceeds down to atomic cooling halos, we derive a reionization optical depth $\tau = 0.056^{+0.007}_{-0.010}$, fully consistent with the latest Planck measurement, implying that the universe is fully reionized at $z=7.84^{+0.65}_{-0.98}$. In addition, our model naturally produces smoothly rising star formation histories for galaxies with $L\lesssim L_*$ in agreement with observations and hydrodynamical simulations. Before the epoch of reionization at $z>10$ we predict the LF to remain well-described by a Schechter function, but with an increasingly steep faint-end slope ($\alpha\sim-3.5$ at $z\sim16$). Finally, we construct forecasts for surveys with \JWST~and \WFIRST and predict that galaxies out to $z\sim14$ will be observed. Galaxies at $z>15$ will likely be accessible to JWST and WFIRST only through the assistance of strong lensing magnification. "
"Given a quantum (or statistical) system with a very large number of degrees of freedom and a preferred tensor product factorization of the Hilbert space (or of a space of distributions) we describe how it can be approximated with a very low-dimensional field theory with geometric degrees of freedom. The geometric approximation procedure consists of three steps. The first step is to construct weighted graphs (we call information graphs) with vertices representing subsystems (e.g. qubits or random variables) and edges representing mutual information (or the flow of information) between subsystems. The second step is to deform the adjacency matrices of the information graphs to that of a (locally) low-dimensional lattice using the graph flow equations introduced in the paper. (Note that the graph flow produces very sparse adjacency matrices and thus might also be used, for example, in machine learning or network science where the task of graph sparsification is of a central importance.) The third step is to define an emergent metric and to derive an effective description of the metric and possibly other degrees of freedom. To illustrate the procedure we analyze (numerically and analytically) two information graph flows with geometric attractors (towards locally one- and two-dimensional lattices) and metric perturbations obeying a geometric flow equation. Our analysis also suggests a possible approach to (a non-perturbative) quantum gravity in which the geometry (a secondary object) emerges directly from a quantum state (a primary object) due to the flow of the information graphs. "
"The contribution of vortex core has been taken into account properly in constructing a torque theory for multiband superconductors. We employ the prescription of describing internal magnetic field in the vortex lattice by Hao {\it et al.} and by Yaouanc {\it et al.} to derive a torque formula as a natural extension of a preceding London theory. In marked contrast with the preceding model, our novel formula does not contain a phenomenological parameter $\eta$, which prevents us from obtaining a {\it true} upper critical field $H_{\rm c2}$ by analyzing an experimental torque curve. The parameter $\eta$ was originally introduced to take care of the uncertainty in determining the vortex core size $\xi_v$. Furthermore, we reveal that the $\eta$ value is universally scaled by anisotropy $\gamma$, magnetic field $B$, and $H_{\rm c2}$ due to field dependence of $\xi_v$. This may revitalize the single-band Kogan model in combination with a universal function $\eta(\gamma, B, H_{\rm c2})$ instead of a constant $\eta$. "
"We derive the equations that describe adsorption of diffusing particles onto a surface followed by additional surface kinetic steps before being transported across the interface. Multistage surface kinetics occurs during membrane protein insertion, cell signaling, and the infection of cells by virus particles. For example, after nonspecific binding, additional kinetic steps, such as binding of receptors and coreceptors, must occur before virus particle fusion can occur. We couple the diffusion of particles in the bulk phase with the surface kinetics and derive an effective, integro-differential boundary condition that contains a memory kernel describing the delay induced by the surface reactions. This boundary condition takes the form of a singular perturbation problem in the limit where particle-surface interactions are short-ranged. Moreover, depending on the surface kinetics, the delay kernel induces a nonmonotonic, transient replenishment of the bulk particle concentration near the interface. Our approach generalizes that of Ward and Tordai, and Diamant and Andelman, to include surface kinetics, giving rise to qualitatively new behaviors. "
"Suppose that $\tilde{G}$ is a connected reductive group defined over a field $k$, and $\Gamma$ is a finite group acting via $k$-automorphisms of $\tilde{G}$ satisfying a certain quasi-semisimplicity condition. Then the connected part of the group of $\Gamma$-fixed points in $\tilde{G}$ is reductive. We axiomatize the main features of the relationship between this fixed-point group and the pair $(\tilde{G},\Gamma)$, and consider any group $G$, not just the $\Gamma$-fixed points of $\tilde{G}$, satisfying the axioms. (In fact, the axioms do not require $\Gamma$ to act on all of $\tilde{G}$.) If both $\tilde{G}$ and $G$ are $k$-quasisplit, then we can consider their duals $\tilde{G}^*$ and $G^*$. We show the existence of and give an explicit formula for a natural map from semisimple stable conjugacy classes in $G^*(k)$ to those in $\tilde{G}^*(k)$. If $k$ is finite, then our groups are automatically quasisplit, and our result specializes to give a map from semisimple conjugacy classes in $G^*(k)$ to those in $\tilde{G}^*(k)$. Since such classes parametrize packets of irreducible representations of $G(k)$ and $\tilde{G}(k)$, one obtains a mapping of such packets. "
"We propose a distributed model predictive control approach for linear time-invariant systems coupled via dynamics. The proposed approach uses the tube MPC concept for robustness to handle the disturbances induced by mutual interactions between subsystems; however, the main novelty here is to replace the conventional linear disturbance rejection controller with a second MPC controller, as is done in tube-based nonlinear MPC. In the distributed setting, this has the advantages that the disturbance rejection controller is able to consider the plans of neighbours, and the reliance on explicit robust invariant sets is removed. "
"How far and how fast does information spread in social media? Researchers have recently examined a number of factors that affect information diffusion in online social networks, including: the novelty of information, users' activity levels, who they pay attention to, and how they respond to friends' recommendations. Using URLs as markers of information, we carry out a detailed study of retweeting, the primary mechanism by which information spreads on the Twitter follower graph. Our empirical study examines how users respond to an incoming stimulus, i.e., a tweet (message) from a friend, and reveals that %retweeting behavior is constrained by a few simple principles. the ""principle of least effort"" combined with limited attention plays a dominant role in retweeting behavior. Specifically, we observe that users retweet information when it is most visible, such as when it near the top of their Twitter stream. Moreover, our measurements quantify how a user's limited attention is divided among incoming tweets, providing novel evidence that highly connected individuals are less likely to propagate an arbitrary tweet. Our study indicates that the finite ability to process incoming information constrains social contagion, and we conclude that rapid decay of visibility is the primary barrier to information propagation online.

"The Coset Space Dimensional Reduction scheme is briefly reviewed. Then a ten-dimensional supersymmetric $E_8$ gauge theory is reduced over symmetric and non-symmetric six-dimensional coset spaces. In general a four-dimensional non-supersymmetric gauge theory is obtained in case the used coset space is symmetric, while a softly broken supersymmetric gauge theory is obtained if the used coset space is non-symmetric. In the process of exhibiting the above properties we also present two attractive models, worth exploiting further, which lead to interesting GUTs with three families in four dimensions. "
We consider symbolic flows over finite alphabets and study certain kinds of repetitions in these sequences. Positive and negative results for the existence of such repetitions are given for codings of interval exchange transformations and codings of quadratic polynomials.
"Stochastic integration w.r.t. fractional Brownian motion (fBm) has raised strong interest in recent years, motivated in particular by applications in finance and Internet traffic modelling. Since fBm is not a semi-martingale, stochastic integration requires specific developments. Multifractional Brownian motion (mBm) is a Gaussian process that generalizes fBm by letting the local H\""older exponent vary in time. This is useful in various areas, including financial modelling and biomedicine. In this work we start from the fact, established in \cite[Thm 2.1.(i)]{fBm_to_mBm_HerbinLebovitsVehel}, that an mBm may be approximated, in law, by a sequence of ""tangent"" fBms. We used this result to show how one can define a stochastic integral w.r.t. mBm from the stochastic integral w.r.t. fBm, defined in \cite{Ben1}, in the White Noise Theory sense. "
"This paper concerns electromagnetic 3D subsurface imaging in connection with sparsity of signal sources. We explored an imaging approach that can be implemented in situations that allow obtaining a large amount of data over a surface or a set of orbits but at the same time require sparsity of the signal sources. Characteristic to such a tomography scenario is that it necessitates the inversion technique to be genuinely three-dimensional: For example, slicing is not possible due to the low number of sources. Here, we primarily focused on astrophysical subsurface exploration purposes. As an example target of our numerical experiments we used a synthetic small planetary object containing three inclusions, e.g. voids, of the size of the wavelength. A tetrahedral arrangement of source positions was used, it being the simplest symmetric point configuration in 3D. Our results suggest that somewhat reliable inversion results can be produced within the present a priori assumptions, if the data can be recorded at a specific resolution. This is valuable early-stage knowledge especially for design of future planetary missions in which the payload needs to be minimized, and potentially also for the development of other lightweight subsurface inspection systems.

"We study analytic descriptions of conformal immersions of the Riemann sphere S^2 into the CP^(N-1) sigma model. In particular, an explicit expression for two-dimensional (2-D) surfaces, obtained from the generalized Weierstrass formula, is given. It is also demonstrated that these surfaces coincide with the ones obtained from the Sym-Tafel formula. These two approaches correspond to parametrizations of one and the same surface in R^(N^2-1). "
"We present the construction of molecular force fields for small molecules (less than 25 atoms) using the recently developed symmetrized gradient-domain machine learning (sGDML) approach [Chmiela et al., Nat. Commun. 9, 3887 (2018); Sci. Adv. 3, e1603015 (2017)]. This approach is able to accurately reconstruct complex high-dimensional potential-energy surfaces from just a few 100s of molecular conformations extracted from ab initio molecular dynamics trajectories. The data efficiency of the sGDML approach implies that atomic forces for these conformations can be computed with high-level wavefunction-based approaches, such as the ""gold standard"" CCSD(T) method. We demonstrate that the flexible nature of the sGDML model recovers local and non-local electronic interactions (e.g. H-bonding, proton transfer, lone pairs, changes in hybridization states, steric repulsion and $n\to\pi^*$ interactions) without imposing any restriction on the nature of interatomic potentials. The analysis of sGDML molecular dynamics trajectories yields new qualitative insights into dynamics and spectroscopy of small molecules close to spectroscopic accuracy. "
"If the causality condition [the speed of sound always remains less than that of light in vacuum, i. e., $v \leq c = 1$] is imposed on the spheres of homogeneous energy density, the `ratio of the specific heats', $\gamma \leq 2.59457$, constraints the compaction parameter, $u [\equiv (M/a)$, mass to size ratio in geometrized units] of the dynamically stable configurations $ \leq 0.34056 $ [corresponding to a surface redshift $(z_a) \leq 0.771$]. Apparently, The maximum value of $u$ obtained in this manner belongs to an absolute upper bound, and gives: (i) The maximum value for static neutron star masses as $5.4 M_\odot$, if we substitute the density at the surface of the configuration equal to the average nuclear density, $E = 2 \times 10^{14}$ g cm$^{-3}$ [e.g. {\it Nature}, {\bf 259}, 377 (1976)]. (ii) However, if the density of the static configuration is constrained to the value $1.072 \times 10^{14}$ g cm$^{-3}$, by imposing the empirical result that the minimum rotation period of the fastest rotating pulsar known to date, PSR 1937 + 21, is 1.558 ms, the maximum mass value for static neutron stars exceed upto $7.4 M_\odot$. These masses have important implications for the massive compact objects like Cyg X-1, Cyg XR-1, and LMC-X3 etc., which may not, necessarily, represent black holes. (iii) The minimum rotation periods for a static $1.442 M_\odot$ neutron star to be 0.3041 ms. (iv) A suitable stable model of ultra-compact objects [$u > (1/3)$] which has important astrophysical significance. "
"In this paper we characterize the validity of the Hardy-type inequality \begin{equation*} \left\|\left\|\int_s^{\infty}h(z)dz\right\|_{p,u,(0,t)}\right\|_{q,w,\infty}\leq c \,\|h\|_{1,v,\infty} \end{equation*} where $0<p< \infty$, $0<q\leq +\infty$, $u$, $w$ and $v$ are weight functions on $(0,\infty)$. It is pointed out that this characterization can be used to obtain new characterizations for the boundedness between weighted Lebesgue spaces for Hardy-type operators restricted to the cone of monotone functions and for the generalized Stieltjes operator. "
"This paper proposes the $\rm{M}^{\rm X}/\rm{G}/1$ queueing model to represent arrivals of segmented packets when message segmentations occur. This queueing model enables us to derive the closed form of mean response time, given payload size, message size distribution and message arrival rate. From a numerical result, we show that the mean response time is more convex in payload sizes if message arrival rate is larger in a scenario where Web objects are delivered over a physical link. "
"Differential Evolution (DE) is one of the most successful and powerful evolutionary algorithms for global optimization problem. The most important operator in this algorithm is mutation operator which parents are selected randomly to participate in it. Recently, numerous papers are tried to make this operator more intelligent by selection of parents for mutation intelligently. The intelligent selection for mutation vectors is performed by applying design space (also known as decision space) criterion or fitness space criterion, however, in both cases, half of valuable information of the problem space is disregarded. In this article, a Universal Differential Evolution (UDE) is proposed which takes advantage of both design and fitness spaces criteria for intelligent selection of mutation vectors. The experimental analysis on UDE are performed on CEC2005 benchmarks and the results stated that UDE significantly improved the performance of differential evolution in comparison with other methods that only use one criterion for intelligent selection. "
"We combine new sensitive, wide-field CO data from the HERACLES survey with ultraviolet and infrared data from GALEX and Spitzer to compare the surface densities of H2, Sigma_H2, and recent star formation rate, Sigma_SFR, over many thousands of positions in 30 nearby disk galaxies. We more than quadruple the size of the galaxy sample compared to previous work and include targets with a wide range of galaxy properties. Even though the disk galaxies in this study span a wide range of properties, we find a strong and approximately linear correlation between Sigma_SFR and Sigma_H2 at our common resolution of 1kpc. This implies a roughly constant median H2 consumption time, tau_H2 = Sigma_H2 / Sigma_SFR, of ~2.35Gyr (including heavy elements) across our sample. At 1kpc resolution, there is only a weak correlation between Sigma_H2 and tau_H2 over the range Sigma_H2~5-100M_sun/pc^2, which is probed by our data. We compile a broad set of literature measurements that have been obtained using a variety of star formation tracers, sampling schemes and physical scales and show that overall, these data yield almost exactly the same results, although with more scatter. We interpret these results as strong, albeit indirect evidence that star formation proceeds in a uniform way in giant molecular clouds in the disks of spiral galaxies. "
"Kaleu is an independent, true phase space generator. After providing it with some information about the field theory and the particular multi-particle scattering process under consideration, it returns importance sampled random phase space points. Providing it also with the total weight of each generated phase space point, it further adapts to the integration problem on the fly. It is written in Fortran, such that it can independently deal with several scattering processes in parallel. "
"We present atmospheric parameters for about 300 stars of different chemical composition, whose spectra will be used to study the galactic enrichment of Fe and light elements. These parameters were derived using an homogenous iterative procedure, which considers new calibrations of colour-\teff\ relations for F, G and K-type stars based on Infrared Flux Method (IRFM) and interferometric diameters for population~I stars, and the Kurucz (1992) model atmospheres. We found that these calibrations yield a self-consistent set of atmospheric parameters for \teff$>4400$~K, representing a clear improvement over results obtained with older model atmospheres. Using this \teff-scale and Fe equilibrium of ionization, we obtained very low gravities (implying luminosities incompatible with that expected for RGB stars) for metal-poor stars cooler than 4400~K; this might be due either to a moderate Fe overionization (expected from statistical equilibrium calculations) or to inadequacy of Kurucz models to describe the atmospheres of very cool giants. Our \teff\ scale is compared with other scales recently used for metal-poor stars; it agrees well with those obtained using Kurucz (1992) models, but it gives much larger \teff's than those obtained using OSMARCS models (Edvardsson et al. 1993). This difference is attributed to the different treatment of convection in the two sets of models. For the Sun, the Kurucz (1992) model appears to be preferable to the OSMARCS ones because it better predicts the solar limb darkening; furthermore, we find that our photometric \teff's for metal-poor stars agree well with both direct estimates based on the IRFM, and with \teff's derived from H$\alpha$\ wings when using Kurucz models. "
"Fetal ECG (FECG) telemonitoring is an important branch in telemedicine. The design of a telemonitoring system via a wireless body-area network with low energy consumption for ambulatory use is highly desirable. As an emerging technique, compressed sensing (CS) shows great promise in compressing/reconstructing data with low energy consumption. However, due to some specific characteristics of raw FECG recordings such as non-sparsity and strong noise contamination, current CS algorithms generally fail in this application. This work proposes to use the block sparse Bayesian learning (BSBL) framework to compress/reconstruct non-sparse raw FECG recordings. Experimental results show that the framework can reconstruct the raw recordings with high quality. Especially, the reconstruction does not destroy the interdependence relation among the multichannel recordings. This ensures that the independent component analysis decomposition of the reconstructed recordings has high fidelity. Furthermore, the framework allows the use of a sparse binary sensing matrix with much fewer nonzero entries to compress recordings. Particularly, each column of the matrix can contain only two nonzero entries. This shows the framework, compared to other algorithms such as current CS algorithms and wavelet algorithms, can greatly reduce code execution in CPU in the data compression stage. "
"We study the energy structure and the transfer of an extra electron or hole along periodic polymers made of $N$ monomers, with a repetition unit made of $P$ monomers, using a Tight-Binding wire model, where a site is a monomer (e.g., in DNA, a base pair), for $P$ even, and deal with two categories of such polymers: made of the same monomer (GC..., GGCC..., etc) and made of different monomers (GA..., GGAA..., etc). We calculate the HOMO and LUMO eigenspectra, density of states and HOMO-LUMO gap and find some limiting properties these categories possess, as $P$ increases. We further examine the properties of the mean over time probability to find the carrier at each monomer. We introduce the weighted mean frequency of each monomer and the total weighted mean frequency of the whole polymer, as a measure of the overall transfer frequency content. We study the pure mean transfer rates. These rates can be increased by many orders of magnitude with appropriate sequence choice. Generally, homopolymers display the most efficient charge transfer. Finally, we compare the pure mean transfer rates with experimental transfer rates obtained by time-resolved spectroscopy. "
"One major challenge for the legacy measurements at the LHC is that the likelihood function is not tractable when the collected data is high-dimensional and the detector response has to be modeled. We review how different analysis strategies solve this issue, including the traditional histogram approach used in most particle physics analyses, the Matrix Element Method, Optimal Observables, and modern techniques based on neural density estimation. We then discuss powerful new inference methods that use a combination of matrix element information and machine learning to accurately estimate the likelihood function. The MadMiner package automates all necessary data-processing steps. In first studies we find that these new techniques have the potential to substantially improve the sensitivity of the LHC legacy measurements. "
"In the presence of massive bosonic degrees of freedom, rotational superradiance can trigger an instability that spins down black holes. This leads to peculiar gravitational-wave signatures and distribution in the spin-mass plane, which in turn can impose stringent constraints on ultralight fields. Here, we demonstrate that there is an analogous spindown effect for conducting stars. We show that rotating stars amplify low frequency electromagnetic waves, and that this effect is largest when the time scale for conduction within the star is of the order of a light crossing time. This has interesting consequences for dark photons, as massive dark photons would cause stars to spin down due to superradiant instabilities. The time scale of the spindown depends on the mass of the dark photon, and on the rotation rate, compactness, and conductivity of the star. Existing measurements of the spindown rate of pulsars place direct constraints on models of dark sectors. Our analysis suggests that dark photons of mass $m_V \sim 10^{-12}$ eV are excluded by pulsar-timing observations. These constraints also exclude superradiant instabilities triggered by dark photons as an explanation for the spin limit of observed pulsars. "
"For any simple Lie algebra, a positive integer, and tuple of compatible weights, the conformal blocks bundle is a globally generated vector bundle on the moduli space of pointed rational curves. We classify all $S_n$-invariant vector bundles of conformal blocks for $\mathfrak{sl}_n$ which have rank one. We show that the cone generated by their base point free first Chern classes is polyhedral, generated by level one divisors. "
"Quantum carpets- in position and momentum space- woven by the self-interference of de Broglie wave of an atom or an electron, trapped in an infinitely deep potential well, are explained. The recurrence of self-similar structures in designs of these carpets mimics the phenomena of quantum revivals and fractional revivals. We identify fractional revivals of various order by means of these space-time and momentum-time interference patterns. "
"The vortex states in a thin mesoscopic disk are investigated within the phenomenological Ginzburg-Landau theory in the presence of a step-like external magnetic field with zero average which could model the field resulting from a ferromagnetic disk or a current carrying loop. The regions of existence of the multi-vortex state and the giant vortex state are found. We analyzed the phase transitions between them and found regions in which ring-shaped vortices contribute. Furthermore, we found a vortex state consisting of a central giant vortex surrounded by a collection of anti-vortices that are located in a ring around this giant vortex. "
In this paper we consider the geodesic X-ray transform with attenuation coefficient as a combination of smooth complex function and 1-form. We show that attenuated X-ray transform applied to the pair of tensors is injective modulo the natural obstruction.
"Nonconvex matrix recovery is known to contain no spurious local minima under a restricted isometry property (RIP) with a sufficiently small RIP constant $\delta$. If $\delta$ is too large, however, then counterexamples containing spurious local minima are known to exist. In this paper, we introduce a proof technique that is capable of establishing sharp thresholds on $\delta$ to guarantee the inexistence of spurious local minima. Using the technique, we prove that in the case of a rank-1 ground truth, an RIP constant of $\delta<1/2$ is both necessary and sufficient for exact recovery from any arbitrary initial point (such as a random point). We also prove a local recovery result: given an initial point $x_{0}$ satisfying $f(x_{0})\le(1-\delta)^{2}f(0)$, any descent algorithm that converges to second-order optimality guarantees exact recovery. "
"We present Spitzer imaging of the metal-deficient (Z ~30% Z_sun) Local Group dwarf galaxy NGC 6822. On spatial scales of ~130 pc, we study the nature of IR, H alpha, HI, and radio continuum emission. Nebular emission strength correlates with IR surface brightness; however, roughly half of the IR emission is associated with diffuse regions not luminous at H alpha (as found in previous studies). The global ratio of dust to HI gas in the ISM, while uncertain at the factor of ~2 level, is ~25 times lower than the global values derived for spiral galaxies using similar modeling techniques; localized ratios of dust to HI gas are about a factor of five higher than the global value in NGC 6822. There are strong variations (factors of ~10) in the relative ratios of H alpha and IR flux throughout the central disk; the low dust content of NGC 6822 is likely responsible for the different H alpha/IR ratios compared to those found in more metal-rich environments. The H alpha and IR emission is associated with high-column density (> ~1E21 cm^-2) neutral gas. Increases in IR surface brightness appear to be affected by both increased radiation field strength and increased local gas density. Individual regions and the galaxy as a whole fall within the observed scatter of recent high-resolution studies of the radio-far IR correlation in nearby spiral galaxies; this is likely the result of depleted radio and far-IR emission strengths in the ISM of this dwarf galaxy. "
"Adiabatic quantum computing is an analog quantum computing scheme with various applications in solving optimization problems. In the parity picture of quantum optimization, the problem is encoded in local fields that act on qubits which are connected via local 4-body terms. We present an implementation of a parity annealer with Transmon qubits with a specifically tailored Ising interaction from Josephson ring modulators. "
"It is demonstrated that in the (2+1)-dimensional topologically massive gauge theories an agreement of the Pauli-Villars regularization scheme with the other schemes can be achieved by employing pairs of auxiliary fermions with the opposite sign masses. This approach does not introduce additional violation of discrete (P and T) symmetries. Although it breaks the local gauge symmetry only in the regulator fields' sector, its trace disappears completely after removing the regularization as a result of superrenormalizability of the model. It is shown also that analogous extension of the Pauli-Villars regularization in the vector particle sector can be used to agree the arbitrary covariant gauge results with the Landau ones. The source of ambiguities in the covariant gauges is studied in detail. It is demonstrated that in gauges that are softer in the infrared region (e.g. Coulomb or axial) nonphysical ambiguities inherent to the covariant gauges do not arise. "
"A brief summary of results on Pb+Pb collisions from ALICE, ATLAS, and CMS is presented covering global event properties, anisotropic flow, jet quenching, and quarkonia. "
"We investigate the wave optics in the Schwarzschild spacetime. Applying the standard formalism of wave scattering problems, the Green function represented by the sum over the partial waves is evaluated using the Poisson sum formula. The effect of orbiting scattering due to the unstable circular orbit for null rays is taken into account as the contribution of the Regge poles of the scattering matrix and the asymptotic form of the scattering wave is obtained in the eikonal limit. Using this wave function, images of the black hole illuminated by a point source are reconstructed. We also discuss the wave effect in the frequency domain caused by the interference between the direct rays and the winding rays. "
"In this paper we discuss convergence properties and error estimates of rational Bernstein operators introduced by P. Pi\c{t}ul and P. Sablonni\`{e}re. It is shown that the rational Bernstein operators R_n converge to the identity operator if and only if \Delta_n, the maximal difference between two consecutive nodes of R_n, is converging to zero. Error estimates in terms of \Delta_n are provided. Moreover a Voronovskaja theorem is presented which is based on the explicit computation of higher order moments for the rational Bernstein operator. "
"We derive some new finite sums involving the sequence $s_{2}\left(n\right),$ the sum of digits of the expansion of $n$ in base $2.$ These functions allow us to generalize some classical results obtained by Allouche, Shallit and others. "
"There is now an increasing number of evidence supporting the idea that the cosmic Gamma-ray Bursts (GRBs) originate from the collapse of massive stars in distant star-forming galaxies. Because GRBs are likely detectable up to very high redshift, and because the gamma-rays are not attenuated by intervening columns of gas and dust, these phenomena thus offer a unique perspective to probe the star formation in the early Universe independently of the biases associated with dust extinction. We report on the R-K colors of the GRB host galaxies. We find that they are very blue sources, with colors comparable to those of the faint blue star-forming galaxies at high redshift. "
"Stochastic gene expression has been implicated in a variety of cellular processes, including cell differentiation and disease. In this issue of Cell, Weinberger et al. (2005) take an integrated computational-experimental approach to study the Tat transactivation feedback loop in HIV-1 and show that fluctuations in a key regulator, Tat, can result in a phenotypic bifurcation. This phenomenon is observed in an isogenic population where individual cells display two distinct expression states corresponding to latent and productive infection by HIV-1. These findings demonstrate the importance of stochastic gene expression in molecular ""decision-making."" "
"We calculate two-pion correlation functions at finite rapidities based on a hydrodynamical model which does not assume explicit boost invariance along the collision axis. Extracting the HBT radii through $\chi^2$ fits in both Cartesian and Yano-Koonin-Podgoretski\u{\i} parametrizations, we compare them with the experimental results obtained by the PHOBOS. Based on the results, we discuss longitudinal expansion dynamics. "
The turbulent transport of minority species/impurities is investigated in 2D drift-wave turbulence as well as in 3D toroidal drift-Alfven edge turbulence. The full effects of perpendicular and -- in 3D -- parallel advection are kept for the impurity species. Anomalous pinch effects are recovered and explained in terms of Turbulent EquiPartition (TEP)
"This work is devoted to Bloch oscillations (BO) of cold neutral atoms in optical lattices. After a general introduction to the phenomenon of BO and its realization in optical lattices, we study different extentions of this problem, which account for recent developments in this field. These are two-dimensional BO, decoherence of BO, and BO in correlated systems. Although these problems are discussed in relation to the system of cold atoms in optical lattices, many of the results are of general validity and can be well applied to other systems showing the phenomenon of BO. "
"Electron transfer processes at molecule-semiconductor interfaces involve a complex mixture of thermionic, tunneling and hopping events. Traditionally these processes have been modeled in a piece-meal fashion, relying on phenomenological treatments such as Simmons and Richardson equations that are not vetted in atomistic systems and do not flow seamlessly into each other. We present a unified modeling approach, based on the Non-equilibrium Greens function (NEGF) formalism that allows us to integrate diverse transport regimes and establish a comprehensive quantitative theory. By comparing our simulations with experiments on a metal-molecule-semiconductor junction (varying molecular lengths ~1-3nm), we identify the role of molecular monolayers in tuning the semiconductor band-bending, and thereby overall device conductivity. We find that the principal role of molecules is to act as a voltage divider, altering the Schottky barriers, thereby modulating current levels, voltage-asymmetries and crossover from Schottky to tunneling transport. While this provides an appealingly simple explanation for our observed experimental trends, the calculated shifts in crossover voltages are insufficient to explain the experiments quantitatively. Quantitative correspondence with experiments requires invocation of an additional voltage divider arising from molecular dipoles that further tunes semiconductor band-bending. The extracted dipole moments are rationalized using ab-initio calculations for each molecule, along-with a dilution of packing fraction for the shortest molecular lengths. The methodology described herein can be used to better understand and predict transport characteristics of such junctions. "
"We present a mapping of dynamical graphs and, in particular, the graphs used in the Quantum Graphity models for emergent geometry, into an Ising hamiltonian on the line graph of a complete graph with a fixed number of vertices. We use this method to study the properties of Quantum Graphity models at low temperature in the limit in which the valence coupling constant of the model is much greater than the coupling constants of the loop terms. Using mean field theory we find that an order parameter for the model is the average valence of the graph. We calculate the equilibrium distribution for the valence as an implicit function of the temperature. In the approximation in which the temperature is low, we find the first two Taylor coefficients of the valence in the temperature expansion. A discussion of the susceptibility function and a generalization of the model are given in the end. "
"A self-regulating magnetic flux pumping mechanism in tokamaks that maintains the core safety factor at $q\approx 1$, thus preventing sawteeth, is analyzed in nonlinear 3D magnetohydrodynamic simulations using the M3D-C$^1$ code. In these simulations, the most important mechanism responsible for the flux pumping is that a saturated $(m=1,n=1)$ quasi-interchange instability generates an effective negative loop voltage in the plasma center via a dynamo effect. It is shown that sawtoothing is prevented in the simulations if $\beta$ is sufficiently high to provide the necessary drive for the $(m=1,n=1)$ instability that generates the dynamo loop voltage. The necessary amount of dynamo loop voltage is determined by the tendency of the current density profile to centrally peak which, in our simulations, is controlled by the peakedness of the applied heat source profile. "
"In this note we give an example of affine quotient $G/H$ where $G$ is an affine algebraic group over an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0 and $H$ is a unipotent subgroup not contained in the unipotent radical of $G$. Some remarks about symmetric algebras of centralizers of nilpotent elements in simple Lie algebras, in particular cases, are added. "
"Dynamic heterogeneity is now recognised as a central aspect of structural relaxation in disordered materials with slow dynamics, and was the focus of intense research in the last decade. Here we describe how initial, indirect observations of dynamic heterogeneity have recently evolved into well-defined, quantitative, statistical characterisations, in particular through the use of high-order correlation and response functions. We highlight both recent progress and open questions about the characterisation of dynamic heterogeneity in glassy materials. We also discuss the limits of available tools and describe a few candidates for future research in order to gain deeper understanding of the origin and nature of glassiness in disordered systems. "
"We show that left-linear generalized semi-monadic TRSs effectively preserving recognizability of finite tree languages (are EPRF-TRSs). We show that reachability, joinability, and local confluence are decidable for EPRF-TRSs. "
"In a social learning setting, there is a set of actions, each of which has a fixed but unknown expected payoff. Agents arrive one by one, each chooses an action with the goal of maximizing the payoff. A disclosure policy coordinates the choices of the agents by sending messages about the history of past actions. These messages can alter agents' incentives towards ""exploration"", taking potentially sub-optimal actions for the sake of learning more about their rewards. The goal of the disclosure policy is to incentivize exploration so as to minimize the regret of the chosen action sequence. Prior work achieves much progress with disclosure policies that merely recommend an action to each user. However, all this work relies heavily on trust and rationality assumptions, standard in economic theory, yet quite problematic in the context of the motivating applications. In this paper, we design disclosure policies which incentivize good performance under more plausible behavioral assumptions. We would like to retain the trustworthiness of revealing the full history, while avoiding the herding behavior that it may induce. We focus on messages, called unbiased subhistories, consisting of the actions and rewards from a subsequence of past agents, where the subsequence is chosen ahead of time. We posit a flexible model of agent response, which we argue is plausible for our disclosure policies. Our main result is a disclosure policy using unbiased, transitive subhistories that obtains regret $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{\#rounds})$. We also exhibit simpler policies with higher, but still sublinear, regret. These policies can be interpreted as dividing a sublinear number of agents into constant-sized focus groups, whose histories are then fed to future agents. "
"We have performed magnetic measurements like temperature (T), cooling field (HFC) dependence of exchange bias (EB) and training effect to investigate the magnetic nature of the interface of the Fe/Ir20Mn80 systems. Thin film bilayer samples of different thicknesses of Ir20Mn80 have been prepared by dc magnetron sputtering at room temperature. The variation of exchange bias field (HEB) with the increase in thickness of Ir20Mn80 predicts the antiferromagnet (AFM) bulk spins contribution to EB. Exponential decay of HEB and coercive field (HC) with temperature reveals the presence of spin glass (SG) like interface. Also, the decrease of HEB with increasing HFC confirms the SG like frustration at the interface. Further, the fitting of training effect experimental data envisages the presence of frozen and rotatable spins at the magnetically frustrated interface of these EB systems. "
"Gaussian covariance graph models encode marginal independence among the components of a multivariate random vector by means of a graph $G$. These models are distinctly different from the traditional concentration graph models (often also referred to as Gaussian graphical models or covariance selection models) since the zeros in the parameter are now reflected in the covariance matrix $\Sigma$, as compared to the concentration matrix $\Omega =\Sigma^{-1}$. The parameter space of interest for covariance graph models is the cone $P_G$ of positive definite matrices with fixed zeros corresponding to the missing edges of $G$. As in Letac and Massam [Ann. Statist. 35 (2007) 1278--1323], we consider the case where $G$ is decomposable. In this paper, we construct on the cone $P_G$ a family of Wishart distributions which serve a similar purpose in the covariance graph setting as those constructed by Letac and Massam [Ann. Statist. 35 (2007) 1278--1323] and Dawid and Lauritzen [Ann. Statist. 21 (1993) 1272--1317] do in the concentration graph setting. We proceed to undertake a rigorous study of these ""covariance"" Wishart distributions and derive several deep and useful properties of this class. "
"In this paper, we study a geometric/topological measure of knots and links called the nullification number. The nullification of knots/links is believed to be biologically relevant. For example, in DNA topology, one can intuitively regard it as a way to measure how easily a knotted circular DNA can unknot itself through recombination of its DNA strands. It turns out that there are several different ways to define such a number. These definitions lead to nullification numbers that are related, but different. Our aim is to explore the mathematical properties of these nullification numbers. First, we give specific examples to show that the nullification numbers we defined are different. We provide detailed analysis of the nullification numbers for the well known 2-bridge knots and links. We also explore the relationships among the three nullification numbers, as well as their relationships with other knot invariants. Finally, we study a special class of links, namely those links whose general nullification number equals one. We show that such links exist in abundance. In fact, the number of such links with crossing number less than or equal to n grows exponentially with respect to n. "
"High quality single crystals of Cs$_2$Au$_2$X$_6$ (X=Br,I) were grown using a ternary self-flux method. Structural refinements based on single crystal X-ray diffraction measurements show that both materials have a distorted perovskite structure belonging to the I4/mmm space group with full site occupancy. Transport measurements reveal a large bandgap of 550 $\pm$ 100 meV for Cs$_2$Au$_2$I$_6$ and 520 $\pm$ 80 meV for Cs$_2$Au$_2$Br$_6$. Initial attempts at chemical substitution are described. "
A statistical mechanical framework to analyze linear vector channel models in digital wireless communication is proposed for a large system. The framework is a generalization of that proposed for code-division multiple-access systems in Europhys. Lett. 76 (2006) 1193 and enables the analysis of the system in which the elements of the channel transfer matrix are statistically correlated with each other. The significance of the proposed scheme is demonstrated by assessing the performance of an existing model of multi-input multi-output communication systems.
"In solid state conductors, linear response to a steady electric field is normally dominated by Bloch state occupation number changes that are correlated with group velocity and lead to a steady state current. However, for a number of important physical observables, the most important response even in conductors can be electric-field induced coherence between Bloch states in different bands, such as that responsible for screening in dielectrics. Examples include the anomalous and spin-Hall effects, spin torques, minimum conductivities and the chiral anomaly. In this paper we present a general quantum kinetic theory of linear response to an electric field which can be applied to solids with arbitrarily complicated band structures and includes the inter-band coherence response and the Bloch-state repopulation responses on an equal footing. We aim to enable extensive transport theory applications using computational packages based on maximally localized Wannier functions. The formalism is based on density-matrix equations of motion, on a Born approximation treatment of disorder, and on an expansion in scattering rate to leading non-trivial order. The quasiparticle bands are treated in a completely general manner that allows for arbitrary forms of the spin-orbit interaction and for the broken time reversal symmetry of magnetic conductors. We demonstrate that the inter-band response in conductors consists primarily of two terms: an intrinsic contribution due to the entire Fermi sea that captures the Berry curvature contribution to wave-packet dynamics, and an anomalous contribution caused by scattering that is sensitive to the presence of the Fermi surface. We solve for some electric-field response properties of simple model systems that are known to be dominated by interband coherence contributions and discuss an extensive list of complicated problems that cannot be solved analytically. "
"Many real world domains require the representation of a measure of uncertainty. The most common such representation is probability, and the combination of probability with logic programs has given rise to the field of Probabilistic Logic Programming (PLP), leading to languages such as the Independent Choice Logic, Logic Programs with Annotated Disjunctions (LPADs), Problog, PRISM and others. These languages share a similar distribution semantics, and methods have been devised to translate programs between these languages. The complexity of computing the probability of queries to these general PLP programs is very high due to the need to combine the probabilities of explanations that may not be exclusive. As one alternative, the PRISM system reduces the complexity of query answering by restricting the form of programs it can evaluate. As an entirely different alternative, Possibilistic Logic Programs adopt a simpler metric of uncertainty than probability. Each of these approaches -- general PLP, restricted PLP, and Possibilistic Logic Programming -- can be useful in different domains depending on the form of uncertainty to be represented, on the form of programs needed to model problems, and on the scale of the problems to be solved. In this paper, we show how the PITA system, which originally supported the general PLP language of LPADs, can also efficiently support restricted PLP and Possibilistic Logic Programs. PITA relies on tabling with answer subsumption and consists of a transformation along with an API for library functions that interface with answer subsumption. "
"A road map can be interpreted as a graph embedded in the plane, in which each vertex corresponds to a road junction and each edge to a particular road section. We consider the cartographic problem to place non-overlapping road labels along the edges so that as many road sections as possible are identified by their name, i.e., covered by a label. We show that this is NP-hard in general, but the problem can be solved in polynomial time if the road map is an embedded tree. "
"We performed various tests on a cosmological model in which the string gauge field, and its coupling to matter, is used to explain the rotation dynamics of stars in a galaxy. Observations used include perihelion precession and galaxy rotation curves. We solved precession motions for perturbations of 1) a Lorenz-like force and 2) a general power law central force. For the latter case, a simple rule judging pro/retrograde motions is derived. We attributed the precession of solar system planets to the force due to the string field and calculated the field strengths. We then fitted the resultant field strengths with a profile consisting one part generated by the Sun and another background due to other matter in the Milky Way. We used the Milky Way rotation curve to estimate the field strength and compared it with the one found by precession. The field strengths in another 22 galaxies are also analyzed. The strengths form a range that spans 2 orders of magnitude and contains the value found for the Milky Way. We also deduced from the model a relation between field strength, galaxy size and luminosity and verified it with data of the 22 galaxies. "
"A number of recent surveys for gravitational lenses have found examples of double Einstein rings. Here, we investigate analytically the occurrence of multiple Einstein rings. We prove, under very general assumptions, that at most one Einstein ring can arise from a mass distribution in a single plane lensing a single background source. Two or more Einstein rings can therefore only occur in multi-plane lensing. Surprisingly, we show that it is possible for a single source to produce more than one Einstein ring. If two point masses (or two isothermal spheres) in different planes are aligned with observer and source on the optical axis, we show that there are up to three Einstein rings. We also discuss the image morphologies for these two models if axisymmetry is broken, and give the first instances of magnification invariants in the case of two lens planes. "
"We prove that the bounded derived category of the surface S constructed by Barlow admits a length 11 exceptional sequence consisting of (explicit) line bundles. Moreover, we show that in a small neighbourhood of S in the moduli space of determinantal Barlow surfaces, the generic surface has a semiorthogonal decomposition of its derived category into a length 11 exceptional sequence of line bundles and a category with trivial Grothendieck group and Hochschild homology, called a phantom category. This is done using a deformation argument and the fact that the derived endomorphism algebra of the sequence is constant. Applying Kuznetsov's results on heights of exceptional sequences, we also show that the sequence on S itself is not full and its (left or right) orthogonal complement is also a phantom category. "
Let $S$ be a finite set of points in the plane and let $\mathcal{T}(S)$ be the set of intersection points between pairs of lines passing through any two points in $S$. We characterize all configurations of points $S$ such that iteration of the above operation produces a dense set. We also discuss partial results on the characterization of those finite point-sets with rational coordinates that generate all of $\mathbb Q^2$ through iteration of $\mathcal{T}$.
"Large and moderate deviation probabilities play an important role in many applied areas, such as insurance and risk analysis. This paper studies the exact moderate and large deviation asymptotics in non-logarithmic form for linear processes with independent innovations. The linear processes we analyze are general and therefore they include the long memory case. We give an asymptotic representation for probability of the tail of the normalized sums and specify the zones in which it can be approximated either by a standard normal distribution or by the marginal distribution of the innovation process. The results are then applied to regression estimates, moving averages, fractionally integrated processes, linear processes with regularly varying exponents and functions of linear processes. We also consider the computation of value at risk and expected shortfall, fundamental quantities in risk theory and finance. "
We describe the design of a Kalman filter that identifies suspension violin modes in an interferometric gravitational wave detectors data channel. We demonstrate the filter's effectiveness by applying it to data taken on the LIGO~40M prototype.
"The model I recently proposed for the structure of quasars (astro-ph/0008064) claims to unify all the emission, absorption and reflection phenomenology of quasars and AGN, and so is heavily overconstrained and readily tested. Here I concentrate on how the model has performed against tests since publication - with many of the tests being reported at this meeting. I then begin to explore how these and future tests can discriminate between this wind model and 3 well-defined alternatives. "
"Discrete time random walks on a finite set naturally translate via a one-to-one correspondence to discrete Laplace operators. Typically, Ollivier curvature has been investigated via random walks. We first extend the definition of Ollivier curvature to general weighted graphs and then give a strikingly simple representation of Ollivier curvature using the graph Laplacian. Using the Laplacian as a generator of a continuous time Markov chain, we connect Ollivier curvature with the heat equation which is strongly related to continuous time random walks. In particular, we prove that a lower bound on the Ollivier curvature is equivalent to a certain Lipschitz decay of solutions to the heat equation. This is a discrete analogue to a celebrated Ricci curvature lower bound characterization by Renesse and Sturm. Our representation of Ollivier curvature via the Laplacian allows us to deduce a Laplacian comparison principle by which we prove non-explosion and improved diameter bounds. "
"Some binary evolution scenarios to Type Ia supernovae include long-period binaries that evolve to symbiotic supersoft X-ray sources in their late stage of evolution. However, symbiotic stars with steady hydrogen burning on the white dwarf's (WD) surface are very rare, and the X-ray characteristics are not well known. SMC3 is one such rare example and a key object for understanding the evolution of symbiotic stars to Type Ia supernovae. SMC3 is an eclipsing symbiotic binary, consisting of a massive WD and red giant (RG), with an orbital period of 4.5 years in the Small Magellanic Cloud. The long-term V light curve variations are reproduced as orbital variations in the irradiated RG, whose atmosphere fills its Roche lobe, thus supporting the idea that the RG supplies matter to the WD at rates high enough to maintain steady hydrogen burning on the WD. We also present an eclipse model in which an X-ray emitting region around the WD is almost totally occulted by the RG swelling over the Roche lobe on the trailing side, although it is always partly obscured by a long spiral tail of neutral hydrogen surrounding the binary in the orbital plane. "
"We assume the latest experimental determination of the weak charge of atomic cesium and analyze its implications for possible new physics. We notice that the data would imply positive upper and lower bounds on the new physics contribution to the weak charge, $\delta_NQ_W$. The required new physics should be of a type not severely constrained by the high energy precision data. A simplest possibility would be new neutral vector bosons almost un-mixed to the $Z$ and with sizeable couplings to fermions. The lower positive bound would however forbid zero or negative $\delta_NQ_W$ and exclude not only the standard model but also models with sequential $Z^\prime$, in particular simple-minded towers of $Z$-like excitations from extra-dimensions. The bound would also imply an upper limit on the $Z^\prime$ mass within the models allowed. Conclusions are also derived for models of four-fermion contact interactions. "
"A probabilistic reconstruction using machine-learning of the decay kinematics of top-quark pairs produced in high-energy proton-proton collisions is presented. A deep neural network whose core consists of a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BLSTM) is trained to infer the four-momenta of the two top quarks produced in the hard scattering process. The MadGraph5+Pythia8 Monte Carlo event generator is used to create a sample of top-quark pairs decaying in the $\mu$+jets channel, whose final-state objects are used to create the input to the deep neural network. Distortions due to limited resolution of the experimental apparatus are simulated with the Delphes3 fast detector simulator. The level of agreement between the Monte Carlo predictions and the BLSTM for kinematic distributions at parton level is comparable to that obtained using a benchmark method that finds the jet permutation that minimizes an objective function. "
"A weak basis of a module is a generating set of the module minimal with respect to inclusion. A module is said to be regularly weakly based provided that each of its generating sets contain a weak basis. In the paper we study (1) rings over which all modules are regularly weakly based, refining results of Nashier and Nichols, (2) regularly weakly based modules over Dedekind domains. "
We investigate the physics potential of NuSOnG experiment to probe new physics contributions to Z-neutrino-neutrino couplings in muon-neutrino electron elastic and neutral-current deep-inelastic scattering processes. We employ an effective Lagrangian approach and do not a priori assume universality of the coupling of neutrinos to Z. We obtain 95% C.L. limits on possible universality violating couplings.
"We investigate the possibility to explain theoretically the observed deviations of S2 star orbit around the Galactic Centre using gravitational potentials derived from modified gravity models in absence of dark matter. To this aim, an analytic fourth-order theory of gravity, non-minimally coupled with a massive scalar field is considered. Specifically, the interaction term is given by analytic functions $f(R)$ and $f(R,\phi)$ where $R$ is the Ricci scalar and $\phi$ is a scalar field whose meaning can be related to further gravitational degrees of freedom. We simulate the orbit of S2 star around the Galactic Centre in $f(R)$ (Yukawa-like) and $f(R,\phi)$ (Sanders-like) gravity potentials and compare it with NTT/VLT observations. Our simulations result in strong constraints on the range of gravity interaction. In the case of analytic functions $f(R)$, we are not able to obtain reliable constraints on the derivative constants $f_1$ and $f_2$, because the current observations of S2 star indicated that they may be highly mutually correlated. In the case of analytic functions $f(R,\phi)$, we are able to obtain reliable constraints on the derivative constants $f_0$, $f_R$, $f_{RR}$, $f_{\phi}$, $f_{\phi\phi}$ and $f_{\phi R}$. The approach we are proposing seems to be sufficiently reliable to constrain the modified gravity models from stellar orbits around Galactic Centre. "
"We present an ansatz which makes the equations of motion more tractable for the simplest of Vasiliev's four-dimensional higher spin theories. The ansatz is similar to axial gauge in electromagnetism. We present a broad class of solutions in the gauge where the spatial connection vanishes, and we discuss the lift of one of these solutions to a full spacetime solution via a gauge transformation. "
"Given a connected open set $U\ne\emptyset$ in $ R^d$, $d\ge 2$, a relatively closed set $A$ in $U$ is called \emph{unavoidable in $U$}, if Brownian motion, starting in $x\in U\setminus A$ and killed when leaving $U$, hits $A$ almost surely or, equivalently, if the harmonic measure for $x$ with respect to $U\setminus A$ has mass $1$ on $A$. First a new criterion for unavoidable sets is proven which facilitates the construction of smaller and smaller unavoidable sets in $U$. Starting with an arbitrary champagne subdomain of $U$ (which is obtained omitting a locally finite union of pairwise disjoint closed balls $\overline B(z, r_z)$, $z\in Z$, satisfying $\sup_{z\in Z} r_z/\mbox{dist}(z,U^c)<1$), a combination of the criterion and the existence of small nonpolar compact sets of Cantor type yields a set $A$ on which harmonic measures for $U\setminus A$ are living and which has Hausdorff dimension $d-2$ and, if $d=2$, logarithmic Hausdorff dimension $1$. This can be done as well for Riesz potentials (isotropic $\alpha$-stable processes) on Euclidean space and for censored stable processes on $C^{1,1}$ open subsets. Finally, in the very general setting of a balayage space $(X,\mathcal W)$ on which the function $1$ is harmonic (which covers not only large classes of second order partial differential equations, but also non-local situations as, for example, given by Riesz potentials, isotropic unimodal L\'evy processes or censored stable processes) a construction of champagne subsets $X\setminus A$ of $X$ with small unavoidable sets $A$ is given which generalizes (and partially improves) recent constructions in the classical case. "
"The stimulate of this research seeks collaboration of firewalls which, could reach to the capability of distributed points of security policy; the front-end entity may much interact by the invaders so the separation between this entity and back-end entity to make the secure domain protection is necessary; collaborative security entity has the various task in the organization and there is a certain security policy to apply in; the entities like DPFF have to be protected from outsiders.

Let Hilb^p be the Hilbert scheme parametrizing the closed subschemes of P^n with Hilbert polynomial p \in Q[t] over a field K of characteristic zero. By bounding below the cohomological Hilbert functions of the points of Hilb^p we define locally closed subspaces of the Hilbert scheme. The aim of this thesis is to show that some of these subspaces are connected. For this we exploit the ideals constructed by D. Mall. It turns out that these ideals are sequentially Cohen-Macaulay and that their initial ideals and their generic initial ideals coincide for any admissible term order.
"An open question in the field of non-equilibrium statistical physics is whether there exists a unique way through which non-equilibrium systems equilibrate irrespective of how far they are away from equilibrium. To answer this question we have generated non-equilibrium states of various types of systems by molecular dynamics simulation technique. We have used a statistical method called system identification technique to understand the dynamical process of equilibration in reduced dimensional space. In this paper, we have tried to establish that the process of equilibration is unique. "
Let G be a Lie groupoid and L his Lie algebroid. We give a definition of the classical limit of a C^*-bundle and we use the tangent groupoid associated to G to show that the Poisson structure on L is the classical limit of a C^*-bundle.
"New moderate-resolution mid-infrared spectroscopy at 10 micron of 27 infrared galaxies is presented. The galaxies have been chosen from three 60 micron selected and one 12 micron selected complete flux-limited catalogs of galaxies; 17 of these sources have L_IR(8--1000 micron) >= 5 times 10^11 L_sun. A high-resolution spectrum of the source Arp 299B1 is also presented. Combining these new results with previously published results, a nearly complete 60 micron selected flux limited subsample, with L_IR(8--1000 micron) >= 1.6 times 10^11 L_sun of 25 galaxies is defined. Within this subsample, it is found that the dominant power source of infrared galaxies in the luminosity range 1.6 times 10^11 < L_IR(8--1000 micron) < 10^{12} L_sun is massive star formation based on the clear presence of the 11.3 micron aromatic hydrocarbon emission feature in the majority of the spectra. Three of the five ultraluminous infrared galaxies (L_IR(8--1000 micron) >= 10^12 L_sun) within this subsample show evidence that an active galactic nucleus provides an energetically important power source based on the detection of silicate absorption in their mid-infrared spectra. The physical basis of a possible anti-correlation between the 11.3 micron feature equivalent width and infrared light to molecular gas mass ratios is discussed. "
"The impurities of exchange couplings, external magnetic fields and Dzyaloshinskii--Moriya (DM) interaction considered as Gaussian distribution, the entanglement in one-dimensional random $XY$ spin systems is investigated by the method of solving the different spin-spin correlation functions and the average magnetization per spin. The entanglement dynamics at central locations of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic chains have been studied by varying the three impurities and the strength of DM interaction. (i) For ferromagnetic spin chain, the weak DM interaction can improve the amount of entanglement to a large value, and the impurities have the opposite effect on the entanglement below and above critical DM interaction. (ii) For antiferromagnetic spin chain, DM interaction can enhance the entanglement to a steady value. Our results imply that DM interaction strength, the impurity and exchange couplings (or magnetic field) play competing roles in enhancing quantum entanglement. "
"We present the first high signal-to-noise XMM-Newton observations of the broad-line radio galaxy 3C 411. After fitting various spectral models, an absorbed double power-law continuum and a blurred relativistic disk reflection model (kdblur) are found to be equally plausible descriptions of the data. While the softer power-law component ($\Gamma$=2.11) of the double power-law model is entirely consistent with that found in Seyfert galaxies (and hence likely originates from a disk corona), the additional power law component is very hard ($\Gamma$=1.05); amongst the AGN zoo, only flat-spectrum radio quasars have such hard spectra. Together with the very flat radio-spectrum displayed by this source, we suggest that it should instead be classified as a FSRQ. This leads to potential discrepancies regarding the jet inclination angle, with the radio morphology suggesting a large jet inclination but the FSRQ classification suggesting small inclinations. The kdblur model predicts an inner disk radius of at most 20 r$_g$ and relativistic reflection. "
"The effects of sampling rate and total measurement time have been determined for single-point measurements of step fluctuations within the context of first-passage properties. Time dependent STM has been used to evaluate step fluctuations on Ag(111) films grown on mica as a function of temperature (300-410 K), on screw dislocations on the facets of Pb crystallites at 320K, and on Al-terminated Si(111) over the temperature range 770K - 970K. Although the fundamental time constant for step fluctuations on Ag and Al/Si varies by orders of magnitude over the temperature ranges of measurement, no dependence of the persistence amplitude on temperature is observed. Instead, the persistence probability is found to scale directly with t/Dt where Dt is the time interval used for sampling. Survival probabilities show a more complex scaling dependence which includes both the sampling interval and the total measurement time tm. Scaling with t/Dt occurs only when Dt/tm is a constant. We show that this observation is equivalent to theoretical predictions that the survival probability will scale as Dt/L^z, where L is the effective length of a step. This implies that the survival probability for large systems, when measured with fixed values of tm or Dt should also show little or no temperature dependence. "
"We study the problem of a single impurity of mass $M$ immersed in a Fermi sea of particles of mass $m$. The impurity and the fermions interact through a s-wave narrow Feshbach resonance, so that the Feshbach length $R_*$ naturally appears in the system. We use simple variational ansatz, limited to at most one pair of particle-hole excitations of the Fermi sea and we determine for the polaronic and dimeronic branches the phase diagram between absolute ground state, local minimum, thermodynamically unstable regions (with negative effective mass), and regions of complex energies (with negative imaginary part). We also determine the closed channel population which is experimentally accessible. Finally we identify a non-trivial weakly attractive limit where analytical results can be obtained, in particular for the crossing point between the polaronic and dimeronic energy branches. "
"We study the Cuntz semigroup for non-simple $\text{C}^*$-algebras in this paper. In particular, we use the extended Elliott invariant to characterize the Cuntz comparison for $\text{C}^*$-algebras with the projection property which have only one ideal. "
"Very high intensities of galactic cosmic rays measured by Voyager 1 in the heliosheath appear to be incompatible with the presence of a modulation ""wall"" near the heliopause produced by a pile up of the heliospheric magnetic field. We propose that the modulation wall is a structure permeable to cosmic rays as a result of a sectored magnetic field topology compressed by plasma slowdown on approach to the heliopause and stretched to high latitudes by latitudinal flows in the heliosheath. The tightly folded warped current sheet permits efficient cosmic-ray transport in the radial direction via a drift-like mechanism. We show that when stochastic variations in the sector widths are taken into account, particle transport becomes predominantly diffusive both along and across the magnetic sectors. Using a test-particle model for cosmic rays in the heliosheath we investigate the dependence of the diffusion coefficients on the properties of the sector structure and on particle energy. "
"An exact analytical model of the process of collision and nonlinear interaction of gravitational and/or electromagnetic soliton wave and strong non-soliton electromagnetic traveling wave of arbitrary profile propagating in the expanding universe (the symmetric Kasner spacetime) is presented. In contrast to intuitive expectations that rather strong traveling waves can destroy the soliton, it occurs that the soliton survives during its interaction with electromagnetic wave of arbitrary amplitude and profile, but its parameters begin to evolve under the influence of this interaction. If a traveling electromagnetic wave possesses a finite duration, the soliton parameters after interaction take constant values again, but these values in general are different from those before the interaction. Based on exact solutions of Einstein - Maxwell equations, our model demonstrates a series of nonlinear phenomena, such as (a) creation of gravitational waves in the collision of two electromagnetic waves, (b) creation of electromagnetic soliton wave in the collision of gravitational soliton with traveling electromagnetic wave, (c) scattering of a part of soliton wave in the direction of propagation of traveling electromagnetic wave, (d) quasiperiodic oscillating character of fields in the wave interaction region and multiple mutual transformations of gravitational and electromagnetic waves in this region. The figures illustrate these features of nonlinear wave interactions in General Relativity. "
"We designed, fabricated, and characterized four arrays of horn--coupled, lumped element kinetic inductance detectors (LEKIDs), optimized to work in the spectral bands of the balloon-borne OLIMPO experiment. OLIMPO is a 2.6 m aperture telescope, aimed at spectroscopic measurements of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect. OLIMPO will also validate the LEKID technology in a representative space environment. The corrected focal plane is filled with diffraction limited horn-coupled KID arrays, with 19, 37, 23, 41 active pixels respectively at 150, 250, 350, and 460$\:$GHz. Here we report on the full electrical and optical characterization performed on these detector arrays before the flight. In a dark laboratory cryostat, we measured the resonator electrical parameters, such as the quality factors and the electrical responsivities, at a base temperature of 300$\:$mK. The measured average resonator $Q$s are 1.7$\times{10^4}$, 7.0$\times{10^4}$, 1.0$\times{10^4}$, and 1.0$\times{10^4}$ for the 150, 250, 350, and 460$\:$GHz arrays, respectively. The average electrical phase responsivities on resonance are 1.4$\:$rad/pW, 1.5$\:$rad/pW, 2.1$\:$rad/pW, and 2.1$\:$rad/pW; the electrical noise equivalent powers are 45$\:\rm{aW/\sqrt{Hz}}$, 160$\:\rm{aW/\sqrt{Hz}}$, 80$\:\rm{aW/\sqrt{Hz}}$, and 140$\:\rm{aW/\sqrt{Hz}}$, at 12 Hz. In the OLIMPO cryostat, we measured the optical properties, such as the noise equivalent temperatures (NET) and the spectral responses. The measured NET$_{\rm RJ}$s are $200\:\mu\rm{K\sqrt{s}}$, $240\:\mu\rm{K\sqrt{s}}$, $240\:\mu\rm{K\sqrt{s}}$, and $\:340\mu\rm{K\sqrt{s}}$, at 12 Hz; under 78, 88, 92, and 90 mK Rayleigh-Jeans blackbody load changes respectively for the 150, 250, 350, and 460 GHz arrays. The spectral responses were characterized with the OLIMPO differential Fourier transform spectrometer (DFTS) up to THz frequencies, with a resolution of 1.8 GHz. "
We prove the $L^2$ boundedness of the directional Hilbert transform in the plane relative to measurable vector fields which are constant on suitable Lipschitz curves.
"We use semiclassical propagation of singularities to give a general method for gluing together resolvent estimates. As an application we prove estimates for the analytic continuation of the resolvent of a Schr\""odinger operator for certain asymptotically hyperbolic manifolds in the presence of trapping which is sufficiently mild in one of several senses. As a corollary we obtain local exponential decay for the wave propagator and local smoothing for the Schr\""odinger propagator. "
"In this paper we study the Minimum Error Discrimination problem (MED) for ensembles of linearly independent (LI) states. We define a bijective map from the set of those ensembles to itself and we show that the Pretty Good Measurement (PGM) and the optimal measurement for the MED are related by the map. In particular, the fixed points of the map are those ensembles for which the PGM is the optimal measurement. Also, we simplify the optimality conditions for the measurement of an ensemble of LI states. "
"Efficient methods are proposed, for computing integrals appeaing in electronic structure calculations. The methods consist of two parts: the first part is to represent the integrals as contour integrals and the second one is to evaluate the contour integrals by the Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature. The efficiency of the proposed methods is demonstrated through numerical experiments. "
"Analytical pricing formulas and Greeks are obtained for European and American basket put options using Mellin transforms. We assume assets are driven by geometric Brownian motion which exhibit correlation and pay a continuous dividend rate. A novel approach to numerical Mellin inversion is achieved via the fast Fourier transform, enabling the computation of option values at equidistant log asset prices. Numerical accuracy is verified among existing methods for American call options. "
"We discuss the spectral analysis of quarkonium states in a hot medium of deconfined quarks and gluons, and we show that such an analysis provides a way to determine the thermal properties of the quark-gluon plasma. "
"In order to improve the data hiding in all types of multimedia data formats such as image and audio and to make hidden message imperceptible, a novel method for steganography is introduced in this paper. It is based on Least Significant Bit (LSB) manipulation and inclusion of redundant noise as secret key in the message. This method is applied to data hiding in images. For data hiding in audio, Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) both are used. All the results displayed prove to be time-efficient and effective. Also the algorithm is tested for various numbers of bits. For those values of bits, Mean Square Error (MSE) and Peak-Signal-to-Noise-Ratio (PSNR) are calculated and plotted. Experimental results show that the stego-image is visually indistinguishable from the original cover-image when n<=4, because of better PSNR which is achieved by this technique. The final results obtained after steganography process does not reveal presence of any hidden message, thus qualifying the criteria of imperceptible message. "
"We study production and equilibration of pions and muons in relativistic electron-positron-photon plasma at a temperature $T\ll m_\mu, m_\pi $. We argue that the observation of pions and muons can be a diagnostic tool in the study of the initial properties of such a plasma formed by means of strong laser fields. Conversely, properties of muons and pions in thermal environment become accessible to precise experimental study. "
"We study interacting features of $S_N$ Orbifold CFTs. Concentrating on characters (associated with $S_N$ Orbifold primaries) we first formulate a novel procedure for evaluating them through $GL(\infty)_+$ tracing. The result is a polynomial formula which we show gives results equivalent to those found by Bantay. From this we deduce a hierarchy of commuting Hamiltonians featuring locality in the induced space, and nonlinear string-type interactions. "
"Recent transient absorption experiments on CdS nanorods suggest that photoexcited holes rapidly trap to the surface of these particles and then undergo diffusion along the rod surface. In this paper, we present a semiperiodic DFT model for the CdS nanocrystal surface, analyze it, and comment on the nature of both the hole-trap states and the mechanism by which the holes diffuse. Hole states near the top of the valence band form an energetic near continuum with the bulk, and localize to the non-bonding sp$^3$ orbitals on surface sulfur atoms. After localization, the holes form nonadiabatic small polarons that move between the sulfur orbitals on the surface of the particle in a series of uncorrelated, incoherent, thermally-activated hops at room temperature. The surface-trapped holes are deeply in the weak-electronic coupling limit and, as a result, undergo slow diffusion. "
"For a simple digraph $G$, let $\beta(G)$ be the size of the smallest subset $X\subseteq E(G)$ such that $G-X$ has no directed cycles, and let $\gamma(G)$ be the number of unordered pairs of nonadjacent vertices in $G$. A digraph $G$ is called $m$-free if $G$ has no directed cycles of length at most $m$. This paper proves that $\beta(G)\leq \frac{1}{m-2}\gamma(G)$ for any $m$-free digraph $G$, which generalized some known results. "
"Description of the magnetic Bianchi VI$_0$ cosmologies of LeBlanc, Kerr, and Wainwright in the formalisms both of Belinskii, Khalatnikov, and Lifshitz, and of Misner allows qualitative understanding of the Mixmaster-like singularity in those models. "
"High-order harmonic generation (HHG) with relativistically strong laser pulses is considered employing electron ionization-recollisions from multiply charged ions in counterpropagating, linearly polarized attosecond pulse trains. The propagation of the harmonics through the medium and the scaling of HHG into the multi-kilo-electronvolt regime are investigated. We show that the phase mismatch caused by the free electron background can be compensated by an additional phase of the emitted harmonics specific to the considered setup which depends on the delay time between the pulse trains. This renders feasible the phase-matched emission of harmonics with photon energies of several tens of kilo-electronvolt from an underdense plasma. "
"We study theoretically a square lattice of the organometallic Kondo adsorbate iron(II) phtalocyanine (FePc) deposited on top of Au(111), motivated by recent scanning tunneling microscopy experiments. We describe the system by means of an effective Hubbard-Anderson model, where each molecule has degenerate effective $d-$orbitals with $xz$ and $yz$ symmetry, which we solve for arbitrary occupation and arbitrary on-site repulsion $U$. To that end, we introduce a generalized slave-boson mean-field approximation (SBMFA) which correctly describes both the non-interacting limit (NIL) $U=0$ and the strongly-interacting limit $U \rightarrow \infty$, where our formalism reproduces the correct value of the Kondo temperature for an isolated FePc molecule. Our results indicate that while the isolated molecule can be described by an SU(4) Anderson model in the Kondo regime, the case of the square lattice corresponds to the intermediate-valence regime, with a total occupation of nearly 1.65 holes in the FePc molecular orbitals. Our results have important implications for the physical interpretation of the experiment. "
"In this talk, I will illustrate how one can use the cosmic microwave background anisotropy measurements, in order to test theoretical models aiming at describing the early universe. "
"First principles electronic structure calculations based on density functional theory have been used to study the thermodynamic, structural and transport properties of solid solutions and liquid alloys of iron and oxygen at Earth's core conditions. Aims of the work are to determine the oxygen concentration needed to account for the inferred density in the outer core, to probe the stability of the liquid against phase separation, to interpret the bonding in the liquid, and to find out whether the viscosity differs significantly from that of pure liquid iron at the same conditions. It is shown that the required concentration of oxygen is in the region 25-30 mol percent, and evidence is presented for phase stability at these conditions. The Fe-O bonding is partly ionic, but with a strong covalent component. The viscosity is lower than that of pure liquid iron at Earth's core conditions. It is shown that earlier first-principles calculations indicating very large enthalpies of formation of solid solutions may need reinterpretation, since the assumed crystal structures are not the most stable at the oxygen concentration of interest. "
"Quantitative games, where quantitative objectives are defined on weighted game arenas, provide natural tools for designing faithful models of embedded controllers. Instances of these games that recently gained interest are the so called Energy Games. The fast-known algorithm solves Energy Games in O(EVW) where W is the maximum weight. Starting from a sequential baseline implementation, we investigate the use of massively data computation capabilities supported by modern Graphics Processing Units to solve the `initial credit problem' for Energy Games. We present four different parallel implementations on multi-core CPU and GPU systems. Our solution outperforms the baseline implementation by up to 36x speedup and obtains a faster convergence time on real-world graphs. "
"The two-proton correlation function at midrapidity from Pb+Pb central collisions at 158 AGeV has been measured by the NA49 experiment. The results are compared to model predictions from static thermal Gaussian proton source distributions and transport models RQMD and VENUS. An effective proton source size is determined by minimizing CHI-square/ndf between the correlation functions of the data and those calculated for the Gaussian sources, yielding 3.85 +-0.15(stat.) +0.60-0.25(syst.) fm. Both the RQMD and the VENUS model are consistent with the data within the error in the correlation peak region. "
"In the consistent histories formulation of quantum theory, the probabilistic predictions and retrodictions made from observed data depend on the choice of a consistent set. We show that this freedom allows the formalism to retrodict contrary propositions which correspond to orthogonal commuting projections and which each have probability one. We also show that the formalism makes contrary probability one predictions when applied to Gell-Mann and Hartle's generalised time-neutral quantum mechanics. "
"Steady flows that optimize heat transport are obtained for two-dimensional Rayleigh-B\'enard convection with no-slip horizontal walls for a variety of Prandtl numbers $Pr$ and Rayleigh number up to $Ra\sim 10^9$. Power law scalings of $Nu\sim Ra^{\gamma}$ are observed with $\gamma\approx 0.31$, where the Nusselt number $Nu$ is a non-dimensional measure of the vertical heat transport. Any dependence of the scaling exponent on $Pr$ is found to be extremely weak. On the other hand, the presence of two local maxima of $Nu$ with different horizontal wavenumbers at the same $Ra$ leads to the emergence of two different flow structures as candidates for optimizing the heat transport. For $Pr \lesssim 7$, optimal transport is achieved at the smaller maximal wavenumber. In these fluids, the optimal structure is a plume of warm rising fluid which spawns left/right horizontal arms near the top of the channel, leading to downdrafts adjacent to the central updraft. For $Pr > 7$ at high-enough Ra, the optimal structure is a single updraft absent significant horizontal structure, and characterized by the larger maximal wavenumber. "
"Accreting pulsars power relativistic jets, and display a complex spin phenomenology. These behaviours may be closely related to the large-scale configuration of the star's magnetic field, shaped by its interaction with the surrounding accretion disc. Here we present the first relativistic simulations of the interaction of a pulsar magnetosphere with an accretion flow. Our axisymmetric simulations treat the magnetospheric, or coronal, regions using a resistive extension of force-free electrodynamics. The magnetic field is also evolved inside the disc, which is a defined volume with a specified velocity field and conductivity profile, found using an alpha-disc model. We study a range of disc alpha-parameters, thicknesses, magnetic Prandtl numbers, and inner truncation radii. We find that a large fraction of the magnetic flux in the pulsar's closed zone is opened by the intrusion of the disc, leading to an enhancement of the power extracted by the pulsar wind and the spin-down torque applied to the pulsar. In our simulations, most of the spin-down contribution to the stellar torque acts on open field lines. The efficiency of field-line opening is high in the simulations' long-term quasi-steady states, which implies that a millisecond pulsar's electromagnetic wind could be strong enough to power the observed neutron-star radio jets, and may significantly affect the pulsar's spin evolution. "
"We consider a cellular network where mobile transceiver devices that are owned by self-interested users are incentivized to cooperate with each other using tokens, which they exchange electronically to ""buy"" and ""sell"" downlink relay services, thereby increasing the network's capacity compared to a network that only supports base station-to-device (B2D) communications. We investigate how an individual device in the network can learn its optimal cooperation policy online, which it uses to decide whether or not to provide downlink relay services for other devices in exchange for tokens. We propose a supervised learning algorithm that devices can deploy to learn their optimal cooperation strategies online given their experienced network environment. We then systematically evaluate the learning algorithm in various deployment scenarios. Our simulation results suggest that devices have the greatest incentive to cooperate when the network contains (i) many devices with high energy budgets for relaying, (ii) many highly mobile users (e.g., users in motor vehicles), and (iii) neither too few nor too many tokens. Additionally, within the token system, self-interested devices can effectively learn to cooperate online, and achieve over 20% higher throughput on average than with B2D communications alone, all while selfishly maximizing their own utilities.

"Since low-mass stars have low luminosities, orbits at which liquid water can exist on Earth-sized planets are relatively close-in, which produces Doppler signals that are detectable using state-of-the-art Doppler spectroscopy. GJ 667C is already known to be orbited by two super-Earth candidates. We investigate whether the data supports the presence of additional companions. We obtain new Doppler measurements from HARPS extracted spectra and combined them with those obtained from the PFS and HIRES spectrographs. We used Bayesian and periodogram-based methods to re-assess the number of candidates and evaluated the confidence of each detection. Among other tests, we validated the planet candidates by analyzing correlations of each Doppler signal activity indices and investigate quasi-periodicity. Doppler measurements of GJ 667C are described better by six Keplerian-like signals: the two known candidates (b and c); three additional few-Earth mass candidates with periods of 92, 62 and 39 days (d, e and f); a cold super-Earth in a 260-day orbit (g) and tantalizing evidence of a $\sim$ 1 M$_\oplus$ object in a close-in orbit of 17 days (h). We explore whether long-term stable orbits are compatible with the data by integrating 8$\times 10^4$ solutions derived from the Bayesian samplings. The system consisting of six planets is compatible with dynamically stable configurations. As for the solar system, the most stable solutions do not contain mean-motion resonances and are described well by analytic Laplace-Lagrange solutions. The presence of a seventh planet (h) is supported by the fact that it appears squarely centered on the only island of stability left in the six-planet solution. Habitability assessments accounting for the stellar flux, as well as tidal dissipation effects, indicate that three (maybe four) planets are potentially habitable... "
"Very recently (by which we mean two days ago), Y. Sekiwa submitted a paper [arXiv:0802.3266] that dismisses some previous calculations of the de Sitter radiative temperature. Significantly, these calculations employed the (so-called) tunneling methodology, which the stated author then goes on to correspondingly revise. After briefly commenting on what the tunneling framework can be claimed to say and what it cannot, we respond to the author's criticisms and proposed revision. "
"The properties of water can have a strong dependence on the confinement. Here, we consider a water monolayer nanoconfined between hydrophobic parallel walls under conditions that prevent its crystallization. We investigate, by simulations of a many-body coarse-grained water model, how the properties of the liquid are affected by the confinement. We show, by studying the response functions and the correlation length and by performing finite-size scaling of the appropriate order parameter, that at low temperature the monolayer undergoes a liquid-liquid phase transition ending in a critical point in the universality class of the two-dimensional (2D) Ising model. Surprisingly, by reducing the linear size L of the walls, keeping the walls separation h constant, we find a 2D-3D crossover for the universality class of the liquid-liquid critical point for L/h~50, i.e. for a monolayer thickness that is small compared to its extension. This result is drastically different from what is reported for simple liquids, where the crossover occurs for L/h ~ 5, and is consistent with experimental results and atomistic simulations. We shed light on these findings showing that they are a consequence of the strong cooperativity and the low coordination number of the hydrogen bond network that characterizes water. "
"We imaged two starless molecular cloud cores, TUKH083 and TUKH122, in the Orion A giant molecular cloud in the CCS and ammonia (NH$_3$) emission with the Very Large Array. TUKH122 contains one NH$_3$ core ""TUKH122-n,"" which is elongated and has a smooth oval boundary. Where observed, the CCS emission surrounds the NH$_3$ core. This configuration resembles that of the N$_2$H$^+$ and CCS distribution in the Taurus starless core L1544, a well-studied example of a dense prestellar core exhibiting infall motions. The linewidth of TUKH122-n is narrow (0.20 km s$^{-1}$) in the NH$_3$ emission line and therefore dominated by thermal motions. The smooth oval shape of the core boundary and narrow linewidth in NH$_3$ seem to imply that TUKH122-n is dynamically relaxed and quiescent. TUKH122-n is similar to L1544 in the kinetic temperature (10 K), linear size (0.03 pc), and virial mass ($\sim$ 2 $M_{\odot}$). Our results strongly suggest that TUKH122-n is on the verge of star formation. TUKH122-n is embedded in the 0.2 pc massive (virial mass $\sim$ 30 $M_{\odot}$) turbulent parent core, while the L1544 NH$_3$ core is embedded in the 0.2 pc less-massive (virial mass $\sim$ 10 $M_{\odot}$) thermal parent core. TUKH083 shows complicated distribution in NH$_3$, but was not detected in CCS. The CCS emission toward TUKH083 appears to be extended, and is resolved out in our interferometric observations. "
"The ninth part of the OGLE-III Catalog of Variable Stars (OIII-CVS) comprises RR Lyr stars in the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC). Our sample consists of 2475 variable stars, of which 1933 pulsate in the fundamental mode (RRab), 175 are the first overtone pulsators (RRc), 258 oscillate simultaneously in both modes (RRd) and 109 stars are suspected second-overtone pulsators (RRe). 30 objects are Galactic RR Lyr stars seen in the foreground of the SMC. We discuss some statistical features of the sample. Period distributions show distinct differences between SMC and LMC populations of RR Lyr variable stars, with the SMC stars having on average longer periods. The mean periods for RRab, RRc and RRe stars are 0.596, 0.366 and 0.293 days, respectively. The mean apparent magnitudes of RRab stars are equal to 19.70 mag in the V-band and 19.12 mag in the I-band. Spatial distribution of RR Lyr stars shows that the halo of the SMC is roughly round in the sky, however the density map reveals two maxima near the center of the SMC. For each object the multi-epoch V- and I-band photometry collected over 8 or 13 years of observations and finding charts are available to the astronomical community from the OGLE Internet archive. "
"We discuss renormalization in a toy model with one fermion field and one real scalar field phi, featuring a spontaneously broken discrete symmetry which forbids a fermion mass term and a phi^3 term in the Lagrangian. We employ a renormalization scheme which uses the MSbar scheme for the Yukawa and quartic scalar couplings and renormalizes the vacuum expectation value of phi by requiring that the one-point function of the shifted field is zero. In this scheme, the tadpole contributions to the fermion and scalar selfenergies are canceled by choice of the renormalization parameter delta_v of the vacuum expectation value. However, delta_v and, therefore, the tadpole contributions reenter the scheme via the mass renormalization of the scalar, in which place they are indispensable for obtaining finiteness. We emphasize that the above renormalization scheme provides a clear formulation of the hierarchy problem and allows a straightforward generalization to an arbitrary number of fermion and scalar fields. "
"Today's multiagent systems have grown too complex to rely on centralized controllers, prompting increasing interest in the design of distributed algorithms. In this respect, game theory has emerged as a valuable tool to complement more traditional techniques. The fundamental idea behind this approach is the assignment of agents' local cost functions, such that their selfish minimization attains, or is provably close to, the global objective. Any algorithm capable of computing an equilibrium of the corresponding game will inherit an approximation ratio that is, in the worst case, equal to the price-of-anarchy of the considered class of equilibria. Therefore, a successful application of the game design approach hinges on the possibility to quantify and optimize the equilibrium performance. Toward this end, we introduce the notion of generalized smoothness, and show that the resulting efficiency bounds are significantly tighter compared to those obtained using the traditional smoothness approach. Leveraging this newly-introduced notion, we quantify the equilibrium performance for the class of local resource allocation games. Finally, we show how the agents' local decision rules can be designed in order to optimize the efficiency of the corresponding equilibria, by means of a tractable linear program. "
"We consider the G\""odel bi-modal logic determined by fuzzy Kripke models where both the propositions and the accessibility relation are infinitely valued over the standard G\""odel algebra [0,1] and prove strong completeness of Fischer Servi intuitionistic modal logic IK plus the prelinearity axiom with respect to this semantics. We axiomatize also the bi-modal analogues of $T,$ $S4,$ and $S5$ obtained by restricting to models over frames satisfying the [0,1]-valued versions of the structural properties which characterize these logics. As application of the completeness theorems we obtain a representation theorem for bi-modal G\""odel algebras. "
"Time series classification (TSC) is the area of machine learning interested in learning how to assign labels to time series. The last few decades of work in this area have led to significant progress in the accuracy of classifiers, with the state of the art now represented by the HIVE-COTE algorithm. While extremely accurate, HIVE-COTE is infeasible to use in many applications because of its very high training time complexity in O(N^2*T^4) for a dataset with N time series of length T. For example, it takes HIVE-COTE more than 72,000s to learn from a small dataset with N=700 time series of short length T=46. Deep learning, on the other hand, has now received enormous attention because of its high scalability and state-of-the-art accuracy in computer vision and natural language processing tasks. Deep learning for TSC has only very recently started to be explored, with the first few architectures developed over the last 3 years only. The accuracy of deep learning for TSC has been raised to a competitive level, but has not quite reached the level of HIVE-COTE. This is what this paper achieves: outperforming HIVE-COTE's accuracy together with scalability. We take an important step towards finding the AlexNet network for TSC by presenting InceptionTime---an ensemble of deep Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) models, inspired by the Inception-v4 architecture. Our experiments show that InceptionTime slightly outperforms HIVE-COTE with a win/draw/loss on the UCR archive of 40/6/39. Not only is InceptionTime more accurate, but it is much faster: InceptionTime learns from that same dataset with 700 time series in 2,300s but can also learn from a dataset with 8M time series in 13 hours, a quantity of data that is fully out of reach of HIVE-COTE.

"Probabilistic conceptual network is a knowledge representation scheme designed for reasoning about concepts and categorical abstractions in utility-based categorization. The scheme combines the formalisms of abstraction and inheritance hierarchies from artificial intelligence, and probabilistic networks from decision analysis. It provides a common framework for representing conceptual knowledge, hierarchical knowledge, and uncertainty. It facilitates dynamic construction of categorization decision models at varying levels of abstraction. The scheme is applied to an automated machining problem for reasoning about the state of the machine at varying levels of abstraction in support of actions for maintaining competitiveness of the plant.

"We aim at an augmentation of communication abilities of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients by creating a brain-computer interface (BCI) which can control a computer or other device by using only brain activity. As a method, we use a stimulus-driven BCI based on vibration stimuli delivered via a gaming pad to the user's back. We identify P300 responses from brain activity data in response to the vibration stimuli. The user's intentions are classified according to the P300 responses recorded in the EEG. From the results of the psychophysical and online BCI experiments, we are able to classify the P300 responses very accurately, which proves the effectiveness of the proposed method. "
"We construct the first and second Chern-Ricci functions on negatively curved minimal surfaces in ${\mathbb{R}}^{3}$ using Gauss curvature and angle functions, and establish that they become harmonic functions on the minimal surfaces. We prove that a minimal surface has constant first Chern-Ricci function if and only if it is Enneper's surface. We explicitly determine the moduli space of minimal surfaces having constant second Chern-Ricci function, which contains catenoids, helicoids, and their associate families. "
"High-resolution X-ray observations have revealed cavities and `cold fronts' with sharp edges in temperature, density, and metallicity within galaxy clusters. Their presence poses a puzzle since these features are not expected to be hydrodynamically stable, or to remain sharp in the presence of diffusion. However, a moving core or bubble in even a very weakly magnetized plasma necessarily sweeps up enough magnetic field to build up a dynamically important sheath around the object; the layer's strength is set by a competition between `plowing up' of field and field lines slipping around the core. We show that a two-dimensional approach to the problem is quite generally not possible. In three dimensions, we show with analytic arguments and in numerical experiments, that this magnetic layer modifies the dynamics of a plunging core, greatly modifies the effects of hydrodynamic instabilities on the core, modifies the geometry of stripped material, and even slows the fall of the core through magnetic tension. We derive an expression for the maximum magnetic field strength, the thickness of the layer, and the opening angle of the magnetic wake. The morphology of the magnetic draping layer implies the suppression of thermal conduction across the layer, thus conserving strong temperature gradients over the contact surface. The intermittent amplification of the magnetic field as well as the injection of MHD turbulence in the wake of the core is identified to be due to vorticity generation within the magnetic draping layer. These results have important consequences for understanding the physical properties and the complex gasdynamical processes of the intra-cluster medium, and apply quite generally to motions through other magnetized environments, e.g., the ISM. "
"Isolated horizons are a quasi-local framework, developed over the last 15 years by many authors, for modeling black holes `in equilibrium' that involves assumptions only about geometric structures intrinsic to the horizon. We review the motivations for the framework, and the derivation of the key results, both classical and quantum. "
"The 'boxicity' ('cubicity') of a graph G is the minimum natural number k such that G can be represented as an intersection graph of axis-parallel rectangular boxes (axis-parallel unit cubes) in $R^k$. In this article, we give estimates on the boxicity and the cubicity of Cartesian, strong and direct products of graphs in terms of invariants of the component graphs. In particular, we study the growth, as a function of $d$, of the boxicity and the cubicity of the $d$-th power of a graph with respect to the three products. Among others, we show a surprising result that the boxicity and the cubicity of the $d$-th Cartesian power of any given finite graph is in $O(\log d / \log\log d)$ and $\theta(d / \log d)$, respectively. On the other hand, we show that there cannot exist any sublinear bound on the growth of the boxicity of powers of a general graph with respect to strong and direct products. "
"Most quantum states have wavefunctions that are widely spread over the accessible Hilbert space and hence do not have a good description in terms of a single classical geometry. In order to understand when geometric descriptions are possible, we exploit the AdS/CFT correspondence in the half-BPS sector of asymptotically AdS_5 x S^5 universes. In this sector we devise a ""coarse-grained metric operator"" whose eigenstates are well described by a single spacetime topology and geometry. We show that such half-BPS universes have a non-vanishing entropy if and only if the metric is singular, and that the entropy arises from coarse-graining the geometry. Finally, we use our entropy formula to find the most entropic spacetimes with fixed asymptotic moments beyond the global charges. "
"In this article we review some recent developments in heterotic compactifications. In particular we review an ``inherently toric'' description of certain sheaves, called equivariant sheaves, that has recently been discussed in the physics literature. We outline calculations that can be performed with these objects, and also outline more general phenomena in moduli spaces of sheaves. "
"The Regge limit in perturbative QCD for processes as DIS (low x) and photon or onia-particles scattering is considered. In the first part a phenomenological approach for the inclusion of the running coupling, preserving the gluon reggeization property, is analyzed. In particular the spectrum of the hard pomeron equation and the asymptotic form of the solution are used to study scattering processes with also inclusive jet production. The singlet part of the proton structure function is evolved towards the low x region according to the full equation. In the second part the problem of unitarity in the QCD is considered. Following the general Bartels approach the four reggeized gluon system is studied in the large number of colours limit. The interplay between double pomeron exchange and triple pomeron vertex contributions is studied. The conformal invariance of the three pomeron vertex is shown in terms of a building block function, and the coupling to pomerons has been considered to make contact with the colour dipole picture which presents a similar triple pomeron interaction. It is also shown that in the A.H. Mueller approach his equation for higher order colour dipole densities leads to solutions which can be represented as fan diagrams with only triple pomeron vertices. Finally we draw some conclusion and open problems. "
"Here, we present our modelling (Ryde & Eriksson, 2002 A&A 386, 874) of the 2.6-3.7 micron spectrum of the red semiregular variable R Doradus observed with the Short-Wavelength Spectrometer on board the Infrared Space Observatory. We will also present the entire spectrum of R Dor up to 5 microns based on our model photosphere in order to show which molecules are important for the emergent spectrum. "
"We show that the magneto-electric coupling in 3D (strong) topological insulators is related to a second derivative of the bulk magnetization. The formula we derive is the non-linear response analog of the Streda formula for Hall conductivity (P. Streda, J. Phys. C: Solid State Physics, 15, 22 (1982)), which relates the Hall conductivity to the derivative of the magnetization with respect to chemical potential. Our finding allows one to extract the magneto-electric coefficient by measuring the magnetization, while varying the chemical potential and one more perturbing field. Such an experimental setup could circumvent many of the current difficulties with measuring the magneto-electric response in 3D topological insulators. The relation we find also makes transparent the effect of disorder on the magneto-electric response, which occurs only through the density of states, and has no effect when the system is gapped. "
"Observations of density profiles of galaxies and clusters constrain the properties of dark matter. Formation of stable halos by collisional fluids with very low mass particles appears as the most probable interpretation, while halos formed by high mass particles, left over from a hot big bang, can scarcely explain the observed density distributions. Detection methods of dark matter are discussed. "
In this article it is proved the equality of condenser capacity and modulus of family of curves joining the plates of condenser in Sub-Finsler spaces
"Recently, Magnetic Resonance Fingerprinting (MRF) was proposed as a quantitative imaging technique for the simultaneous acquisition of tissue parameters such as relaxation times $T_1$ and $T_2$. Although the acquisition is highly accelerated, the state-of-the-art reconstruction suffers from long computation times: Template matching methods are used to find the most similar signal to the measured one by comparing it to pre-simulated signals of possible parameter combinations in a discretized dictionary. Deep learning approaches can overcome this limitation, by providing the direct mapping from the measured signal to the underlying parameters by one forward pass through a network. In this work, we propose a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) architecture in combination with a novel quantile layer. RNNs are well suited for the processing of time-dependent signals and the quantile layer helps to overcome the noisy outliers by considering the spatial neighbors of the signal. We evaluate our approach using in-vivo data from multiple brain slices and several volunteers, running various experiments. We show that the RNN approach with small patches of complex-valued input signals in combination with a quantile layer outperforms other architectures, e.g. previously proposed CNNs for the MRF reconstruction reducing the error in $T_1$ and $T_2$ by more than 80%. "
"Gamma ray bursts (GRBs) have recently attracted much attention as a possible way to extend the Hubble diagram to very high redshift. To this aim, the luminosity (or isotropic emitted energy) of a GRB at redshift z must be evaluated from a correlation with a distance independent quantity so that one can then solve for the luminosity distance D_L(z) and hence the distance modulus mu(z). Averaging over five different two parameters correlations and using a fiducial cosmological model to calibrate them, Schaefer (2007) has compiled a sample of 69 GRBs with measured mu(z) which has since then been widely used to constrain cosmological parameters. We update here that sample by many aspects. First, we add a recently found correlation for the X - ray afterglow and use a Bayesian inspired fitting method to calibrate the different GRBs correlations known insofar assuming a fiducial LCDM model in agreement with the recent WMAP5 data. Averaging over six correlations, we end with a new GRBs Hubble diagram comprising 83 objects. We also extensively explore the impact of varying the fiducial cosmological model considering how the estimated mu(z) change as a function of the $(\Omega_M, w_0, w_a)$ parameters of the Chevallier - Polarski - Linder phenomenological dark energy equation of state. In order to avoid the need of assuming an {\it a priori} cosmological model, we present a new calibration procedure based on a model independent local regression estimate of mu(z) using the Union SNeIa sample to calibrate the GRBs correlations. This finally gives us a GRBs Hubble diagram made out of 69 GRBs whose estimated distance modulus mu(z) is almost independent on the underlying cosmological model. "
"Heavy--light QCD currents are matched with HQET currents at two loops and leading order in $1/m$. A single formula applies to all current matchings. As a by--product, a master formula for the two--loop anomalous dimension of the QCD current $\bar{q}\gamma^{[\mu_1}\ldots\gamma^{\mu_n]}q$ is obtained, yielding a new result for the tensor current. The dependence of matching coefficients on $\gamma_5$ prescriptions is elucidated. Ratios of QCD matrix elements are obtained, independently of the three--loop anomalous dimension of HQET currents. The two--loop coefficient in $f_{{\rm B}^*}/f_{\rm B} =1-2\alpha_{\rm s}(m_b)/3\pi-K_b\alpha_{\rm s}^2/\pi^2 +{\rm O}(\alpha_{\rm s}^3,1/m_b)$ is \[K_b=\frac{83}{12}+\frac{4}{81}\pi^2+\frac{2}{27}\pi^2\log2-\frac19\zeta(3) -\frac{19}{54}N_l+\Delta_c=6.37+\Delta_c\] with $N_l=4$ light flavours, and a correction, $\Delta_c=0.18\pm0.01$, that takes account of the non--zero ratio $m_c/m_b=0.28\pm0.03$. Fastest apparent convergence would entail $\alpha_{\rm s}(\mu)$ at $\mu=370$~MeV. ``Naive non--abelianization'' of large--$N_l$ results, via $N_l\to N_l-\frac{33}{2}$, gives reasonable approximations to exact two--loop results. All--order results for anomalous dimensions and matching coefficients are obtained at large $\beta_0=11-\frac23N_l$. Consistent cancellation between infrared-- and ultraviolet--renormalon ambiguities is demonstrated. "
"We discuss the effect of electron-electron interactions on the static polarization properties of graphene beyond RPA. Divergent self-energy corrections are naturally absorbed into the renormalized coupling constant $\alpha$. We find that the lowest order vertex correction, which is the first non-trivial correlation contribution, is finite, and about 30% of the RPA result at strong coupling $\alpha \sim 1$. The vertex correction leads to further reduction of the effective charge. Finite contributions to dielectric screening are expected in all orders of perturbation theory. "
"The back-propagation algorithm is the cornerstone of deep learning. Despite its importance, few variations of the algorithm have been attempted. This work presents an approach to discover new variations of the back-propagation equation. We use a domain specific lan- guage to describe update equations as a list of primitive functions. An evolution-based method is used to discover new propagation rules that maximize the generalization per- formance after a few epochs of training. We find several update equations that can train faster with short training times than standard back-propagation, and perform similar as standard back-propagation at convergence. "
"We present a timing solution for the 598.89 Hz accreting millisecond pulsar, IGR J00291+5934, using Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer data taken during the two outbursts exhibited by the source on 2008 August and September. We estimate the neutron star spin frequency and we refine the system orbital solution. To achieve the highest possible accuracy in the measurement of the spin frequency variation experienced by the source in-between the 2008 August outburst and the last outburst exhibited in 2004, we re-analysed the latter considering the whole data set available. We find that the source spins down during quiescence at an average rate of {\nu}dot_{sd}=(-4.1 +/- 1.2)E-15 Hz/s. We discuss possible scenarios that can account for the long-term neutron star spin-down in terms of either magneto-dipole emission, emission of gravitational waves, and a propeller effect. If interpreted in terms of magneto-dipole emission, the measured spin down translates into an upper limit to the neutron star magnetic field, B<=3E+08 G, while an upper limit to the average neutron star mass quadrupole moment of Q<=2E+36 g cm^2 is set if the spin down is interpreted in terms of the emission of gravitational waves.

Quicksort on the fly returns the input of $n$ reals in increasing natural order during the sorting process. Correctly normalized the running time up to returning the l-th smallest out of n seen as a process in l converges weakly to a limiting process with path in the space of cadlag functions.
"We compare tunneling density of states (TDOS) into two ultrathin Ag films, one uniform and one granular, for different degrees of disorder. The uniform film shows a crossover from Altshuler-Aronov (AA) zero bias anomaly to Efros Shklovskii (ES) like Coulomb gap as the disorder is increased. The granular film, on the other hand, exhibits AA behavior even deeply in the insulating regime. We analyze the data and find that granularity introduces a new regime for the TDOS. While the conductivity is dominated by hopping between clusters of grains and is thus insulating, the TDOS probes the properties of an individual cluster which is ""metallic"". "
"Fractional Josephson vortices carry a magnetic flux Phi, which is a fraction of the magnetic flux quantum Phi_0 ~ 2.07x10^{-15} Wb. Their properties are very different from the properties of the usual integer fluxons. In particular, fractional vortices are pinned and have an oscillation eigenfrequency which is expected to be within the Josephson plasma gap. Using microwave spectroscopy, we investigate the dependence of the eigenfrequency of a fractional Josephson vortex on its magnetic flux $\Phi$ and on the bias current. The experimental results are in good agreement with the theoretical predictions. "
"We have obtained precision astrometry of the planet hosting M dwarf GJ 317 in the framework of the Carnegie Astrometric Planet Search project. The new astrometric measurements give a distance determination of 15.3 pc, 65% further than previous estimates. The resulting absolute magnitudes suggest it is metal rich and more massive than previously assumed. This result strengthens the correlation between high metallicity and the presence of gas giants around low mass stars. At 15.3 pc, the minimal astrometric amplitude for planet candidate GJ 317b is 0.3 milliarcseconds (edge-on orbit), just below our astrometric sensitivity. However, given the relatively large number of observations and good astrometric precision, a Bayesian Monte Carlo Markov Chain analysis indicates that the mass of planet b has to be smaller than twice the minimum mass with a 99% confidence level, with a most likely value of 2.5 Mjup. Additional RV measurements obtained with Keck by the Lick-Carnegie Planet search program confirm the presence of an additional very long period planet candidate, with a period of 20 years or more. Even though such an object will imprint a large astrometric wobble on the star, its curvature is yet not evident in the astrometry. Given high metallicity, and the trend indicating that multiple systems are rich in low mass companions, this system is likely to host additional low mass planets in its habitable zone that can be readily detected with state-of-the-art optical and near infrared RV measurements. "
"The cost of LTL model checking is highly sensitive to the length of the formula under verification. We observe that, under some specific conditions, the input LTL formula can be reduced to an easier-to-handle one before model checking. In our reduction, these two formulae need not to be logically equivalent, but they share the same counterexample set w.r.t the model. In the case that the model is symbolically represented, the condition enabling such reduction can be detected with a lightweight effort (e.g., with SAT-solving). In this paper, we tentatively name such technique ""Counterexample-Preserving Reduction"" (CePRe for short), and finally the proposed technquie is experimentally evaluated by adapting NuSMV. "
"Much work has been devoted to studying percolation of networks and interdependent networks under varying levels of failures. Researchers have considered many different realistic network structures, but thus far no study has incorporated the hierarchical structure of many networks. For example, infrastructure across cities will likely be distributed such that nodes are tightly connected within small neighborhoods, somewhat less connected across the whole city, and have even fewer connections between cities. Furthermore, while previous work identified interconnected nodes, those nodes with links outside their neighborhood, to be more likely to be attacked, here we have various levels of interconnections (between neighborhoods, between cities, etc.). We consider the nodes with interconnections at the highest level most likely to be attacked, followed by those with interconnections at the next level, etc. We develop an analytic solution for both single and interdependent networks of this structure and verify our theory through simulations. We find that depending on the number of levels in the hierarchy there may be multiple transitions in the giant component (fraction of interconnected nodes), as the network separates at the various levels. Our results show that these multiple jumps are a feature of hierarchical networks and can affect the vulnerability of infrastructure networks. "
"We investigate recent claims concerning a new class of cosmic string solutions in the Weinberg-Salam model. They have the general form of previously discussed semi-local and electroweak strings, but are modified by the presence of a non-zero W-condensate in the core of the string. We explicitly construct such solutions for arbitrary values of the winding number $N$. We then prove that they are gauge equivalent to bare electroweak strings with winding number $N-1$. We also develop new asymptotic expressions for large-$N$ strings. "
"RR Lyrae pulsating stars have been extensively used as tracers of old stellar populations for the purpose of determining the ages of galaxies, and as tools to measure distances to nearby galaxies. There was accordingly considerable interest when the RR Lyr star OGLE-BLG-RRLYR-02792 was found to be a member in an eclipsing binary system4, as the mass of the pulsator (hitherto constrained only by models) could be unambiguously determined. Here we report that RRLYR-02792 has a mass of 0.26 M_sun and therefore cannot be a classical RR Lyrae star. Through models we find that its properties are best explained by the evolution of a close binary system that started with 1.4 M_sun and 0.8 M_sun stars orbiting each other with an initial period of 2.9 days. Mass exchange over 5.4 Gyr produced the observed system, which is now in a very short-lived phase where the physical properties of the pulsator happen to place it in the same instability strip of the H-R diagram occupied by RR Lyrae stars. We estimate that samples of RR Lyr stars may contain a 0.2 percent contamination with systems similar to this one, implying that distances measured with RR Lyrae stars should not be significantly affected by these binary interlopers. "
"A variety of experimental searches and theoretical efforts have constrained gluinos that undergo an all-hadronic decay with no missing energy, as can arise in R-parity violating or stealth supersymmetry. Although the gluino->jj decay is robustly excluded, there is gap in current experimental coverage for gluinos with masses between 51-76 GeV that decay into three light-flavor quarks. In this work, we probe this gap with published multi-jet data from the UA2 experiment. Despite setting the strongest current limit on this region, we find that UA2 data is unable to close this gap for gluino->jjj decays. In addition to this three-jet gap, we note an additional gap for all-hadronic gluino -> n parton decays with $n\geq 4$ for light gluinos (51 GeV < m < 300 GeV) not covered by the current search program. "
"We present the workflow of a DSM refinement methodology using a Hybrid-cGAN where the generative part consists of two encoders and a common decoder which blends the spectral and height information within one network. The inputs to the Hybrid-cGAN are single-channel photogrammetric DSMs with continuous values and single-channel pan-chromatic (PAN) half-meter resolution satellite images. Experimental results demonstrate that the earlier information fusion from data with different physical meanings helps to propagate fine details and complete an inaccurate or missing 3D information about building forms. Moreover, it improves the building boundaries making them more rectilinear. "
"Let $P$ be a set of $n$ points in an axis-parallel rectangle $B$ in the plane. We present an $O(n\alpha(n)\log^4 n)$-time algorithm to preprocess $P$ into a data structure of size $O(n\alpha(n)\log^3 n)$, such that, given a query point $q$, we can find, in $O(\log^4 n)$ time, the largest-area axis-parallel rectangle that is contained in $B$, contains $q$, and its interior contains no point of $P$. This is a significant improvement over the previous solution of Augustine {\em et al.} \cite{qmex}, which uses slightly superquadratic preprocessing and storage. "
"The estimation and control of resource usage is now an important challenge in an increasing number of computing systems. In particular, requirements on timing and energy arise in a wide variety of applications such as internet of things, cloud computing, health, transportation, and robots. At the same time, parallel computing, with (heterogeneous) multi-core platforms in particular, has become the dominant paradigm in computer architecture. Predicting resource usage on such platforms poses a difficult challenge. Most work on static resource analysis has focused on sequential programs, and relatively little progress has been made on the analysis of parallel programs, or more specifically on parallel logic programs. We propose a novel, general, and flexible framework for setting up cost equations/relations which can be instantiated for performing resource usage analysis of parallel logic programs for a wide range of resources, platforms and execution models. The analysis estimates both lower and upper bounds on the resource usage of a parallel program (without executing it) as functions on input data sizes. In addition, it also infers other meaningful information to better exploit and assess the potential and actual parallelism of a system. We develop a method for solving cost relations involving the max function that arise in the analysis of parallel programs. Finally, we instantiate our general framework for the analysis of logic programs with Independent And-Parallelism, report on an implementation within the CiaoPP system, and provide some experimental results. To our knowledge, this is the first approach to the cost analysis of parallel logic programs. "
The RICH counter of the AMS experiment is described and its expected performances are discussed. Prototype results are reported.
"The luminosity variation of a stellar source due to the gravitational microlensing effect can be considered also if the light rays are defocused (instead of focused) toward the observer. In this case, we should detect a gap instead of a peak in the light curve of the source. Actually, we describe how the phenomenon depends on the relative position of source and lens with respect to the observer: if the lens is between, we have focusing, if the lens is behind, we have defocusing. It is shown that the number of events with predicted gaps is equal to the number of events with peaks in the light curves. "
"Dimensional reduction of high dimensional data can be achieved by keeping only the relevant eigenmodes after principal component analysis. However, differentiating relevant eigenmodes from the random noise eigenmodes is problematic. A new method based on the random matrix theory and a statistical goodness-of-fit test is proposed in this paper. It is validated by numerical simulations and applied to real-time magnetic resonance cardiac cine images. "
"We present the program package NMSSMCALC for the calculation of the loop-corrected NMSSM Higgs boson masses and decay widths in the CP-conserving and CP-violating NMSSM. The full one-loop corrections to the Higgs boson masses are evaluated in a mixed renormalisation scheme of on-shell and $\overline{\mbox{DR}}$ conditions. The Higgs decay widths include the dominant higher order QCD corrections, and the decays into bottom quarks, strange quarks and tau leptons are supplemented by higher order SUSY corrections through effective couplings. All relevant off-shell decays into two massive gauge bosons, gauge and Higgs boson and Higgs pair final states as well as into heavy quark pairs are computed. The input and output files feature the SUSY Les Houches Accord so that the program can easily be linked with existing computer tools. "
"Fix an integer $\kappa\geqslant 2$. Let $P$ be prime and let $k> \kappa$ be an even integer. For $f$ a holomorphic cusp form of weight $k$ and full level and $g$ a primitive holomorphic cusp form of weight $2 \kappa$ and level $P$, we prove hybrid subconvexity bounds for $L \left(\tfrac{1}{2}, \text{Sym}^2 f \otimes g\right)$ in the $k$ and $P$ aspects when $P^{\frac {13} {64} + \delta} < k < P^{\frac 3 8 - \delta}$ for any $0 < \delta < \frac {11} {128}$. These bounds are achieved through a first moment method (with amplification when $P^{\frac {13} {64}} < k \leqslant P^{\frac 4 {13}}$). "
"Three-body collisions of ultracold identical Bose atoms under tight cylindrical confinement are analyzed. A Feshbach resonance in two-body collisions is described by a two-channel zero-range interaction. Elimination of the closed channel in the three-body problem reduces the interaction to a one-channel zero-range one with an energy dependent strength. The related problem with an energy independent strength (the Lieb-Liniger-McGuire model) has an exact solution and forbids all chemical processes, such as three-atom association and diatom dissociation, as well as reflection in atom-diatom collisions. The resonant case is analyzed by a numerical solution of the Faddeev-Lovelace equations. The results demonstrate that as the internal symmetry of the Lieb-Liniger-McGuire model is lifted, the reflection and chemical reactions become allowed and may be observed in experiments. "
"We prove the existence and uniqueness of the solutions of some very general type of degenerate complex Monge-Amp\`ere equations. This type of equations is precisely what is needed in order to construct K\""ahler-Einstein metrics over irreducible singular K\""ahler spaces with ample or trivial canonical sheaf and singular K\""ahler-Einstein metrics over varieties of general type. "
"We introduce a technique for showing classical knots and links are not slice. As one application we show that the iterated Bing doubles of many algebraically slice knots are not topologically slice. Some of the proofs do not use the existence of the Cheeger-Gromov bound, a deep analytical tool used by Cochran-Teichner. We define generalized doubling operators, of which Bing doubling is an instance, and prove our nontriviality results in this more general context. Our main examples are boundary links that cannot be detected in the algebraic boundary link concordance group. "
"In quantum computation every unitary operation can be decomposed into quantum circuits-a series of single-qubit rotations and a single type entangling two-qubit gates, such as controlled-NOT (CNOT) gates. Two measures are important when judging the complexity of the circuit: the total number of CNOT gates needed to implement it and the depth of the circuit, measured by the minimal number of computation steps needed to perform it. Here we give an explicit and simple quantum circuit scheme for preparation of arbitrary quantum states, which can directly utilize any decomposition scheme for arbitrary full quantum gates, thus connecting the two problems. Our circuit reduces the depth of the best currently known circuit by a factor of 2. It also reduces the total number of CNOT gates from 2^n to 23/24 2^n in the leading order for even number of qubits. Specifically, the scheme allows us to decrease the upper bound from 11 CNOT gates to 9 and the depth from 11 to 5 steps for four qubits. Our results are expected to help in designing and building small-scale quantum circuits using present technologies. "
"We aim to present a comprehensive theoretical investigation of dielectronic recombination (DR) of the silicon-like isoelectronic sequence and provide DR and radiative recombination (RR) data that can be used within a generalized collisional-radiative modelling framework. Total and final-state level-resolved DR and RR rate coefficients for the ground and metastable initial levels of 16 ions between $\rm{P^{+}}$ and $\rm{Zn^{16+}}$ are determined. We carried out multi-configurational Breit-Pauli (MCBP) DR calculations for silicon-like ions in the independent processes, isolated resonance, distorted wave (IPIRDW) approximation. Both $\Delta n_c =0$ and $\Delta n_c =1$ core excitations are included using $LS$ and intermediate coupling schemes. Results are presented for a selected number of ions and compared to all other existing theoretical and experimental data. The total dielectronic and radiative recombination rate coefficients for the ground state are presented in tabulated form for easy implementation into spectral modelling codes. These data can also be accessed from the Atomic Data and Analysis Structure (ADAS) OPEN-ADAS database. This work is a part of an assembly of a dielectronic recombination database for the modelling of dynamic finite-density plasmas. "
"Purpose: To study placental function - both perfusion and an oxygenation surrogate (T2*)-simultaneously and quantitatively in-vivo. Methods: 15 pregnant women were scanned on a 3T MR scanner. For perfusion measurements, a velocity selective arterial spin labelling preparation module was placed before a multi-echo gradient echo EPI readout to integrate T2* and perfusion measurements in one joint perfusion-oxygenation (PERFOX) acquisition. Joint motion correction and quantification were performed to evaluate changes in T2* and perfusion over GA. Results: The optimised integrated PERFOX protocol and post-processing allowed successful visualization and quantification of perfusion and T2* in all subjects. Areas of high T2* and high perfusion appear to correspond to placental sub-units and show a systematic offset in location along the maternal-fetal axis. The areas of highest perfusion are consistently closer to the maternal basal plate and the areas of highest T2* closer to the fetal chorionic plate. Quantitative results show a strong negative correlation of gestational age with T2* and weak negative correlation with perfusion. Conclusion: A strength of the joint sequence is that it provides truly simultaneous and co-registered estimates of local T2* and perfusion, however, to achieve this, the time per slice is prolonged compared to a perfusion only scan which can potentially limit coverage. The achieved interlocking can be particularly useful when quantifying transient physiological effects such as uterine contractions. PERFOX opens a new avenue to elucidate the relationship between maternal supply and oxygen uptake, both of which are central to placental function and dysfunction. "
This paper is a sequel to [1] and considers definability in differential-henselian monotone fields with c-map and angular component map. We prove an Equivalence Theorem among whose consequences are a relative quantifier reduction and an NIP result.
"A trapped atom interferometer involving state-selective adiabatic potentials with two microwave frequencies on a chip is proposed. We show that this configuration provides a way to achieve a high degree of symmetry between the two arms of the interferometer, which is necessary for coherent splitting and recombination of thermal (i.e. non-condensed) atoms. The resulting interferometer holds promise to achieve high contrast and long coherence time, while avoiding the mean-field interaction issues of interferometers based on trapped Bose-Einstein condenstates.

"The magnetic field pervading our Galaxy is a crucial constituent of the interstellar medium: it mediates the dynamics of interstellar clouds, the energy density of cosmic rays, and the formation of stars. The field associated with ionized interstellar gas has been determined through observations of pulsars in our Galaxy. Radio-frequency measurements of pulse dispersion and the rotation of the plane of linear polarization, i.e., Faraday rotation, yield an average value B ~ 3 microGauss. The possible detection of Faraday rotation of linearly polarized photons emitted by high-redshift quasars suggests similar magnetic fields are present in foreground galaxies with redshifts z > 1. As Faraday rotation alone, however, determines neither the magnitude nor the redshift of the magnetic field, the strength of galactic magnetic fields at redshifts z > 0 remains uncertain. Here we report a measurement of a magnetic field of B ~ 84 microGauss in a galaxy at z =0.692, using the same Zeeman-splitting technique that revealed an average value of B = 6 microGauss in the neutral interstellar gas of our Galaxy. This is unexpected, as the leading theory of magnetic field generation, the mean-field dynamo model, predicts large-scale magnetic fields to be weaker in the past rather than stronger. "
The recent LHCb data for exclusive $J/\psi$ peripheral production at 13 TeV motivate an improved `NLO' analysis to estimate the gluon distribution at low $x$ in which we re-calculate the rapidity gap survival factors and use a more precise expression for the photon flux. We comment on the difference between the $k_T$ and collinear factorization approaches.
"Using recently evaluated contributions (including a novel one calculated here), we present updated values for the pole mass and $\bar{MS}$ mass of the $b$ quark: $m_b=5022\pm58$ MeV, for the pole mass, and $\bar{m}_b(\bar{m}_b)=4286\pm36$ MeV for the $\bar{MS}$ one. These values are accurate including, respectively, $O(\alpha_s^5\log\alpha_s)$ and $O(\alpha_s^3)$ corrections and, in both cases, leading orders in the ratio $m_c^2/m_b^2$. "
"We show that a stochastic flow which is generated by a stochastic differential equation on $\R^d$ with bounded volatility has a random attractor provided that the drift component in the direction towards the origin is larger than a certain strictly positive constant $\beta$ outside a large ball. Using a similar approach, we provide a lower bound for the linear growth rate of the inner radius of the image of a large ball under a stochastic flow in case the drift component in the direction away from the origin is larger than a certain strictly positive constant $\beta$ outside a large ball. To prove the main result we use chaining techniques in order to control the growth of the diameter of subsets of the state space under the flow. "
"The first fermion family might play a key role in understanding the structure of flavour: a role of the mass unification point. The GUT scale running masses $\bar{m}_{e,u,d}$ are rather close, which may indicate an approximate symmetry limit. Following this observation, we present a new predictive approach based on the SUSY $SO(10)$ theory with $\tan\beta\sim 1$. The inter-family hierarchy is first generated in a sector of hypothetical superheavy fermions and then transfered inversely to ordinary quarks and leptons by means of the universal seesaw mechanism. The Yukawa matrices are simply parametrized by the small complex coefficients $\eps_{u,d,e}$ which are related by the $SO(10)$ symmetry properties. Their values are determined by the ratio of the GUT scale $M_X\simeq 10^{16}$ GeV to a higher (possibly string) scale $M\simeq 10^{17}-10^{18}$ GeV. The suggested ansatz correctly reproduces the fermion mass and mixing pattern. By taking as input the masses of leptons and $c$ and $b$ quarks, the ratio $m_s/m_d$ and the value of the Cabibbo angle, we compute the $u,d,s$ quark masses, top mass and $\tan\beta$. The top quark is naturally in the 100 GeV range, but with upper limit $M_t<165$ GeV, while the lower bound $M_t>160$ GeV implies $m_s/m_d>22$. $\tan\beta$ can vary from 1.4 to 1.7. The proton decaying $d=5$ operators $qqql$ are naturally suppressed. "
"Let $f:A \to B$ be a ring homomorphism of not necessarily unital rings and $I\triangleleft A$ an ideal which is mapped by f isomorphically to an ideal of B. The obstruction to excision in K-theory is the failure of the map between relative K-groups $K_*(A:I) \to K_*(B:f(I))$ to be an isomorphism; it is measured by the birelative groups $K_*(A,B:I)$. We show that these are rationally isomorphic to the corresponding birelative groups for cyclic homology up to a dimension shift. In the particular case when A and B are $\Q$-algebras we obtain an integral isomorphism. "
"This paper pursues the study carried out by the authors in ""Stability and Hopf bifurcation in a hexagonal governor system"", focusing on the codimension one Hopf bifurcations in the hexagonal Watt governor differential system. Here are studied the codimension two, three and four Hopf bifurcations and the pertinent Lyapunov stability coefficients and bifurcation diagrams, ilustrating the number, types and positions of bifurcating small amplitude periodic orbits, are determined. As a consequence it is found an open region in the parameter space where two attracting periodic orbits coexist with an attracting equilibrium point. "
"The suitability of a transportable 3He-spin filter as temporary broadband polarizer for a Time-of-Flight neutron reflectometer is demonstrated. A simple two-wavelength method for characterisation of a 3He-spin filter is proposed, which can be applied even if the absolute transmittance of the 3He-spin filter cannot be accurately determined. We demonstrate the data treatment procedure for extracting the spin-up and spin-down neutron reflectivity from measurements obtained with a time dependent 3He polarization. The extraction of a very weak magnetic signal from reflectivity data, measured on the in-situ grown magnetic heterostructure Fe1 nm/Cu20 nm/Sisubstrate in an externally applied magnetic field of 30mT is presented and compared to similar measurements on the growth stage Cu20 nm/Sisubstrate of the very same sample, which does not yet contain any magnetic material. "
"In this paper we consider connections between Ricci solitons and Einstein metrics on homogeneous spaces. We show that a semi-algebraic Ricci soliton admits an Einstein one-dimensional extension if the soliton derivation can be chosen to be normal. Using our previous work on warped product Einstein metrics, we show that every normal semi-algebraic Ricci soliton also admits a $k$-dimensional Einstein extension for any $k\geq 2$. We also prove converse theorems for these constructions and some geometric and topological structure results for homogeneous warped product Einstein metrics. In the appendix we give an alternative approach to semi-algebraic Ricci solitons which naturally leads to a definition of semi-algebraic Ricci solitons in the non-homogeneous setting. "
"By the combination of optical tweezer manipulation and digital video microscopy, the flexural rigidity of single glycolipid ""nano"" tubes has been measured below the transition temperature at which the lipid tubules are transformed into vesicles. Consequently, we have found a clear reduction of the rigidity obviously before the transition as temperature increasing. Further experiments of infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR) and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) have suggested a microscopic change of the tube walls, synchronizing with the precursory softening of the nanotubes. "
"We compute analytically the mean number of common sites, W_N(t), visited by N independent random walkers each of length t and all starting at the origin at t=0 in d dimensions. We show that in the (N-d) plane, there are three distinct regimes for the asymptotic large t growth of W_N(t). These three regimes are separated by two critical lines d=2 and d=d_c(N)=2N/(N-1) in the (N-d) plane. For d<2, W_N(t)\sim t^{d/2} for large t (the N dependence is only in the prefactor). For 2<d<d_c(N), W_N(t)\sim t^{\nu} where the exponent \nu= N-d(N-1)/2 varies with N and d. For d>d_c(N), W_N(t) approaches a constant as t\to \infty. Exactly at the critical dimensions there are logaritmic corrections: for d=2, we get W_N(t)\sim t/[\ln t]^N, while for d=d_c(N), W_N(t)\sim \ln t for large t. Our analytical predictions are verified in numerical simulations. "
"In [12] it has been shown that $(p,q)$ Sobolev inequality with $p>q$ implies the doubling condition on the underlying measure. We show that even weaker Orlicz-Sobolev inequalities, where the gain on the left-hand side is smaller than any power bump, imply doubling. Moreover, we derive a condition on the quantity that should replace the radius on the righ-hand side (which we call `superradius'), that is necessary to ensure that the space can support the Orlicz-Sobolev inequality and simultaneously be non-doubling. "
"We combine Sloan Digital Sky Survey spectra of 22,000 luminous, red, bulge-dominated galaxies to get high S/N average spectra in the rest-frame optical and ultraviolet (2600A to 7000A). The average spectra of these massive, quiescent galaxies are early-type with weak emission lines and with absorption lines indicating an apparent excess of alpha elements over solar abundance ratios. We make average spectra of subsamples selected by luminosity, environment and redshift. The average spectra are remarkable in their similarity. What variations do exist in the average spectra as a function of luminosity and environment are found to form a nearly one-parameter family in spectrum space. We present a high signal-to-noise ratio spectrum of the variation. We measure the properties of the variation with a modified version of the Lick index system and compare to model spectra from stellar population syntheses. The variation may be a combination of age and chemical abundance differences, but the conservative conclusion is that the quality of the data considerably exceeds the current state of the models. "
We consider the Moutard transformation which is a two-dimensional version of the well-known Darboux transformation. We give an algebraic interpretation of the Moutard transformation as a conjugation in an appropriate ring and the corresponding version of the algebro-geometric formalism for two-dimensional Schroedinger operators. An application to some problems of the spectral theory of two-dimensional Schroedinger operators and to the $(2+1)$-dimensional Novikov--Veselov equation is sketched.
"Objective: To establish the performance of several drive and measurement patterns in EIT imaging of neural activity in peripheral nerve, which involves large impedance change in the nerve's anisotropic length axis. Approach: Eight drive and measurement electrode patterns are compared using a finite element (FE) four cylindrical shell model of a peripheral nerve and a 32 channel dual-ring nerve cuff. The central layer of the FE model contains impedance changes representative of neural activity of -0.3 in the length axis and -8.8 x 10-4 in the radial axis. Four of the electrode patterns generate longitudinal drive current, which runs perpendicular to the anisotropic axis. Main results: Transverse current patterns produce higher resolution than longitudinal patterns but are also more susceptible to noise and errors, and exhibit poorer sensitivity to impedance changes in central sample locations. Three of the four longitudinal current patterns considered can reconstruct fascicle level impedance changes with up to 0.2 mV noise and error, which corresponds to between -5.5 and +0.18 dB of the normalised signal standard deviation. Reducing the spacing between the two electrode rings in all longitudinal current patterns reduced the signal to error ratio across all depth locations of the sample. Significance: Electrode patterns which target the large impedance change in the anisotropic length axis can provide improved robustness against noise and errors, which is a critical step towards real time EIT imaging of neural activity in peripheral nerve.

I review the construction of an action for open superstring field theory which does not suffer from the contact term problems of other approaches. I also discuss a possible generalization of this action for closed superstring field theory.

"We present Hubble Space Telescope imaging confirming the optical disappearance of the failed supernova (SN) candidate identified by Gerke et al. (2015). This $\sim 25~M_{\odot}$ red supergiant experienced a weak $\sim 10^{6}~L_{\odot}$ optical outburst in 2009 and is now at least 5 magnitudes fainter than the progenitor in the optical. The mid-IR flux has slowly decreased to the lowest levels since the first measurements in 2004. There is faint ($2000-3000~L_{\odot}$) near-IR emission likely associated with the source. We find the late-time evolution of the source to be inconsistent with obscuration from an ejected, dusty shell. Models of the spectral energy distribution indicate that the remaining bolometric luminosity is $>6$ times fainter than that of the progenitor and is decreasing as $\sim t^{-4/3}$. We conclude that the transient is unlikely to be a SN impostor or stellar merger. The event is consistent with the ejection of the envelope of a red supergiant in a failed SN and the late-time emission could be powered by fallback accretion onto a newly-formed black hole. Future IR and X-ray observations are needed to confirm this interpretation of the fate for the star. "
"We study the response of graphene to high-intensity 10^11-10^12 Wcm^-2, 50-femtosecond laser pulse excitation. We establish that graphene has a fairly high (~3\times10^12Wcm^-2) single-shot damage threshold. Above this threshold, a single laser pulse cleanly ablates graphene, leaving microscopically defined edges. Below this threshold, we observe laser-induced defect formation that leads to degradation of the lattice over multiple exposures. We identify the lattice modification processes through in-situ Raman microscopy. The effective lifetime of CVD graphene under femtosecond near-IR irradiation and its dependence on laser intensity is determined. These results also define the limits of non-linear applications of graphene in femtosecond high-intensity regime. "
"A wide class of skew derivations on degree-one generalized Weyl algebras $R(a,\varphi)$ over a ring $R$ is constructed. All these derivations are twisted by a degree-counting extensions of automorphisms of $R$. It is determined which of the constructed derivations are $Q$-skew derivations. The compatibility of these skew derivations with the natural ${\mathbb Z}$-grading of $R(a,\varphi)$ is studied. Additional classes of skew derivations are constructed for generalized Weyl algebras given by an automorphism $\varphi$ of a finite order. Conditions that the central element $a$ that forms part of the structure of $R(a,\varphi)$ need to satisfy for the orthogonality of pairs of aforementioned skew derivations are derived. General constructions are illustrated by classification of skew derivations of generalized Weyl algebras over the polynomial ring in one variable and with a linear polynomial as the central element.

"Measurement of neutral pions and direct photons are closely connected experimentally, on the other hand they probe quite different aspects of relativistic heavy ion collisions. In this short review of the $\pi^0$ results from the PHENIX experiment at RHIC our focus is on the $\phi$-integrated nuclear modification factor, its energy and system size dependence, and the impact of these results on parton energy loss models. We also discuss the current status of high $p_T$ and thermal direct photon measurements both in $p$ + $p$ and Au+Au collisions. Recognizing the advantages of measuring not only the ""signal"", but also all the ""references"" needed for proper interpretation in the same experiments (with same or similar systematics) we argue that RHIC should regularly include $d$ + A and even $d$ + $d$ collisions into its system size and energy scan.

"Stochastic restart may drastically reduce the expected run time of a computer algorithm, expedite the completion of a complex search process, or increase the turnover rate of an enzymatic reaction. These diverse first-passage-time (FPT) processes seem to have very little in common but it is actually quite the other way around. Here we show that the relative standard deviation associated with the FPT of an optimally restarted process, i.e., one that is restarted at a (non-zero) rate which brings the mean FPT to a minimum, is always unity. We interpret, further generalize, and discuss this finding and the implications arising from it. "
"Generalized linear models (GLMs) using a regression procedure to fit relationships between predictor and target variables are widely used in automobile insurance data. Here, in the process of ratemaking and in order to compute the premiums to be charged to the policy--holders it is crucial to detect the relevant variables which affect to the value of the premium since in this case the insurer could eventually fix more precisely the premiums. We propose here a methodology with a different perspective. Instead of the exponential family we pay attention to the Power Series Distributions and develop a Bayesian methodology using sampling--based methods in order to detect relevant variables in automobile insurance data set. This model, as the GLMs, allows to incorporate the presence of an excessive number of zero counts and overdispersion phenomena (variance larger than the mean). Following this spirit, in this paper we present a novel and flexible zero--inflated Bayesian regression model. This model includes other familiar models such as the zero--inflated Poisson and zero--inflated geometric models, as special cases. A Bayesian estimation method is developed as an alternative to traditionally used maximum likelihood based methods to analyze such data. For a real data collected from 2004 to 2005 in an Australian insurance company an example is provided by using Markov Chain Monte Carlo method which is developed in WinBUGS package. The results show that the new Bayesian method performs the previous models. "
"The spin-polarization and magnetic coupling character of N-doped SrTiO3 and BaTiO3 are studied through first-principles calculations. The substitutional N doping at O sites leads to a half-metallic property and produces a magnetic moment of 1.0 {\mu}B. The magnetic interaction between the nearest and next-nearest N dopants results in a strong ferromagnetic coupling. When the distance between the N dopants is larger than 7 {\AA}, the ground state of the system tends to be paramagnetic. A nitrogen-concentration threshold to produce the ferromagnetism is estimated. The calculated results give a good explanation for the experimentally observed ferromagnetism in N-doped SrTiO3 and BaTiO3. "
"The dominant cost in production machine learning workloads is not training individual models but serving predictions from increasingly complex prediction pipelines spanning multiple models, machine learning frameworks, and parallel hardware accelerators. Due to the complex interaction between model configurations and parallel hardware, prediction pipelines are challenging to provision and costly to execute when serving interactive latency-sensitive applications. This challenge is exacerbated by the unpredictable dynamics of bursty workloads. In this paper we introduce InferLine, a system which efficiently provisions and executes ML inference pipelines subject to end-to-end latency constraints by proactively optimizing and reactively controlling per-model configuration in a fine-grained fashion. Unpredictable changes in the serving workload are dynamically and cost-optimally accommodated with minimal service level degradation. InferLine introduces (1) automated model profiling and pipeline lineage extraction, (2) a fine-grain, cost-minimizing pipeline configuration planner, and (3) a fine-grain reactive controller. InferLine is able to configure and deploy prediction pipelines across a wide range of workload patterns and latency goals. It outperforms coarse-grained configuration alternatives by up 7.6x in cost while achieving up to 32x lower SLO miss rate on real workloads and generalizes across state-of-the-art model serving frameworks. "
We show that a two-dimensional (2D) array of 1D interacting boson tubes has a deconfinement transition between a 1D Mott insulator and a 3D superfluid for commensurate fillings and a dimensional crossover for the incommensurate case. We determine the phase diagram and excitations of this system and discuss the consequences for Bose condensates loaded in 2D optical lattices.
"Neurons in the nervous system convey information to higher brain regions by the generation of spike trains. An important question in the field of computational neuroscience is how these sensory neurons encode environmental information in a way which may be simply analyzed by subsequent systems. Many aspects of the form and function of the nervous system have been understood using the concepts of optimal population coding. Most studies, however, have neglected the aspect of temporal coding. Here we address this shortcoming through a filtering theory of inhomogeneous Poisson processes. We derive exact relations for the minimal mean squared error of the optimal Bayesian filter and by optimizing the encoder, obtain optimal codes for populations of neurons. We also show that a class of non-Markovian, smooth stimuli are amenable to the same treatment, and provide results for the filtering and prediction error which hold for a general class of stochastic processes. This sets a sound mathematical framework for a population coding theory that takes temporal aspects into account. It also formalizes a number of studies which discussed temporal aspects of coding using time-window paradigms, by stating them in terms of correlation times and firing rates. We propose that this kind of analysis allows for a systematic study of temporal coding and will bring further insights into the nature of the neural code. "
"I will survey some matters of relevance to a philosophical discussion of information, taking into account developments in algorithmic information theory (AIT). I will propose that meaning is deep in the sense of Bennett's logical depth, and that algorithmic probability may provide the stability needed for a robust algorithmic definition of meaning, one that takes into consideration the interpretation and the recipient's own knowledge encoded in the story attached to a message.

"Observations of molecular gas near the Galactic centre ($| l | < 10^\circ$, $| b | < 1^\circ$) reveal the presence of a distinct population of enigmatic compact clouds which are characterised by extreme velocity dispersions ($\Delta v > 100\, \rm km/s$). These Extended Velocity Features (EVFs) are very prominent in the datacubes and dominate the kinematics of molecular gas just outside the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ). The prototypical example of such a cloud is Bania Clump 2. We show that similar features are naturally produced in simulations of gas flow in a realistic barred potential. We analyse the structure of the features obtained in the simulations and use this to interpret the observations. We find that the features arise from collisions between material that has been infalling rapidly along the dust lanes of the Milky Way bar and material that belongs to one of the following two categories: (i) material that has `overshot' after falling down the dust lanes on the opposite side; (ii) material which is part of the CMZ. Both types of collisions involve gas with large differences in the line-of-sight velocities, which is what produces the observed extreme velocity dispersions. Examples of both categories can be identified in the observations. If our interpretation is correct, we are directly witnessing (a) collisions of clouds with relative speeds of $\sim 200\, \rm km/s$ and (b) the process of accretion of fresh gas onto the CMZ. "
"Given an arrangement of lines in the plane, what is the minimum number $c$ of colors required to color the lines so that no cell of the arrangement is monochromatic? In this paper we give bounds on the number c both for the above question, as well as some of its variations. We redefine these problems as geometric hypergraph coloring problems. If we define $\Hlinecell$ as the hypergraph where vertices are lines and edges represent cells of the arrangement, the answer to the above question is equal to the chromatic number of this hypergraph. We prove that this chromatic number is between $\Omega (\log n / \log\log n)$. and $O(\sqrt{n})$. Similarly, we give bounds on the minimum size of a subset $S$ of the intersections of the lines in $\mathcal{A}$ such that every cell is bounded by at least one of the vertices in $S$. This may be seen as a problem on guarding cells with vertices when the lines act as obstacles. The problem can also be defined as the minimum vertex cover problem in the hypergraph $\Hvertexcell$, the vertices of which are the line intersections, and the hyperedges are vertices of a cell. Analogously, we consider the problem of touching the lines with a minimum subset of the cells of the arrangement, which we identify as the minimum vertex cover problem in the $\Hcellzone$ hypergraph.

"Let $R$ be a ring with identity $1$. Jacobson's lemma states that for any $a,b\in R$, if $1-ab$ is invertible then so is $1-ba$. Jacobson's lemma has suitable analogues for several types of generalized inverses, e.g., Drazin inverse, generalized Drazin inverse, and inner inverse. In this note we give a constructive way via Groebner-Shirshov basis theory to obtain the inverse of $1-ab$ in terms of $(1-ba)^{-1}$, assuming the latter exists. "
"We present measurements of the inclusive jet production at centre-of-mass energies of 8 and 13 TeV, and of multijets at 8 TeV. These measurements allow to constrain PDFs and the strong coupling constant. Two measurements of the azimuthal correlations at 8 and 13 TeV are also presented, testing higher order QCD calculations. "
"The decoherence effect on Grover algorithm has been studied numerically through a noise modelled by a depolarizing channel. Two types of error are introduced characterizing the qubit time evolution and gate application, so the noise is directly related to the quantum network construction. The numerical simulation concludes an exponential damping law for the successive probability of the maxima as time increases. We have obtained an allowed-error law for the algorithm: the error threshold for the allowed noise behaves as Eth(N) ~ 1/N1.1 (N being the size of the data set). As the power of N is almost one, we consider the Grover algorithm as robust to a certain extent against decoherence. This law also provides an absolute threshold: if the free evolution error is greater than 0.043, Grover algorithm does not work for any number of qubits affected by the present error model. The improvement in the probability of success, in the case of two qubits has been illustrated by using a fault-tolerant encoding of the initial state by means of the [[7,1,3]] quantum code. "
"We study the question weather weak solutions to a class of active scalar equations, with the drift velocity and the active scalar related via a Fourier multiplier of order zero, are unique. Due to some recent results we cannot expect weak solutions to be unique without additional conditions. We analyze the case of some integrability conditions on the gradient of the solutions. The condition is weaker than simply imposing $\nabla \theta \in L^\infty$. Lastly, we consider the inviscid limit for the studied class of equations. "
"The low energy part of the FAST linear accelerator based on 1.3 GHz superconducting RF cavities was successfully commissioned. During commissioning, beam based model dependent methods were used to correct linear lattice and trajectory. Lattice correction algorithm is based on analysis of beam shape from profile monitors and trajectory responses to dipole correctors. Trajectory responses to field gradient variations in quadrupoles and phase variations in superconducting RF cavities were used to correct bunch offsets in quadrupoles and accelerating cavities relative to their magnetic axes. Details of used methods and experimental results are presented. "
"A sterile neutrino with mass of several keV is a well-motivated dark-matter candidate, and it can also explain the observed velocities of pulsars via anisotropic emission of sterile neutrinos from a cooling neutron star. We discuss the interactions of such relic particles with matter and comment on the prospects of future direct detection experiments. A relic sterile neutrino can interact, via sterile-active mixing, with matter fermions by means of electroweak currents, with the final state containing a relativistic active neutrino. The recoil momentum impacted onto a matter fermion is determined by the sterile neutrino mass and is enough to ionize atoms and flip the spins of nuclei. While this suggests a possibility of direct experimental detection, we calculate the rates and show that building a realistic detector of the required size would be a daunting challenge. "
"The nearest massive star-forming complex, Cygnus-X, is widely used as a laboratory for star cluster formation and feedback processes, under the implicit assumption that all its components are located roughly at the same distance. We present a multi-wavelength study of a 15' x 15' field in southern Cygnus-X, where different components involving clustered star formation are overlapped. Preliminary results indicate that the Berkeley 87 and [DB2001] CL05 clusters are actually located at very different distances, invalidating previous claims of physical interaction between them. This shows the importance of a careful treatment of extinction and distance calculations for cluster formation studies, particularly in Cygnus-X. "
"Following Almgren's construction of the ""center manifold"" in his Big regularity paper, we show the C^{3,\alpha} regularity of area-minimizing currents in the neighborhood of points of density one without using the nonparametric theory. This study is intended as a first step towards the understanding of Almgren's construction in its full generality. "
"We present an explicit formula for computing toric residues as a quotient of two determinants, a la Macaulay, where the numerator is a minor of the denominator.

"In this work, we present an approach to deep visuomotor control using structured deep dynamics models. Our deep dynamics model, a variant of SE3-Nets, learns a low-dimensional pose embedding for visuomotor control via an encoder-decoder structure. Unlike prior work, our dynamics model is structured: given an input scene, our network explicitly learns to segment salient parts and predict their pose-embedding along with their motion modeled as a change in the pose space due to the applied actions. We train our model using a pair of point clouds separated by an action and show that given supervision only in the form of point-wise data associations between the frames our network is able to learn a meaningful segmentation of the scene along with consistent poses. We further show that our model can be used for closed-loop control directly in the learned low-dimensional pose space, where the actions are computed by minimizing error in the pose space using gradient-based methods, similar to traditional model-based control. We present results on controlling a Baxter robot from raw depth data in simulation and in the real world and compare against two baseline deep networks. Our method runs in real-time, achieves good prediction of scene dynamics and outperforms the baseline methods on multiple control runs. Video results can be found at: https://rse-lab.cs.washington.edu/se3-structured-deep-ctrl/ "

The paper proves that a bound on the averaged Jones' square function of a measure implies an upper bound on the measure. Various types of assumptions on the measure are considered. The theorem is a generalization of a result due to A. Naber and D. Valtorta in connection with measure bounds on the singular set of harmonic maps.
"In this paper, we propose a novel projector-camera system for practical and low-cost acquisition of a dense object 3D model with the spectral reflectance property. In our system, we use a standard RGB camera and leverage an off-the-shelf projector as active illumination for both the 3D reconstruction and the spectral reflectance estimation. We first reconstruct the 3D points while estimating the poses of the camera and the projector, which are alternately moved around the object, by combining multi-view structured light and structure-from-motion (SfM) techniques. We then exploit the projector for multispectral imaging and estimate the spectral reflectance of each 3D point based on a novel spectral reflectance estimation model considering the geometric relationship between the reconstructed 3D points and the estimated projector positions. Experimental results on several real objects demonstrate that our system can precisely acquire a dense 3D model with the full spectral reflectance property using off-the-shelf devices. "
